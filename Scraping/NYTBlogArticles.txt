SATURDAY PUZZLE — Some puzzle constructors are attracted to a marquee phrase as their seed entry and some constructors can’t resist the Scrabbly allure of the rarer letters of the alphabet when selecting a place to start filling their themeless grids. Today, David Phillips shows us what it’s like to fall for the allure of the letter X.
Sure, it’s attractive. And when it has a twin, as in the clothing chain T.J. MAXX? Hard to say no, isn’t it, Mr. Phillips? But is it a store that everyone knows? They are very popular in the northeastern United States, but I don’t know whether they are national or international. Research suggests that the chain has stores in several large cities, but raise your hand if you live in a non-metro area and recognize it as a competitor to Kohl’s.
The entry that caught my eye was HATERS GONNA HATE, a lively way to start off our solving year. I also liked SKIN TIGHT (which comes out of retirement after it’s last New York Times usage in 1953), POWER GRAB, ALL SPICE, AVALANCHE, TAKE A DIVE, RAISINETS (because yum) and LEFT TURN. I was not familiar with NESSES as a synonym for “promontories.” 
Clue(s) of the Day for me are “Mass master?” for J.S. BACH and “Input signal?” for CARET (it’s funnier if you’re an editor), followed closely by “Roman leader?” for GRECO.
Let’s check in with Mr. Phillips:
Oh, right! That’s my cue!

Many of us who grew up savoring the subversive humor and psychological sophistication of the early “Peanuts” comics have had to confront the question: When did it go bad? When did it lose its edge and become a maudlin “Happiness is a warm puppy” Hallmark sentiment? In this deep and thoughtful piece, Sarah Boxer examines the theory that the emergence of Snoopy — the narcissistic upright-walking beagle — as the strip’s central character is to blame. The story offers a glimpse inside Charles Schulz’s complicated relationship with his characters and with his own success.  — Carolyn Ryan
Sometimes you read an article and think, sarcastically, “Wow, tough assignment.” You might have that reaction to this terrifically entertaining Maureen O’Connor piece about partying with millionaires in Gstaad. (The occasion is the annual gathering of A Small World, an international members-only club.) Or you might just be glad you stayed home, after reading retch-inducing details like this one: “Jimmy Choo has manufactured golden sleds, which everyone rides down the mountain.” — Dan Saltzstein
What accounts for Donald Trump’s political popularity? The answer, Vox suggests, is in the writings of the anthropologist and philosopher Dr. Ernest Becker, who wrote that supporting charismatic figures is an existential strategy to ward off terror. Terror of what? Read on. — Jack Begg
“What needs to be invented?” a musician-engineer named Andy Hildebrand asked his lunch companions in 1995. “Why don’t you make a box that will let me sing in tune?”one responded. That was a holy grail for inventors, and Mr. Hildebrand was the perfect person to take up the quest. Here is the back story behind Auto-Tune and the simple economics of why — love it or hate it — music studios had no choice but to adopt it. “Sometimes, I’ll tell people, ‘I just built a car, I didn’t drive it down the wrong side of the freeway,’ ” the story quotes him as saying. “But haters will hate.” — Dan Blumberg
We all get what we want from “Star Wars” — technological thrills, nostalgia, participation in the national conversation — but the author finds our modern political discourse too. In this essay he writes, “In Star Wars, I see now, art and analysis merge in a galaxy-sized reminder that politics — that indefinite combination of power and money, family drama and national fate, our better angels and our inner demons — is the most irresistible of human activities to ponder.” — Jennifer Steinhauer

Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign raised $37 million in the three-month period that ended Dec. 31, filling the war chest of a campaign that has pulled in more than $112 million overall for the Democratic contest, her campaign said Friday.
The campaign spent $74 million of that money in 2015 as it established a ground operation in states beyond the four early nominating contests, and it invested heavily in Iowa and New Hampshire, where Mrs. Clinton’s main Democratic rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, has strong support.
“We are now heading into Iowa and New Hampshire with the resources we need to be successful,” Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, said in a statement announcing the figures.
Mr. Sanders, who has rejected the support of a “super PAC,” amassed an army of small-dollar donations in raising about $26.2 million in the previous quarter, when Mrs. Clinton raised $29.9 million. The Sanders campaign has not yet released its fourth-quarter figures.
Mrs. Clinton relies more heavily on larger donations. She has spent months crisscrossing the country to attend fund-raising events that bring in up to $2,700, the maximum donation allowed for the nominating contest. But her campaign has received a wave of smaller donations, particularly after Mrs. Clinton’s testimony before the Benghazi committee in Congress and following her debate performances, aides said.
The campaign declined to say what percentage of the $37 million it brought in the fourth quarter came from small contributions.
In a sign that the Clinton operation is also looking past the nominating contest, the campaign said that while it was only soliciting donations for the primaries, it had also raised $1 million in donations to be used in the general election.
Mrs. Clinton also raised more than $18 million for the Democratic National Committee and state parties throughout the country where Democrats at the state level have suffered losses.
Two of the Republican candidates, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ben Carson, have released their fund-raising totals for the quarter, with Mr. Cruz raising $20 million, a two-thirds increase over his previous quarter, and Mr. Carson raising $23 million.

RIO DE JANEIRO — L.A.T.I., the Italian owned and operated air line which is the only trans-Atlantic link between the Rome-Berlin Axis and the Western Hemisphere, completed its first year of operations today [Dec. 23]. In spite of the war in Europe, it is still making weekly flights with land planes between Rome and Rio de Janeiro. It is an important line, for by it the Axis reaches South American countries and the United States without running the risk of confiscation or censorship at a British control station. 
The New York Herald Tribune has been able to obtain precise information about the operation of L.A.T.I., especially in the months since Italy’s entrance into the war on June 10, when France was collapsing. Since that day there have been thirteen westbound flights on which the line has carried a total of nine passengers, five tons of mail and five and a half tons of cargo valued at $100,922.48. There have been only two disasters since the service was inaugurated. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Jan. 2, 1941

After I posted on Twitter to promote a fine Times story about a Missouri flood victim, a reply* directed my attention to a column by Tony Messenger in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch showing, yet again, how communities ignore inconvenient hydrological and geophysical realities:

Please read the piece in full here and pass it along to anyone who might want to try to nudge communities toward a more rational relationship with the landscapes and waterways around us.
The themes echo those described by Susan Saulny in this 2007 article in The Times: “Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains.. And there’s this 2011 Dot Earth post: “More on Tornadoes, Floods, Climate and Risk.” And of course the issues are not limited to the Mississippi River region. Here’s last year’s example: “In Texas, the Race to Build in Harm’s Way Outpaces Flood-Risk Studies and Warming Impacts.”
The 1994 federal report that Messenger mentioned is subtitled “a blueprint for change.” If only….

Sydney Festival
Various venues
Jan. 7-26.
This sprawling theater, music and dance festival includes performances from local and international companies at Sydney’s top venues. Highlights in this year’s festival include “La Verità,” a circus piece inspired by the work of Salvador Dalí; a performance by Mexrrissey, a Mexican band that plays music by The Smiths and Morrissey, translated into Spanish; and a take on the glum Georg Büchner play “Woyzeck,” by the singer-songwriter Tom Waits, the musician Kathleen Brennan and the artist Robert Wilson. The spoken word artist Kate Tempest will also perform at the festival.

Francis Alÿs: A Story of Negotiation
MALBA
Through Feb. 15.
The Mexico-based artist Alÿs’s multimedia artworks blend social commentary with a sense of the absurd. In his film “Reel-Unreel,” a child rolls a reel of film through the streets of Kabul, Afghanistan. Another work on view here shows a series of wooden automatic weapons arranged in a circle, aimed at one another. 
Cinderella
Teatro alla Scala
Through Jan. 15.
The choreographer Mauro Bigonzetti’s production of Prokofiev’s “Cinderella” updates the ballet to the vague present-day, with video designs and villains clad in macabre costumes. The star dancers Roberto Bolle and Polina Semionova will perform together as Cinderella and Prince Charming on Jan. 12, 14 and 15. 
A Centennial Exhibition: INOUE Yuichi
21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art
Jan. 2-March 21.
In the years after World War II, the artist Inoue Yuichi (1916-1985) made a name for himself in Japan by pioneering a new style of calligraphy that blended the principles of European abstraction with the traditions of the Japanese handwriting technique. This exhibition surveys the artist’s works, some completely abstract, others that depicted subjects like animals, and still others that tackled topics like the violence inflicted on Tokyo during the war. 
The Mark of Malevich: Graphics from the State Tretyakov Gallery’s Collection
Tretyakov Gallery on Krymsky Val
Through Feb. 14.
Almost exactly 100 years ago, Kazimir Malevich unveiled his “Black Suprematist Square,” an all-black painting that became the hallmark of the Russian avant garde. This exhibition marks the centenary of the painting and the Suprematist art movement, which it helped spawn. Late last year, the museum announced that researchers had discovered an inscription under the paint on Malevich’s black square — a satirical reference, they believe, to a painting by a 19th century French artist. 
Carlo Portelli: Pittore eccentrico tra Rosso Fiorentino e Vasari
Galleria dell’Accademia
Through April 30.
The 16th century Florentine artist’s work features in some prominent collections — including the Galleria, where one of his altarpieces is on display alongside Michelangelo’s David. His name remains somewhat obscure. This exhibition brings together a wide swath of his artwork, which combines Christian and pagan themes. Some of the artist’s work harks back to early Renaissance styles, while others have the stylized look of his contemporary, Michelangelo. 
Whenua Ora/Upon the Land
Waikato Museum
Through April 3.
Artworks by about two dozen Maori — the indigenous people of New Zealand — are on view in this exhibition. Artists include relative unknowns and an anonymous 19th century weaver along with those who have achieved international renown, like Buck Nin, Paratene Matchitt and Shane Cotton. 
Pelléas et Mélisande
Barbican Center
Jan. 9 and 10.
The conductor Simon Rattle, who will take up the mantle of music director of the orchestra in 2017, will take the podium on Jan. 9 and 10 to lead a semistaged version of Debussy’s opera “Pelléas et Mélisande,” directed by the iconoclastic theater director Peter Sellars. The show kicks off a new collaboration between the duo, who plan to stage a work together each year. 
Jean-Etienne Liotard
Royal Academy
Through Jan. 31.
The star of the Swiss painter Liotard (1702-89) rose quickly in Europe in the 18th century. He had prominent commissions from many of the Continent’s royals, including Marie Antoinette. He also had a strong interest in the east, and traveled to Istanbul, training his eye on unusual subjects for an artist of his era, like dwarves and Ottoman musicians. This exhibition showcases his portraits, still lifes and sketches. 
Lurid Beauty: Australian Surrealism and its Echoes
NGV Australia
Through Jan. 31.
In the 1930s, the Surrealist art movement, which emerged in Europe just after World War I, began to gain steam in Australia. This exhibition showcases the young Australian artists involved in the movement, like Albert Tucker and Max Dupain. It also shows work by some of their later heirs, like Sidney Nolan, who made paintings in the vein of Salvador Dalí; and Leigh Bowery, whose work included video pieces, photographs and interviews in which he dressed as an androgynous clown.

LONDON — The Admiralty announces that the P. and O. line steamship Persia, 7,974 tons, which left London for Bombay, was torpedoed and sunk by an enemy submarine on Thursday [Dec. 30]. The vessel carried 300 crew and 235 passengers, including 86 women and 30 children, and as only four boatloads escaped, it is feared that this culmination of the wholesale slaughter of innocents in 1915 by enemy submarines is only eclipsed in horror by the sinking of the Lusitania on May 7, when the sea-murderers sent 1,198 innocent persons, including hundreds of Americans, to a watery grave. 
The latest report is that four boatloads of survivors of this latest Hun horror were picked up by a steamer bound for Alexandria, and until her arrival there it is impossible to obtain a list of those saved, but among the passengers of the ill-fated liner are included scores of nursing sisters and other brave women travelling on a mission of mercy. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Jan. 2, 1916

Donald J. Trump shrugged off his appearance in a recruitment video posted Friday by the Shabab, an Al Qaeda affiliate, saying there was little he could do about it.
“What am I going to do?” Mr. Trump told John Dickerson of CBS News, who hosts “Face The Nation.” “I have to say what I have to say.”
He added: “They’ve used other people too.”
The remarks were Mr. Trump’s first concerning the Shabab’s video. The video emerged two weeks after Hillary Clinton, who leads in polls of the Democratic contest, said in a debate that Islamic State terrorists were using videos of Mr. Trump’s comments about Muslims as a recruitment tool. There was no evidence of that when she made those remarks.
The video released by the Shabab featured a clip of Mr. Trump calling for a temporary ban on Muslims coming into the United States in the wake of the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif.
At a rally Saturday night in Biloxi, Miss., Mr. Trump pointed to his candidacy as the right one to challenge “certain advantages” that Democrats have electorally.
“There are certain advantages that they have — you have to pick the right guy,” Mr. Trump said. Republican leaders and donors have repeatedly said that Mr. Trump’s comments about immigrants and Muslims will harm the party’s prospects of attracting new voters among emerging electoral groups such as Hispanics.
Mr. Trump blamed Mrs. Clinton and President Obama for the rise of the Islamic State. And he suggested that his supporters were the best possible to have.
“We have the smartest people — we sort of have everything,” he said, adding that everywhere he goes, “We’re all the same. We all — everybody I see, they want to make America great again.”
At another point, he praised the Second Amendment and promised to “unsign” any executive orders by Mr. Obama adding restrictions on obtaining guns.
Mr. Trump also led the crowd in a period of sustained booing of the news media at the back of the packed arena, singling out one cameraman as the focus of his ire and calling his own treatment by the press “unfair.”
If he could, Mr. Trump said, he would fire the cameraman right now, a remark that drew great applause.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — If you thought that 2015 went by quickly, just try this puzzle by David Woolf. He’s going to set a record for making the year go by in a flash.
There are 12 rebuses in today’s puzzle, one for each abbreviated month of the year. To do this, Mr. Woolf has essentially created 12 separate sectors in his grid, although there are multiple ways to get into and out of them. What impressed me was that he was able to do this and maintain the maximum 140 words in his puzzle.
I tumbled to the rebus theme midyear, in JUNe, because I knew that CARL (JUN)G wrote “the Undiscovered Self,” and that the crossing was AD(JUN)CT. A JUN rebus could only be the month abbreviated, so the rest was fairly easy, especially after I noticed the 12 sectors.
Here’s a sign that one’s priorities might need readjusting: I learned that BanJUL was the capital of Gambia based on my knowledge that Mint (JUL)EPS are popular Kentucky Derby drinks, and I learned that Turkish inns were called I(MAR)ETS based loosely on my knowledge of “The Simpsons” (Abu’s Kwik-E-Mart reminded me of MINI(MAR)T). Don’t judge. It got me the crossings I needed.
I absolutely loved the New York-centrist quote from Supreme Court Justice Sonia SOTO(MAY)OR: “I am a New Yorker, and 7 a.m. is a civilized hour to finish the day, not to start it.” I am no longer able to keep those hours like I used to, but I can appreciate the fact that the city never sleeps. At the very least, it’s awesome to be able to find any type of cuisine you want at just about any hour of the day or night.
Clue(s) of the day for me include “Band that doesn’t play much music nowadays” for AM RADIO, “Something you can believe in” for DOCTRINE, “Mural’s beginning?” for INTRA, “Guy’s thanks?” for MERCI and “Icy remark?” for BRRR. Honorable mention goes to “Ones up in arms” for the crosswordese ULNAS. 
Now that we’ve whizzed through 2016, let’s hear from Mr. Woolf:
GOTYE (pronounced “Gaulthier”) came to the attention of the music world in 2012 with the ultimate break up song, “Somebody That I Used To Know”:

This week, we’re sharing stories from children, teenagers and families about the charities that inspire them to give time, money and passion. The League of YES, formerly known as the Miracle League of Long Island, inspired Edward and Kelli Kanaley to write.
A few years ago, my wife and I were seeking volunteer opportunities for our two children, then in fifth and fourth grades.  When we began our search, we were surprised by the lack of volunteer opportunities for younger children. Our children were speaking with their aunt, who lives in South Carolina and who volunteered for a baseball league for special needs children in that state. They decided that they would like to participate in something similar to that here in New York. Fortunately for us, we found the League of YES, formerly known as the Miracle League of Long Island.
The League of YES is a nonprofit organization dedicated to taking the joys of baseball and teamwork to special needs children from across Long Island. Each player is assigned to a team, which is coached by volunteers. Each player gets to participate to the best of their ability and the league uses volunteers known as “Buddies” who assist the players one-on-one. This is where our children fit in. The “Buddy” (Because Unbelievable Dedication Deserves You) help the players hit the ball and navigate the bases while also socializing and forming long-lasting friendships.  Our children have developed special friendships with both players and other Buddies.
Our children, Tim and Jaclyn, have now been Buddies for four years, and the experience has been incredibly rewarding. What amazes us the most is the eagerness with which our children want to participate.  For six Saturdays in the fall, and six Saturdays in the spring, our children get up early and head to the field ready to go at 8:30. (This is in addition to their own extracurricular and sports activities).
A few extraordinary things have occurred as a result our relationship with the League of YES.  For three out of the last four years, our children have applied for a scholarship offered by our school district, which honors a wonderful teacher who passed too soon. The scholarships require the winners to either utilize the money to improve themselves or donate the money for the benefit of other children.  Each time, our children decided to donate all of the funds to the League of YES.
Last winter, the league recognized our children’s efforts and awarded them their annual “Sea of Love” award.
We were so proud of them that they received this recognition and we couldn’t imagine being more proud of them at such a young age. However, at the beginning of the following spring season, we realized how much their efforts had come to inspire others.  During one of the first games, we were approached by a husband and wife who had just signed up to be volunteer coaches for the league.  They told us that they had read an article in our local paper about the children’s award and were inspired to give back themselves.  So they signed up to be coaches.
Our experiences over the last four years have been nothing short of miraculous. Everyone involved with the league is dedicated to seeing that the players leave each game with a smile on their face, and we can honestly tell you that they do. The lessons our children have learned and the compassion that they have shown, has been truly inspirational to us as parents.

Senator Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign raised more than $33 million in the final three months of 2015, as his wide base of small-amount donors enabled him to come within $4 million of the amount raised by Hillary Clinton, his rival for the Democratic nomination, his campaign said Saturday.
Mr. Sanders, a senator from Vermont, has now raised $73 million for his nomination fight, his aides said in a news release.
The campaign said more than one million individual donors had made more than 2.5 million contributions, passing President Obama’s previous record of about 2.2 million for the number of individual donations, which was set at the end of 2011.
“This people-powered campaign is revolutionizing American politics,” Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, said in a news release accompanying the release of the figures.
Mr. Sanders’s spending on the campaign also appears to have shot up. The campaign now has $28.4 million in cash left from the $73 million raised, the release said.
The release announcing the haul was replete with references to how, “unlike other campaigns,” Mr. Sanders was doing well with small-amount donors. The references were a veiled shot at Mrs. Clinton,  who raised $37 million in the last quarter and has taken in more than $112 million in donations over all. Mrs. Clinton also has a “super PAC” supporting her.
Mr. Sanders’s campaign has aggressively targeted and courted low-dollar donors, developing a deep network of people it could keep tapping for new contributions.
Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, struggled in the second and third quarters of the year to establish a low-dollar donor base, relying primarily on fund-raising events with ticket prices of $2,700 to bring in donations..
Last month, Mr. Sanders’s team said in a court filing related to a lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee over a denial of access to voter data that it anticipated losing $600,000 a day in donations. A spokesman for the campaign, Michael Briggs, said that was a reference to a short window of time and did not reflect the campaign’s daily intake of contributions.
Two of the Republican candidates, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ben Carson, have released their fund-raising totals for the quarter. Mr. Cruz raised $20 million, a two-thirds increase from his previous quarter, and Mr. Carson raised $23 million.

VARIETY PUZZLE — Marching Bands puzzles are so much fun and it is beyond me why more people don’t do them. 
Not only are they fun, but they’re magic. You fill in the Rows and gradually the Bands begin to appear. All you have to do is fill in what you missed in the Rows.
For example, and just to get you started, the first Row consists of the answers to the two clues “Los Angeles neighborhood where rap’s N.W.A. was formed” and “Chefs’ chapeaux.” The answers, which you write straight across the top at Row 1 are COMPTON and TOQUES. If you look at the Bands clue A, they also answer the first three clues: a) “Put on the ‘free’ list,” b) “The Lone Ranger’s sidekick” and the first four letters of c) “Press conference format (3 wds.).” The Bands answers are COMP, TONTO and QUESTION AND ANSWER, which wraps around the outer part of the square.
Now you fill in the rest and watch those Bands go marching. Fun, right?

Larry Summers, Brad DeLong, and yours truly are having a bit of a three-cornered dialogue about the role of models in policy, set off by Larry’s initial post about why he believes the Fed is making a mistake in raising rates. We’re now in round two – and before I get to the specifics, let me ask: Don’t you wish real life were like this? (Let me pull Marshall McLuhan John Maynard Keynes out from behind this sign.)
I mean, we’re having a serious discussion by people who have thought hard about these topics, and more than that, have a long history of hard thinking about economics. To the extent that the three of us differ, it’s not based on knee-jerk ideology, or simplistic slogans. Oh, and on the immediate question of whether the Fed should raise rates, we’re all agreed that it should not.
Compare this with what mainly happens in economic debate. Oh well.
Anyway, Larry now comes back with an assertion that his case against a rate hike rests largely on supply-side uncertainty, where I think textbook demand-side economics is already enough; and also with a statement that he’s OK in principle with policy judgments that aren’t based on models, and a critique of my Mundell-Fleming lecture arguing that policymakers’ fears that deficits can cause a disastrous loss of confidence don’t make sense. Brad responds by wondering exactly how the policymakers could be right in this case.
And that really gets at my point, which is not that existing models are always the right guide for policy, but that policy preferences should be disciplined by models. If you don’t believe the implications of the standard model in any area, OK; but then give me a model, or at least a sketch of a model, to justify your instincts. 
What, after all, are economic models for? They are definitely not Truth. They are, however, a way to make sure that the stories you tell hang together, that they involve some plausible combination of individual behavior and interaction of those plausibly behaving individuals. 
Take, for example, the famous open letter to Ben Bernanke demanding that he call off quantitative easing. The signatories declared that “The planned asset purchases risk currency debasement and inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fed’s objective of promoting employment.” OK, how is that supposed to work? What model of the inflation process do you have in which an expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet translates into inflation without causing an overheating of the labor market first? I’m not saying that there is no possible story along those lines, but spell it out so we can see how plausible it is.
What I said in my Mundell-Fleming lecture was that simple models don’t seem to have room for the confidence crises policymakers fear – and that I couldn’t find any plausible alternative models to justify those fears. It wasn’t “The model says you’re wrong”; it was “Show me a model”. 
The reason I’ve been going on about such things is that since 2008 we’ve repeatedly seen policymakers overrule or ignore the message of basic macro models in favor of instincts that, to the extent they reflect experience at all, reflect experience that comes from very different economic environments. And these instincts have, again and again, proved wrong – while the basic models have done well. The models aren’t sacred, but the discipline of thinking things through in terms of models is really important.

MONDAY PUZZLE — Well, if you are going to break into solving crossword puzzles as a New Year’s resolution, this is a pretty decent one with which to do it. This puzzle by Herre Schouwerwou is mostly easy to solve and the plethora of theme material is clued easily, so it won’t slow you down. Not only that, but you just know that any puzzle that debuts PINK FLOYD, POPPIN’ FRESH and PILLOW FIGHTS is going to be fun.
As you can see, the theme today is two-word phrases or names that each begin with the letters P___ F___. I like the fact that Mr. Schourwerwou was able to fit six theme entries, two of which are long Down entries that interlock with the Across theme entries, into his grid; that kind of theme interlock is an elegant touch.
In trivia news, Mr. Schouwerwou alerts us to the fact that April is the only month with AN I. I was not familiar with FARON Young, but I am now. And I have to say I’m enjoying the clues that are less about definitions and more about requiring you to be observant, like the April clue, or “What the numbers 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 are in” for REVERSE. They expand my brain.

Like one of its impossibly huge Imperial destroyers, “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” continued to cast a long shadow on the North American box office, collecting $88.3 million in its third weekend, as Quentin Tarantino’s “The Hateful Eight” sold fewer tickets than some analysts expected as it expanded nationwide.
“The Force Awakens” (Disney) has now sold $740.3 million in tickets at domestic theaters, according to Rentrak, which compiles box- office data. Disney said on Sunday that the film’s global total now stands at $1.5 billion; it opens in China on Saturday. Second place went to the comedy “Daddy’s Home” (Paramount), which took in a strong $29 million in its second weekend, for a new domestic total of $93.7 million.
“The Hateful Eight” (the Weinstein Company) expanded into 2,474 theaters — it had arrived the week prior in 100 — and managed $16.2 million in ticket sales, for a new total of $29.6 million. The weekend result, while strong for a violent drama that runs roughly three hours, was nonetheless a bit less than anticipated.

As President Obama moves closer to using executive action to tighten regulations on gun purchases, the Republican presidential candidates hoping to succeed him are accusing him of abusing power and promising to reverse such measures if elected.
Mr. Obama is meeting with Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch this week to discuss what moves he can take to curb gun violence. One possibility is focusing on who could be considered a high-volume dealer for an executive action that could expand background checks.
But Republicans say he is overstepping his authority.
“This president wants to act as if he’s a king, as if he’s a dictator,” Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey told Fox News Sunday. “This is going to be another illegal executive action which I’m sure will be rejected by the courts and when I become president, will be stricken from executive action by executive action I will take.”
Jeb Bush said that Mr. Obama was recklessly using authority that he does not have and infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens.
“It’s wrong,” Mr. Bush said on the same program. “To use executive power that he doesn’t have is a pattern that is quite dangerous.”
Describing Mr. Obama as lawless in his use of executive powers, Carly Fiorina argued that addressing gun violence required stricter enforcement of legislation that is already on the books.
“We have long lists of criminals who own guns, who routinely purchase guns,” Ms. Fiorina told CNN. “We know who these people are, and we are not prosecuting any of them.”
Donald J. Trump said Sunday that Mr. Obama’s reliance on executive actions to deal with gun violence showed his inability to make deals with Congress and promised that he opposes anything that gets in the way of the Second Amendment. At a rally on Saturday, Mr. Trump said that he would do away with any restrictions the president puts on guns if he wins the presidency.
“I will veto,” Mr. Trump said. “I will unsign that so fast.”
The billionaire businessman also showed no signs of letting up on his attacks against the Clintons, vowing to be the toughest opponent against Hillary Clinton in a general election.
“She’s caused death,” Mr. Trump said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “She’s caused tremendous death with incompetent decisions.”
Mr. Trump also defended making an issue out of former President Bill Clinton’s history of extramarital affairs and what Mr. Trump describes as abuse of women. He also tried to make the case that Mrs. Clinton was not a defender of women because of her husband’s behavior.
“You know, she’s not an innocent victim,” Mr. Trump told Fox News. “She was the one that would go along with him in this whole game that they play. And you look at what happened with some of the people that he took advantage of and then she gets involved. So she’s not like the innocent person sitting by the side with tears in her eyes.”

Premieres by Dianne McIntyre and Elena Kunikova, two stylistically different but longtime fixtures of New York dance, are in store for Dance Theater of Harlem’s coming engagement at City Center.
The two have created their dances as part of Women Who Move Us, a new program of Dance Theater of Harlem. Ms. McIntyre’s currently untitled work and Ms. Kunikova’s “Divertimento” will have their premieres at the troupe’s City Center season, which runs April 6 through 9.
Ms. McIntyre’s choreography will be her first on point, though it will stick to themes of cultural history, which  she is known for. Virginia Johnson, Dance Theater of Harlem’s artistic director, said it will “look at the strength of black women through the ages.” The work draws from Ms. McIntyre’s dance aesthetic and meets ballet halfway. “It’s going to be a really fascinating and beautiful combination of two styles of movement,” Ms. Johnson said.
Ballet is central to the life of Ms. Kunikova, a graduate of the Mariinsky ballet school who is known for dancing the works of Marius Petipa. “Divertimento,” itself a ballet term, is her way of drawing from her career to create something new. “She’s been living in this universe her whole life,” Ms. Johnson said, adding that this new dance is a “charming and beautiful classical work.”
The dance troupe’s run at City Center is to also include works by Robert Garland, Donald Byrd, Nacho Duato and Helen Pickett. Tickets are available at nycitycenter.org.

I’m incredibly proud of the book I wrote. I hope it has some of the things I love when I read other people’s work. I want readers to find the story funny and sad; honest and relatable. My characters fall in and out of love, they try things they never thought they would and things they will never admit to. And some of these things are dirty. This did not have to be a dirty book. At several points, I could have faded to black, like a 1950s Hollywood movie. No, this didn’t need to be a dirty book. It just gets to be.
As I worked to find an agent or publisher I entered a lot of Twitter contests.  You get 140 characters, including the contest hashtag, to pitch your opus. I got a text from my younger son, 19. His friend had told him, “I think your Mom’s Twitter was hacked.” He had to explain that I was indeed the author of those racy tweets. My older son’s roommates were even more intrigued. They followed me after they read my tweets and offered themselves as beta readers. 
Last July, I did land a publisher. I expected the book would release late spring dovetailing perfectly with my life. My youngest son will graduate from high school then. This would allow me the focus and time to promote the book and it would give my son some privacy. But the manuscript whipped through the necessary steps, editing, proofreading and cover design. The night before last, I got the news: It will release this winter. There goes my plan to get him out of high school before his mother’s dirty book hits Amazon. 
I’m trying to reconcile the years I put in to realize this long-held desire to publish against my family’s hope that I will simply keep being Mom. 
So, while I really want you to read my book, I kind of don’t want you to if we know one another through our children, our house of worship or my mother.
I wonder how E.L. James (do I even need to say, author of the infamous “50 Shades of Grey”) manages. She has two teenage sons. Does she sit at school conferences and talk to their math teacher about trigonometry, or bondage? Before she goes out for a day of errands, does she have to steel herself from too-knowing glances, or does she look at the balance in her checkbook and think: “Yeah. All’s good.” 
As an author, having a reader identify with one of my characters is like a runner’s high. When my book club read my manuscript, one discussion point was a pivotal disagreement between the main character and her best friend. The character confessed to an emotional affair and the best friend was upset on behalf of the character’s unsuspecting husband.
My book club friend asked: “Why would the best friend care? Is she in love with the husband?” 
Another woman answered: “Of course, she’d be upset. It changes the whole dynamic of all their relationships.” 
I fell to my knees, crying: “Yes! Yes!”  But only in my mind. In reality I went, “Mmmm,” and took another sip of chardonnay. 
A young man, a former co-worker, read the book and confided to me: “The sex scenes work. I mean work. Know what I mean?” I did know what he meant. I was as thrilled he’d responded so, um, viscerally, to my writing, as I was to the friend who understood what I wanted to share about the rhythms of friendship and love.
So I’m left to tiptoe through this minefield of pride and sensibility. If you shake your head at modern life and ruminate on the insanity of relationships, then I want you to read my book. But if we know each other exclusively because our children were confirmed together, then, maybe don’t read it. Or at least, hold off until July.
