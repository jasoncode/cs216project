The White house is refusing to deny the rumors that President Obama claimed he will relocate to Canada if Donald Trump is elected as his successor in November. 
The rumor began when Canadian satire website The Burred Street Journal ran a fictional story titled 'Obama Declares His Family Will Move To Canada If Trump Is Elected.' 
The story was complete with a fake statement from Obama which read, 'It's something Michelle, the kids and I have discussed as a potential solution to the Donald. I have also spoken with Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau who outlined Canada's generous immigration policy for wealthy individuals, so we'll see.' 
The story was immediately picked up by American newsrooms, who ran it with headlines like 'Obama Just Said He's Moving If Trump Is Elected, Sounds Good To Us!' 
When asked about the rumors, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest would not say outright that Obama is not considering a move to Canada should the American people elect Trump. 
'He's working very hard to make sure that nobody has to leave the country as a result of an electoral outcome that the president doesn't support,' said Earnest, according to MRC Blog . 
While this all originated as a rumor, the White House's decision not to categorically deny the reports had any validity only makes it appear as though Obama may actually consider moving out of the country if Trump is elected. 
Do you think Obama would ever leave the US? Leave your thoughts in the comments section!

Biden said he'd like to throw down with Trump … now Trump responds. Did Biden see this coming? He should have, it's Trump! 
We all knew it would happen, 2016 has been a roller coaster of crazy and unruly behavior from the left and their minions…that it would only be fitting to end it with a duel. 
All that's left now is for each opponent to choose their weapon. 
Donald Trump responded to Biden's statement very literally. Stating he 'would really love' to accept the challenge to a fistfight. 
I can see Biden swinging wildly already…with his eyes shut and his head ducked. 
Biden on Friday slammed Trump's now infamous taped 2005 comments that famous men could mistreat women with impunity: 'When you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the p****. You can do anything.' 
Asked if he wished he could debate Trump, a furious Biden replied that he wished he were in high school so 'I could take him behind the gym.' 
Trump, 70, cast himself as the alpha male Tuesday night in Tallahassee, delivering the rhetorical equivalent of a 'Let's step outside' to the 73-year-old Biden. 
Seriously though, since this campaign for President is already pure madness. Lets just pretend they were about to get down in a boxing match…who do you think would win? 
Dems cheat so… 
They would pull a number on Trump like the end fight in Gladiator. Stab him in the side, and let him bleed out during the match… Related Items

Sometimes racial profiling doesn't work in your favor. That's what an MSNBC reporter found out when he tried to interview a group of three black citizens in line for early voting in South Carolina. 
The reporter deliberately tried to bait the black voters into saying something negative about Trump, and was shocked to find out that they were actually supporters of the Republican nominee. 
'We've heard a lot of criticism of Trump's inner city policy, but what do you make of that criticism? I'm sure you've heard it…' questioned the reporter. 
'Well, I think that Trump's reaching out to all citizens, including African-Americans. I think he's trying to address a problem,' responded one of the women. 
'It shouldn't be a problem if you address that there's something's wrong and that you've got a plan to want to help people. That what a president should do for us, he should reach out and try to help people and address problems that are going on in our country.' 
Not yet deterred, the reporter tried to bait them again, asking, 'Some of the criticism has been because he'll often say, 'What do you have to lose?' Being specifically African-American, what do you think about that criticism?' 
'My word to all black Americans, one thing I would like to say,' answered another woman. 'Let's not be deceived. Look at the record. Look at the promises that have been made over the past from the Democratic Party. We're not voting for a party, we're voting for a man who has been standing by…' 
'He loves America! That's what I love about him – he loves America. We need somebody that loves America. And he also loves all people. All people! And there's that deception out there that he has no black supporters. WRONG! He does!' 
Well, all that was just way too much Republican support for MSNBC to handle and the reporter immediately ended the interview.

In a four-minute speech beforeÂ an Ohio audience reportedly to publicize his new movie 'Trumpland,' staunch liberal Michael Moore delved into the mindset of Donald Trump's appeal. In doing so, he inadvertently made the best case for a Trump presidency we've heard yet. 
'Theyâre not racists or rednecks, theyâre actually pretty decent people,' Moore surprisingly said of Trump supporters. 'So, after talking to a number of them, I sort of wanted to sort of write this.' 
Here is an excerpt from his speech: 
Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives and said: if you close these factories, as you are planning to do in Detroit, and rebuild them in Mexico, I am going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobodyâs going to buy them. 
It was an amazing thing to see. 
No politician â Republican or Democrat â had ever said anything like that to these executives. And it was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Brexit states. You live here in Ohio. You know what I am talking about. 
Whether Trump means it or not is kind of irrelevant because he's saying the things to people who are hurting. And it's why every beaten down, nameless, forgotten, working stiff, who used to be part of what was called the working class, loves Trump. He is the human Molotov cocktail that they've been waiting for; the human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them.

When Obamacare was voted in, it was by ALL Democrats, not one single Republican voted that garbage to existence. Now here we are with premiums skyrocketed, and set to increase EVEN more come 2017…to ridiculous heights. It's all a huge mess…I mean… HUGE! 
Not everyone understands this, in the way they should. They only understand that they are losing money and the anxiety from it all is nearly throwing them into depression. I mean, we're already working ourselves to the bone to live the 'American Dream' that Obama has put so far out of reach in these last 8 years…do we really ALSO have to worry about being able to afford…staying ALIVE!? 
This is scary people! …and more should understand WHY it's happening, so they can help do something about it. 
This video needs to go viral… 
Now I give you the new video…. 'Broken Promises' 
Wasn't that SPOT ON! 
Why does this need to spread everywhere? Because this is America, and we do not need to sit still and take this kind of abuse from the people making the choices in D.C. 
WE ARE THE PEOPLE! So we need to vote those asshats out of there, and get some people into the White House that actually love America and her people. 
It's our country… squeeze the greed out of DC and exile it until forever. Related Items

WOW! Liberals can't even let a down and out homeless person have their own opinion either!? What bullies! This homeless black woman took takes up guard for Trump's hollywood star that got destroyed by a CRAZY liberal the other day, and now liberals are all up in her grill trying to tell her why she's wrong to do so. 
How dare they right? After they are done shouting at her about how wrong she is…they get to go home to warmth and food. While she remains in the streets…they need back off! She has a right to believe what she wants to. 
What the libs REALLY didn't take well to…was her signs, she was very real about how she felt about Obama and his treatment of black people specifically and Americans in general!

When the creator of 'Dilbert', Scott Adams, sat down to decide who he would endorse for President, it didn't take him very long. His method of deciphering right from wrong was pretty simple… he looked for the truth. 
The question he asked himself was: 'What common traits bind Clinton supporters together?' 
You're going to fully support the answer he came up with… 
Check this out! 
'I've been trying to figure out what common trait binds Clinton supporters together. As far as I can tell, the most unifying characteristic is a willingness to bully in all its forms. Have a Trump sign in your lawn? They will steal it. If you have a Trump bumper sticker, they will deface your car. 
If you speak of Trump at work you could get fired. On social media, almost every message I get from a Clinton supporter is a bullying type of message…We know from Project Veritas that Clinton supporters tried to incite violence at Trump rallies. The media downplays it. We also know Clinton's side hired paid trolls to bully online. You don't hear much about that…' 
See what happens for people that actually 'think' things through? They come up with logical answers and start off on whatever endeavor they are facing on the right foot! 
He's absolutely right! Clinton followers tend to yell and judge everyone else for 'sins' that they themselves are living in as they are pointing the finger at others! All things racist, sexist, bigoted, and telling us all we are these things because we lack tolerance, when in fact, that isn't the case at all…is BULLYING! 
Which is rather IRONIC don't you think? Because they also go on and on about how they are against bullying and we all need to be tolerant. Yet are constantly inciting violence, and condoning intimidation towards ALL who do not agree with them. 
Here's the endorsement, and it's glorious. 
'I endorse Donald Trump for President of the United States because I oppose bullying in all its forms. I don't defend Trump's personal life. Neither Trump nor Clinton are role models for our children. Let's call that a tie, at worst. Today I put Trump's odds of winning in a landslide back to 98%. Remember, I told you a few weeks ago that Trump couldn't win unless 'something changed.' Something just changed.' 
That's right. Trump is no angel, but Hillary is Satan. Trump loves America and for now, in the state we are in, that's going to do a WHOLE lot of good. Some feel this election is about picking your poison, which is the least potent. I believe, it's about picking what's best for America. First step…would be choosing someone who loves this country. After 8 years of being under the reign of someone who hates this country, this should be clear. 
Because this is the alternative… Related Items

 Do you think that this Veteran's actions were wrong? I think that #BAMASITS student protesters are a bunch of BLM Hippie whiners! Way to go, Colin Kaepernick! Your actions as a millionaire whiner in the National Football League have now influenced the young minds of young students at college football games. These kids are not even equipped with enough mental toughness to consider basic issues. You believe that your actions will help them to create a better life? Evidently, protesting the National Anthem is a fad that is not quite ready to die. One recent iteration can be found at the University of Alabama, where students use the hashtag #BAMASITS in an attempt to draw attention to their cause. These little babies have the right to protest, but like many who have a liberal mindset, they are only tolerant of others who share their views. If you stand up for your own views, as this Veteran did, you are behaving in ways that are 'outside of your rights.' One representative of #BAMASITS, Emerald Vaughn, described the group like this: '#BAMASITS is a peaceful protest. We are protesting social injustice. We support underrepresented LGBTQ community and people of color against discrimination and we're also protesting against police brutality.' Fine, Emerald. Have your protests. One question, though: What is wrong with a Veteran of the United States military standing during a game and sharing his own views? Teddi Badami, an Air Force Veteran, decided that he would do just that. Video has surfaced of the #BAMASITS crowd protesting the National Anthem at Bryant-Denny Stadium, prior to the Texas A&M game, when Badami stood in front of their protest with his hand over his heart. Badami simply stood and sang along with the words of the National Anthem. 'I politely stood up to ask him, could you move and he said he was a veteran. I respect veterans, I don't have anything against veterans but I felt like you shouldn't try to invade and bully your way. That was total disrespect and disregard of our protest,' said Vaughn. Clearly, Badami does not feel that way. Take a look at video footage of the event, below: #bamasits says a veteran interrupted their peaceful protest, the vet says otherwise.

Do you believe that Badami was out of line? 
'I stood there with my hand over my heart and sang the national anthem loud and proud. I made no comments to any of the individuals other than I stand for the national anthem and that I served our country,' Badami said. 
'I felt that it was disrespectful, he can have his own, whatever his points that he wanted to make, he could have did that on his own. People fight over, they fight our wars with veterans for us to have the right to sit or stand for the national anthem,' Vaughn said. 
Badami says he and his friend returned to their seats after the anthem but were temporarily detained by campus police. 
Detained by campus police? Give me a break!

Not a lot of teenage boys would go out of their selfish ways to stand up for a teacher like this. He stood up for his teacher when his peer punched her in the face. This young man is certainly respectable! 
A shocking video has emerged showing the moment a protective student knocked out a classmate who had just attacked their female teacher. The footage shows that the teacher was trying to break up a fight between two students – one in a red hoodie and one in a black hoodie – when the boy in the red turns around and hits her in the face. The teacher, dressed in white and wearing glasses, appears to fall to the ground after being hit, and then leaves the classroom. 
Then, a third student comes in and punches the boy in head, sending him straight down to the ground. The third student is heard saying: 'Watch the f— out, you just hit the fucking teacher.' He then adds: 'Chill your s—, you just hit the f—ing teacher, you don't f—ing do that. Who the f— do you think you are?' 
The teacher then reappears in the room, and appears relatively unscathed. She tells the group to stop fighting and separate.'He just f—ing hit you, that's not cool,' says the boy that came to her defense.'It's not cool,' the teacher replies. It is unclear where the video was filmed or what school was involved, however the clip was spreading quickly on social media on Wednesday after appearing on the website LiveLeak. Some viewers questioned whether the boy in red may have mistakenly hit the teacher, believing she were the other one of the students. However others said he clearly meant to hit the woman. 
Shout out to the boy for standing up for what is right! Related Items

 Obama was speaking to donors at a private fundraiser in California when he railed against former House Oversight Committee Chair Darrell Issa for calling his administration corrupt. 
'Here's a guy who called my administration perhaps the most corrupt in history — despite the fact that actually we have not had a major scandal in my administration,' Obama said! 
Obama has had more scandals than any president in history! Just because the MSM refuses to report on them does not mean they do not exist! 
Breitbart reports : 
Issa was the key figure in several investigations of the Obama administration, including the Fast and Furious debacle with Attorney General Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton's failure in Benghazi, the failures in the Veterans Affairs department, and the IRS using its power to target conservative Tea Party groups for investigations. 
Obama accused Issa of wasting taxpayer money 'on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere.' 
'This guy has spent all his time simply trying to obstruct, to feed the same sentiments that resulted in Donald Trump becoming their nominee,' Obama said. 
We could list 77 scandals, but here are just 7 of the biggest! 
1.) IRS Targeting Scandal 
In 2013, Lois Lerner, former director of the IRS Exempt Organizations division, admitted that officials in the IRS' Cincinnati office acted improperly. 2.) VA Waiting List 
The Department of Veterans Affairs inspector general first noted the waiting list problem at a Phoenix clinic in 2014 and then found other clinics with similar problems. Veterans were placed on phony waiting lists, and some even died while waiting for care. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned from his position. 3.) GSA Spending Spree 
In 2012, Martha N. Johnson, the administrator of the General Services Administration, resigned after the federal procurement agency was engulfed in a controversy. The department was accused of allowing excessive spending on travel and conferences for the agency and employees. 4.) Attack on the Benghazi Compound 
On Sept. 11, 2012, weeks before a presidential election, terrorists attacked U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, Libya. Obama administration officials initially blamed this attack on a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim YouTube video that spun out of control. 5.) Clinton Emails 
It was the Benghazi committee that first discovered that before, during, and after her time as secretary of state, Clinton maintained a private email server. This prompted the FBI to investigate questions of whether Clinton violated the law in terms of storing classified information. 6.) Fast and Furious Gun Walking 
Operation Fast and Furious was a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives program, meant to be a sting operation. It allowed about 2,000 guns to flow to Mexican drug trafficking organizations under federal supervision before authorities lost control of the guns. 7.) Solyndra Subsidies 
The Energy Department provided a $535 million loan guarantee to the politically connected solar panel firm Solyndra as part of the 2009 stimulus bill. Not long after building its factory, the California firm filed for bankruptcy protection and an FBI investigation ensued. The company did not find a buyer and eventually closed down. So Barack Obama…just shut up!

 If you are one of the Americans DISGUSTED with Obama's Pentagon demanding 10,000 war Veterans pay back enlistment bonuses handed out a decade ago, get ready to be FURIOUS! 
Many of these Veterans served multiple combat tours and the bonuses were used to entice them to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan! Many have lost limbs and have suffered! 
I would imagine that some are deceased and their spouses or family are having to deal with this! 
But the headlines read: U.S. Defense Secretary orders Pentagon to stop asking veterans to repay reenlistment bonuses 
He is only suspending until he is 'satisfied that our process is working effectively.'. In other words, until this dies down so that they can go back to stealing from our fine Veterans! Secretary Carter and the Pentagon are NOT stopping this insanity! ABSOLUTELY NOT Ash Carter. This CHANGES NOTHING! 
You are still going about taking that money, just later after the anger dies down! I ain't falling for it! 
If you are hurting for money, why don't you ask the Iranians for some of those BILLIONS Obama just handed them back! Don't you DARE do this to our hardworking Veterans! 
You need to be giving the monies already collected back! The Pentagon needs to be saying, we are STOPPING this entirely! SHAME ON YOU! You are even CHARGING INTEREST on this 'debt'. I have never been so ashamed of the Pentagon and it's leadership in MY LIFE! Secretary Carter, you are a MORON ! 
We already pay our servicemen and women way too little for the sacrifices they make! Their healthcare is abominable and their benefits are abominable! And I KNOW what kind of standard of living you live Carter!! 
EVERYONE involved in this decision to to walk down this insane road with our war veterans need to be publicly spanked. YES!! EXACTLY what I mean. They need to be…in public…bare butt spanked. Pull them trousers down, lay them over a lap, and blister red those butts attached to those morons who are behind this scheme with a big Texas belt!. Seriously! 
Maybe if they faced that humiliation they might think twice again before making such an obnoxious decision against our veterans. 
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy pledged a House investigation of the problem, calling the Pentagon demands for repayment of bonuses from combat veterans 'disgraceful.' 
Congress best stop this insanity before it goes any further. Secretary Carter… DON'T YOU DARE try to deceive the American people and punt this down the road. 
Red Skelton famously said, 'From the people to the leaders, not the leaders to the people!' YOU Sir, are a public SERVANT..not a Master. The 'public servants' are the SLAVES and We the People are the masters because that is how this country was set up. 
You said today you have a responsibility to the American taxpayer! YES you do! You have a responsibility to STOP this MADNESS. We the People are not going away! You just set your legacy in stone! You might want to fix it!

With the possibility that America may elect the first female president in history, there has been much speculation surrounding what we would call her husband. 
During the 2008 election, Todd Palin joked that he liked to be referred to as the 'First Dude' when his wife was Governor of Alaska, and the term could be brought to the White House. 
But while speaking with the Daily Mail in North Carolina on Tuesday, Bill Clinton had another idea. 
'What I hope I'll be is the first volunteer,' the former president said. 'I hope to be the best free labor she's got.'

Lest anyone get the impression that Hillary Clinton would not do too much damage should she be elected, let's take a little stroll down memory lane, shall we? 
Earlier this year while on the campaign trail, Hillary was asked at a town hall meeting by one of her supporters, 'The next president will probably appoint several members of the Supreme Court. Would you consider appointing Obama?' 
Clinton replied enthusiastically, 'Wow! What a great idea! Nobody has ever suggested that to me! Wow! I love that! Wow! He may have a few other things to do, but I'll tell ya, that's a great idea!' 
God help us… 
This actually brings up a very important point, something many people have overlooked during this election cycle: If we do not elect Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton can stack the Supreme Court with liberal justices, and in doing so, irreversibly steer our country down the path of no return. The America our Founding Fathers envisioned and strived for will be nothing more than a distant memory.

Earlier this year, in a speech to the African Union while in Ethiopia, President Obama said, 'I actually think I'm a pretty good president. I think if I ran again, I could win. But I can't. The law is the law, and no one person is above the law, not even the president.' 
Obama may say he is not above the law, but it is abundantly clear that he thinks he is. He may need his head examined, though, if he actually believes he has been a 'good president.' ISIS is running rampant worldwide, the national debt has skyrocketed, and Obamacare has been a massive failure, just to name a few things. 
Now, the American people have spoken out in a poll. Apparently, they are not very happy that the president took it upon himself to assume they would vote for him a third time around. News flash, Mr. President, but many of us DID NOT vote for you the first or second time to begin with! 
According to the Rasmussen Reports poll, only one-third of Americans would vote for Obama if he ran for a third term, assuming that was constitutionally possible. Perhaps the president needs a refresher course on fractions, because one-third isn't exactly a majority… 
The results of the poll get worse for Obama, though. The amount of Democrats who would vote for him a third time is only 57 percent. That's just a little better than half of the members of his own party. Turns out, we're not the only ones who can't wait for him to vacate the White House! 
The Conservative Post reports that Rasmussen also showed that 63 percent of all likely voters would not support a third term. Even among independents, 68 percent would vote for another candidate. 93 percent of Republicans would not vote for Obama for a third term, and we're a little worried about that other 7 percent. 
SHARE this report if you think Barack Obama is one of the WORST presidents in the history of America, NOT one of the best!

 Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, an avid Black Lives Matter opponent, was named named Patrolmen's Benevolent Association's Person of the Year, infuriating liberals! 
'I think of Sheriff David Clarke the same way I regard Bull Connor. The same kind of law enforcement officer who would sick fire hoses and dogs on elderly women,' said one liberal who I refuse to give any fame. 
'He really is often times nothing less than a hate-monger.', said another. 
'I always cheer up immensely if an attack is particularly wounding because I think, well, if they attack one personally, it means they have not a single political argument left.', said former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
Liberals are idiots! They do not like the clear to understand outspokenness of Sheriff David Clarke because without throwing ad-hominem, they cannot defeat his message. 
Sheriff David Clarke hist back at gun control supporters, Black Lives Matter, Barack Obama, and a number of other liberal faves that want to destroy the freedom we all enjoy! 
Clarke's response to the Milwaukee protests in August have cemented his standing as one of the nation's most divisive law enforcement members. 
After the protesters took to the streets following the police shooting of a black thug, Clarke, who is black, blamed the unrest on 'tribal violence.' 
Clarke was appointed to a vacancy in 2002 by Governor Scott McCallum. He was later elected that same year to his first four-year term. 
He was re-elected in November 2006, 2010, and 2014, and is currently serving his fourth full term. 
Sheriff David Clarke is registered and elected as a Democrat, but is a vocal Trump supporter and very critical of Obama and Hillary.

 GOP VP candidate Mike Pence's Trump plane slid off the runway at LaGuardia airport Thursday evening, landing in the mud not far from the East River. 
The Trump plane stopped in the mud. It broke through a thin veneer of concrete designed to give way to keep planes from sliding into the river. 
No one was injured in the incident. Authorities say there could have been fatalities had the plane ended up in the water. 
KTLA 5 reports : 
Rescue crews were responding to the scene. The incident took place during a rainy night in the city. 
The press pool in the back of the aircraft could feel the plane fishtailing as it touched down and sliding off the runway before coming to a very sharp halt in the grass off the side of the runway. 
'We could feel the plane moving, and it was just not a natural landing that you experience,' CNN's Elizabeth Landers, who was on the plane, told CNN's Erin Burnett on 'OutFront.' 
Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Donald Trump's campaign, said the businessman called Pence shortly after the incident, adding that Trump 'is very glad everyone on-board the plane is safe.' 
There was some noticeable damage to the runway. A campaign spokesperson told reporters there was no structural damage to the plane. 
Landers said the Indiana governor's trip to New York had initially been delayed due to inclement weather. His plane was kept in a ground hold at the airport in Fort Dodge, Iowa, earlier in the day. 
Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the Department of Transportation, explained to CNN's Anderson Cooper that the weather likely prevented the plane from getting 'good traction.' There were 37 people on board at the time of the accident, including Pence. 
This could have been tragic. It is exponentially safer to fly in a plane than it is to ride in a car, but accidents still happen. Thank God all are safe.

So, if you don't trust voting machines, and you have good reason not to, you must demand a paper ballot. 
As it turns out, there may be some problems with paper ballots as well. 
One Conservative mother of two in Illionois reported that she had been hearing rumors of voter fraud. She talked to her friend, in South Carolina, and found the following: 
Would you look at that? The Democrat ticket of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine is listed twice, with Pacific Green/Progressive of Jill Stein/Ajamu Baraka and Libertarian Gary Johnson/Bill Weld also list. 
No Republican ticket of Donald Trump/Mike Pence listed! 
Others went online after voting, only to find that their mail in ballots, who listed Donald Trump as their candidate of choice, were not counted, supposedly because the signature on the ballot did not match the signature on the letter! 
Fortunately, these people checked and are taking action before it is too late. 
The Clinton Foundation, leftist billionaire George Soros, and the Democrats have power, and they have been shown to be corrupt. 
Do not let this kind of voter fraud happen to your vote! 
We cannot prove, right now, that the system is rigged, but something is not right.

A 19-year-old Texas A&M student has been arrested on a misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated, after crashing into the back of a Bryan Police Department patrol car at around 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday night. She had been distracted while trying to send her boyfriend a topless photo. 
Miranda Rader told the officer whose patrol car she crashed into that she had been trying to take the photo to send to her boyfriend on Snapchat. According to the police report, when the officer approached Rader, she had an 'unclasped brassiere' and was attempting to put her blouse back on. 
'I asked her why she was not dressed while driving and she stated that she was taking a Snapchat photo to send to her boyfriend while she was at a red light,' the officer wrote in the report, according to KBTX-TV. 
The officer was in the area because he had been called to a disturbance in the 2500 block of East Villa Maria Road in Bryan. He heard a car braking hard, then a crash. When he turned, he saw Rader's SUV had crashed into the back of his patrol car. It does not appear that he was in the vehicle at the time. 
Rader admitted to the officer that she was coming from a friend's house, where she had been drinking wine. She was on her way back to her on-campus dorm. Fortunately, no one was injured in the accident. 
According to Dallas News , the college freshman had an open wine bottle in the SUV and failed parts of a sobriety test before having her blood drawn. 
In years past, you only had to warn teenagers about the dangers of drinking and driving, but with the onslaught of social media and apps for smartphones like Snapchat, we now must also caution them against texting naked pictures of themselves while driving. Insane, isn't it?

Megyn Kelly seems to think that she can get away with anything she says or does. Rupert Murdoch gave her a rude awakening when he told her that there are tons of other qualified people that would kill to take her spot. 
Rupert Murdoch is making Fox News' salary negotiations with Megyn Kelly very public by granting an interview to one of the newspapers his company News Corp. owns, The Wall Street Journal. In the interview, Murdoch said that keeping Kelly is a priority, but that he has other hosts who could take over the program should she try and go to a rival network.'[W]e have a deep bench of talent, many of whom would give their right arm for that spot,' said Murdoch. Kelly, who is said to be making $15million this year, is reportedly looking to make more than $20million when she renegotiates her contract next July. She declined a request to comment on the story. 
Kelly's star has continued to rise over the past year, and next month she will be releasing her first book, Settle For More. It has also been revealed that Kelly will be appearing Live With Kelly! the day after the election, marking the first time she is set to appear on Ripa's morning show as a co-host. 
Her popularity is one of the main reasons Murdoch says he wants to get her contract signer 'very soon.' 
He added however that whether or not Kelly stays at the network is 'up to her.' It is unclear where Kelly might land if she does not stay with Fox News, but CNN seems like a very likely possibility for the popular host. Kelly also has a huge fan in CNN head honcho Jeff Zucker, who called her a 'tremendous anchor' earlier this year. And former CNN president Jon Klein applauded Kelly for not backing down to Donald Trump in the first Republican debate when she questioned him about his treatment of women, this despite the fact that her then boss Roger Ailes was a supporter of the Republican nominee.'To be able to stand up and ask tough questions to your boss's choice of president shows a certain steeliness,' said Klein. The article also points out that Kelly also separated herself from other Fox News anchors during the internal investigation into Ailes' alleged sexual harrassment by speaking with the lawyers hired to look into the claims being made by former host Gretchen Carlson. That revelation about Kelly's speaking with investigators was confirmed by people who were familiar with the matter. Some have said that Kelly is set to be the center of Fox News after the exit of Ailes, but Murdoch shot down those claims saying: 'We're not changing direction … that would be business suicide.' Murdoch also said that he wants to make sure Bill O'Reilly also resigns with the network when his contract is up next month. One rival news executive told Vanity Fair in August that the rivalry between Kelly and O'Reilly has devolved to the point that one of them will likely leave when their contracts expire. O'Reilly shot down reports of a feud between himself and Kelly in June however, telling The Hollywood Reporter: 'Oh, that's all fabricated. She's in a totally different part of the building. The last time I saw Megyn Kelly was in Detroit in March [at the Fox News GOP debate].' Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Fox News said: '[Fox News President] Bill Shine and [Executive Vice President, Programming & Development] Suzanne Scott have maintained a close relationship with Bill and Megyn for years and have helped both of them in many instances, all while co-existing under the same roof.' Kelly has previously hinted that she would be willing to leave the network where she has worked for the last 12 years 
'There's a lot of brain damage that comes from the job. There was probably less brain damage when I worked in the afternoon. I was less well known. I had far less conflict in my life,' Kelly said in an interview with Variety earlier this year.'I also have three kids who are soon going to be school from 8am to 3pm I come to work at 3:30. I like to see my children.' Kelly says she's thought about hosting her own talk show but isn't sure 'what the market looks like for that in 2016' and just doesn't think 'that's the perfect thing for me'. As for co-hosting a morning show like Today, Kelly said she's tried that before and she's not much of a morning person.'You have to wake up so early. The alarm goes off at 3:30am,' said Kelly.'When I did America's Newsroom, which started at 9am, I remember saying to the makeup artist at the time, 'If you could only know the afternoon me, you'd like me so much better.'' She then added: 'Listen, this is a fickle business. What if they called me and fired me tomorrow? I have to keep my options open.'

Trump has made is very loud and clear that once he gets into the White House, he will be executing 'OPERATION: DRAIN THE SWAMP OF D.C.' He wants to take out the corrupted trash that presides there and of course…make America great again. 
Now in a surprising move by Israel, we are learning exactly who they are rooting for. Something like probably has Hillary shaking in her pantsuit! 
Trump supporters are popping up all across the world. 
Check out the scene that unfolded in Jerusalem's Old City this week. 
On a rooftop overlooking the walls of Jerusalem's Old City, around 200 American-Israeli fans of Donald Trump gathered to proclaim their support for the Republican candidate, convinced he will be Israel's best friend if elected. 
Wearing 'Make America Great Again' baseball caps, the small crowd, ranging from Holocaust survivors in their 80s to grinning teenagers in Trump t-shirts, said they didn't care about the sexual assault allegations against the candidate or the online anti-Semitism of some of his supporters. 
'Trump will let Israel be itself and make its own decisions, that's what I like,' David Weissman, a 35-year-old from Queens, New York, who moved to Israel three years ago, said at the event late on Wednesday. 
'He's not a saint, but look at his achievements. He's not afraid to identify the enemy as radical Islam, and he's not going to support the two-state solution,' he said, referring to long-standing efforts to forge peace with the Palestinians. 
Trump has noticed the support he is getting in Israel. 
He even had a message for the people over there. 
This is a far cry from the attitude Obama has had all this time towards Israel. There are many things that Obama should be ashamed of from the past 8 years. He's ruined America. Cops are criminals, criminals are victims, and people are confused on whether they are a woman or a man, and much much more. 
However, the way he has poisoned the relationship with our very STRONGEST ally in the middle-east and has done so, as arrogantly as he has…is one of the top reasons why Obama has never been and will never be fit for leadership. 
We must ensure, his female counter-part…doesn't find her way back into the White House come November, and Israel agrees Related Items

 There are thousands of children who live under ISIS control and they are training them to kill and terrorize. They are teaching them to blow people up and shoot them. 
These ISIS children are becoming suicide bombers and they are executing people. Many have yet to reach puberty. 
Throughout history, evil has taken advantage of the innocence and pliability of children. ISIS has taken that to the extreme. 
This video will tear your heart in half and make you angry at the same time. 
If these children come to our shores, what do we do? How do we deal with this insanity? ISIS' children have proven to be effective weapons. ISIS is extremely organized in the preparation of these children. The Observer reports : 
While they learn the deadly art of warfare, the children are also schooled in the three Rs—readin', 'riting and 'rithmetic. ISIS runs a network of schools that the children attend. A Foreign Affairs piece by Mia Bloom attests to two schools that cater to English-speaking students. 
Some of the children are local, but many of them are foreigners, that is, not born and bred in Syria, Iraq or Yemen. The kids come from all over the world and the schools are set up to teach them in their native languages. They come from all over including China and Kazakhstan, from Belgium and Germany and England and the US. 
They even come from Israel. 
ISIS figured it out without our help. Children play a very large role in their own propaganda and recruiting materials. They also play central roles in their activity. Highly trained kids are referred to by ISIS elders as their 'cubs.' These 'cubs' are the crème de la crème. 
We face a religion of evil. It is not a religion of peace.These men are pure evil and this latest tactic proves such. I hope those in our government are thinking of how to deal with these children if they ever reach our shores. It will not be an easy solution.

A bit of good news to kick off your weekend… 
In an interview on the 'Sway in the Morning' radio show on Friday, President Obama stated unequivocally that his wife will 'never run' for political office. 
'She will never run for office,' said Obama of the 52-year-old First Lady. 'She is as talented and brilliant a person as there is, and I could not be prouder of her, but Michelle does not have the patience or the inclination to actually be a candidate herself. That's one thing y'all can take to the bank.' 
Michelle Obama has become Hillary Clinton's most effective surrogate on the campaign trail this election season, delivering powerful speeches on behalf of the Democratic nominee whom she hopes will become her husband's successor. 
The First Lady's success on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton has only led her supporters to push for her to launch her own political career, though she has long denied that she has any desire to run for political office. 
Indeed, it seems Michelle Obama is much more content living the high life, jet-setting around the world on expensive vacations, using only the most luxurious of accommodations, and paying for none of it herself. That's for the lowly taxpayers like you and me to do… 
Why hold a job or work to curry favor with the American people when your lavish lifestyle has been handed to you on a silver platter? Considering this, it's really no surprise Michelle Obama does not wish to run for office after her husband's term is over, and for that, we are grateful. 
SHARE this report if you are glad to hear that Michelle Obama will not seek political office after she vacates the White House in the coming months… Haven't we had enough of her?!

Hillary Clinton has reportedly been eyeing Joe Biden for Secretary of State. Creepy Uncle Joe Biden. 
A source familiar with Clinton's planning told Politico that Biden is at the top of her internal shortlist, but he has not yet been notified. The list is being prepared by Clinton's 'transition team.' 
According to the same source, Clinton's team is strategizing about how to approach the Vice President, who nearly ran against her in the primaries. 
'He'd be great, and they are spending a lot of time figuring out the best way to try to persuade him to do it if she wins,' said the source. 
From Politico : 
Among the names most discussed: former undersecretary of state Wendy Sherman, the point person on the Iran deal and a favorite within the State Department; former Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns, who now heads the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; Nick Burns, the former under secretary of state of political affairs under George W. Bush who's been an active advocate for Clinton this year; Kurt Campbell, Clinton's assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs when she was in the job; Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state during Bill Clinton's first term and a longtime friend of the Clintons who's now the president of the Brookings Institution; and James Stavridis, the retired admiral who earlier this summer made it into consideration as the sleeper pick to be her running mate. 
Despite being widely known for his numerous gaffes, Biden chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before joining the Obama Administration, and is one of the most experienced and respected Democrats on the world stage. 
He is coming to what would be the close of a 44-year career in Washington, first with six terms in the Senate and then two terms as President Barack Obama's closest adviser, and has expressed his desire to retire. 
In addition to his resumé, Biden would bring to the table a 'star power' none of Hillary's other picks could. 
To be fair, no one could possibly make a worse Secretary of State than Hillary herself, though Joe Biden might be a close second.

Well, I would have to agree with the Clinton camp on this one, for what will probably be the first and last time ever. Her supporters are 'f*cking dumb'… 
A new email released by Wikileaks as part of the Podesta dump reveals what the Clinton campaign really thinks of their millennial supporters. 
Marketing Executive Wendy Bronfein, who was introduced to Clinton campaign manager John Podesta in another email as someone who 'could be immensely helpful in improving HRC's connection to millennials,' advises on how to reach 'f**king dumb' young people. 
According to infowars , Bronfein tells Podesta that Clinton 'may not be the best face' to attract younger voters and that she needs to utilize 'trending figures' as part of an 'infusion to pull younger voters' because 'that's the crap that young people pay attention to.' 
She goes on to state, 'It's f**king dumb but being 'cool' counts for more than it maybe should.' 
'I hate to generalize a generation but by social media nature, they 'follow'. So if someone they identify as cool endorses – they will likely fall in line with that candidate,' writes Bronfein. 
Take a look… 
This is not the first time Clinton and her team have demeaned their own voter base. It was revealed in another email that Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accused Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being 'stupid.' 
And in an audio recording leaked earlier this month, Hillary Clinton was caught on tape saying that Bernie Sanders supporters are 'living in their parents' basement' and had bought into a 'false promise.' 
In yet another email, Clinton operative Bill Ivey spoke of the need to maintain political power by producing 'an unaware and compliant citizenry.' 
Indeed, WikiLeaks has been the gift that keeps on giving.

Man, you've got to hand it to WikiLeaks, for being such a hero in these last seconds of the race when the truth is needed the most. A new batch of damning evidence has just dropped and this time…what was found in them has to do with Bill Clinton…AND Bill Cosby. 
Pop some popcorn, you're in for a treat… 
Further proof Democrats are my favorite definition of 'stupid' 
They see the truth, they know the truth, still decided to push the lie…. 
This latest little revolution comes from an email in which Ron Klain, Chief of Staff to Joe Biden, posited a rather obvious series of questions to Camp Cankles: 
a. Is [Bill's] conduct relevant to your campaign? b. You said every woman should be believed. Why not the women who accused [your husband]? c. Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies? d. How is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did? 
Well hey, and this whole time we thought the Democrats were trying to ignore Cosby! He's getting some attention after all. 
Interestingly, Jake Sullivan of Camp Cankles couldn't come up with an answer to Klain's question. So he punted to John Podesta. 
Okay, so while the campaign is doing everything they can to target Donald Trump for his alleged nastiness, a the way back in January of this year, Clinton's campaign was wondering how they were going to handle Hillary's rapey chain and balls. 
Not only that, at least Ron Klain noticed that Hillary was being a dastardly hypocrite on the rape issue. 'b. You said every woman should be believed. Why not the women who accused [your husband]? c. Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?' 
Hillary's camp knew the issue would come up, sure. They were prepping their candidate for all the cannon balls lobbed her way. Because even the campaign knew Hillary couldn't hide behind a tampon-shield for everything. Especially a 'woman's' issue. Like her husband raping the ladies. 
Just goes to show even the Democrats knew Billy's rapescapades were a problem. 
YIKES! This right here is what might be going into the White House. People that don't seek the truth, but scramble to hide it with further lies and scheming ideas. 
It's sickening…but mostly, terrifying. To have this kind of crap in the White House…spells doom. Related Items

Wait! Using the death of Eric Garner to push 'Gun Control'? 
Hillary….THERE WERE NO GUNS INVOLVED! For some reason, the Hillary Camp does not know the difference. They just know Police are involved, and BlackLivesMatter hate police so they want to use it to push…. their agenda against gun. 
Even though…it makes ZERO sense. 
WikiLeaks has just released a batch of evidence that Eric Garner's daughter has read through…and good thing she did. Her own NAME is in it! Which got her furious… 
So she's speaking out… 
Erica Garner has become one of the more vocal #BlackLivesMatter activists after her father died while resisting arrest. Yes, we all have opinions about BLM, but that's not this post. Okay? Okay. 
This post is about how shameless leftists like the Clinton Campaign used a man's death for their own means, to push their own agenda. No, of course you're not surprised an entity like the Clinton campaign would use anyone for any reason whatsoever. Par for the course. What's different is how Erica has responded. Let's just say she's none too pleased. 
Side note reminder: Eric Garner, her father, wasn't even shot. No guns. 
So what got Erica justifiably peeved are some recent Wikileaks, which revealed the backdoor dealings of how the Clinton Campaign discussed Garner's case. Like how it could be used to further the anti-cop and anti-gun agendas. 
Garner first tweeted a link to leaked emails that appear to show internal discussions from the Clinton campaign about whether to mention her father's name in op-ed piece that Clinton was writing for the New York Daily News. 
'Finally, I know we have Erica Garner issues but we don't want to mention Eric at all? I can see her coming after us for leaving him out of the piece,' Clinton campaign aide Nick Merrill wrote. 
Erica Garner was not, shall we say, amused. These people will co opt anything to push their agenda. Police violence is not the same as gun violence.

Perhaps no country has been more welcoming of Muslims refugees to their own detriment than Sweden. 
Not only has the country accepted far more of these migrants than they can feasibly handle, but the nation has also bent over backwards to make them comfortable. Things have gotten so out of hand that Christmas lights have now been banned so as not to offend these devout Muslims. 
The Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) will not allow municipalities to erect Christmas street lights on light poles that the authority manages this year, which means that many towns will have no lights at all for the holiday. 
What a sad time for the native Christians in Sweden. 
To add insult to injury, Speisa called the decision 'a victory for those who want to tone down the reminder of the country's Christian traditions.' 
Shockingly, even though the onslaught of Islamic culture has wreaked havoc on Sweden's people and infrastructure, they want to 'tone down' the Christian influence. How backwards is that?! 
Authorities appear to be trying to sweep the decision under the rug by claiming it is a matter of 'safety.' 
'Poles are not designed for the weight of Christmas lights, and we have to remove anything that should not be there,' said Eilin Isaksson, national coordinator at the Swedish Transport Administration. 
I'm not sure they're going to be fooling anyone with this 'safety' line. If they were really so worried about that, they wouldn't be allowing millions of migrants to roam around raping their women and children. 
MRC Blog expressed the same sentiment: 
This argument that lights are too heavy and pose a safety risk is complete [sic] bogus, of course. Authorities in Sweden actually expect people to believe that lights normally held up by tree branches are now too weighty to be supported by metal poles. In reality, these lights have simply been banned to avoid offending Muslim 'refugees.' 
You can be sure that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we have a future similar to Sweden's to look forward to. She has privately expressed her desire for completely open borders and she kowtows to Muslims the same way President Obama does. 
SHARE this report if you think it is utterly absurd that Sweden has banned Christmas lights to appease Muslim refugees!

 You read that correctly. Here is the ugly truth that is sending Black Lives Matter leadership into orbit over Hillary's pandering hypocrisy! Eric Garner died a tragic, unexpected death at the hands of a police officer. His death has sometime's referred to as 'the chokehold death.' Video of the sad episode can be seen below: Eric Garner's daughter, Erica, is a prominent Black Lives Matter leader, and she is none to pleased at what WikiLeaks has brought to light. In discussing an upcoming statement to describe Hillary's stance on gun violence, Clinton staffer Nick Merrill wrote: 'Finally, I know we have Erica Garner issues but we don't want to mention Eric at all? I can see her coming after us for leaving him out of the piece.' Maya Harris replied, 'Eric Garner not included because not killed by gun violence.' The full email can be read here .

The revelation, understandably, has set off a firestorm in the Black Lives Matter community. Erica Garner is teeing off!

 Video after video does not lie. This footage, along with leaked emails, explains so much. SHE EVEN DRINKS TWO-FISTED! Stories of Hillary Clinton's affinity for alcohol have been around for years, and some of them, even in her own words, are legendary. Consider her vodka drinking contest with Senator John McCain. Here it is, told by none other than Democrat Presidential Nominee Hillary Clinton, in her own words and posted on her Facebook page: 
Then of course, there is the 'trip' Yemen. Watch her walk, her mannerisms, and her fall. Pay close attention: 
Our video study is just getting started, though now is a good time to mention the latest from WikiLeaks on the topic of Hillary's 'sobriety.' 
On August 8, 2015, Hillary's Campaign Chairman John Podesta wrote to Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri, 'Should I call her and talk this through or better to leave with you? I'm worried she'll get on with Cheryl and we'll end up in a bad place. I'm in a session that lasts till 3:30 your time. Is that timely or should I walk out?' 
Two hours later, Palmieria responded, 'I think you should call her and sober her up some.' 
It was 4:30pm, in the afternoon, and her staff is interested in sobering her up. 
Hillary's campaign staff are not the only one's to have noticed her drinking. 
Amy Chozick, a reporter for the New York Times, explained, 'She likes to drink. We were on the campaign trail in 2008 and the press thought she was just taking shots to pander to voters in Pennsylvania. Um, no.' 
In October of 2016, Chozick sent the following tweet: 
Makes sense, especially in light of campaign videos like this one:

Evidently, drinking is one of Hillary's political strategies. 
In a July 3 article, the New York Times reported that Hillary plans to 'seek common ground with the G.O.P. over drinks' in her first 100 days. 
It continued, 'Mrs. Clinton's ability to use alcohol as a political lubricant came up repeatedly when allies and advisers were asked how she might work with Republicans. Her tale about a drinking contest with Senator John McCain of Arizona is now a Washington legend. (She said they called it quits before things got out of hand.) She believes that a relaxed, frank discussion is more authentic than trying to bond awkwardly with adversaries over sports — and more productive than keeping them at arm's length, as Mr. Obama has often done. 
''She likes to cajole, she likes to make deals, and she likes to make friends,' said Richard Socarides, a former policy adviser to Bill Clinton and a longtime supporter of Mrs. Clinton. 'And she knows it's much harder to go after someone who you basically like, who you've had a drink with.'' 
One of Hillary's confidantes, Patti Solis Doyle, once remarked, 'She likes to hang out and drink and gossip.' Her drink of choice? Wine and vodka.

This is unbelievable! Donald Trump must be the next Nostradamus! One year ago, Donald Trump said something so profound that it is almost unbelievable. Take a look: #TRUMP was right again! 
— Trump Super PAC (@TrumpSuperPAC) October 28, 2016 
On August 29th, 2015, just after news broke that Huma Abedin's husband, Anthony Weiner, had been sexting young women, again, Trump said something that has turned out to be both profound and prophetic. 
'I only worry in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have close proximity to highly classified information.' 
He has also said: 
'Her No. 1 person, Huma Abedin, is married to Anthony Weiner, who's a sleazeball and pervert,' Trump said, referring to the former New York congressman's repeated scandals over lewd texts and direct Twitter messages he sent to other women. 'I'm not saying that, that's recorded history,' Trump continued. 'I don't like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets.' 
Trump intuitively knew that Hillary's top aide, Huma Abedin, was a massive liability. 
Now look at what just happened today! 
The New York Times reports: 
The FBI is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The Bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case – one federal official said they numbered in the thousands – potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the Presidential Campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the Election.' 
Let that sink in. 
The FBI had closed the Hillary Clinton email investigation, and now has reopened it after finding emails on Anthony Wieners devices as part of a sexting scandal and investigation. 
Trump was right about Huma and Wiener! 
There are other scandals that intersect with this one, as well. 
The pay-for-play questions that have been raised about the Clinton Foundation are in play, as Huma Abedin worked daily with the Clintons on countless issues. 
Is this the issue that will take Hillary down for good? 
Time will tell.

 Hillary has been caught in a NEW scandal and this one has FOREIGN implications as it involves trying to FIX a Palestinian election. Listen to how casually Hillary recommends 'determining' the winner in a Palestinian election when she thinks the conversation won't get out… …then imagine what she'd do to win this one? Unearthed tape: 'We should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win' The Observer reports : The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton's Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is 'rigged'! Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). 
' I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake, ' said Sen. Clinton. ' And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. ' Today The FBI has reopened their email investigation because Hillary keeps lying. Now this? All on the heels that WikiLeaks proved she is a drunk…HMMM I have this feeling that Hillary is somewhere drowning herself in a bottle of boos! She might want to go on a two week binge! This action is atrocious! To meddle in foreign elections is abominable and Hillary and Obama have both done so more than once. Insanity! I called Hillary for comment.

Just 11 days before the election, the FBI has re-opened its investigation into Hillary Clinton. According to The Political Insider , the news broke just as Donald Trump took the stage in New Hampshire, and it was the first thing heÂ mentioned.

— CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) October 28, 2016 
Here is Trump's full statement: 
I need to open with a very critical breaking news announcement.Â The FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new emails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's investigation.Â And they are re-opening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United Staes of America. 
Hillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made. This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood and it is everybody's hope that it is about to be corrected. 
So that is a big announcement that I heard ten minutes ago, and I guess obviously most of you folksÂ have heard about. And in all fairness, for all of the people that have suffered for doing so much less, including just recently 4-Star General James Cartwright, General Petraeus, and many others. Perhaps finally justice will be done. 
With that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech? We will talk about borders, right? We will talk about trade. We'll bring back our jobs, we'll strengthen our military…

A damning new political ad titled 'Can't Run Her House' has been released by the Defeat Crooked Hillary PAC, a subsidiary of the Make America Number 1 PAC. 
It features vintage footage of Michelle Obama from 2008, when her husband was campaigning against Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary. 
'One of the important aspects of this race is role-modeling what good families should look like. And my view is, if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House. You can't do it,' says the First Lady in reference to Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.

According to The Political Insider , the Clinton camp is so concerned over the release of the 8-year-old video clip that their lawyers are sending letters threatening to sue those who air it. 
On Monday, cease and desist letters were sent to WFLA-TV in Tampa, Cox Cable in Gainesville, Bright House Cable in Orlando, and WESH-TV in Orlando demanding that the stations stop airing the ad.

Hillary Clinton learned that the FBI had made the decision to reopen its investigation into her private email server while she was aboard a flight bound for Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 
As soon as her plane landed, she was met by a barrage of questions from eager reporters, but she chose not to address any of them, instead rushing off the plane and into a vehicle waiting for her.

 Actions of this magnitude from a are simply DEVASTATING! According to a late-night report, The White House is taking drastic action in light of the FBI's reopening of Hillary Clinton's email investigation. The Obama Administration has stated that they had not prior knowledge of the new investigation. It is also being reported that The Department of Justice was not notified, either. Some theorize that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is working to regain its reputation as an organization of integrity. By choosing not to inform The White House or The Department of Justice, the FBI could have been trying to prevent intervention from these two powerhouses. Now, the public knows that the investigation has been restarted, and it will be harder for pro-Hillary government organizations to play politics with the issue. The FBI's stunning news has caused The White House to take action, according to a recent report from Redflagnews . Late Friday night, all of Barack Obama's scheduled campaign appearances on behalf of Hillary Clinton were CANCELLED! Reportedly, all of the pre-planned events have been removed from the schedule (see below.) Given that President Obama's approval ratings are at an all-time high, a mass cancellation of this nature is certainly devastating to a Democrat Presidential hopeful like Hillary Clinton. For a popular, two-term President to distance himself from a Campaign, during the final ten days of the Election, is earth-shattering. Take a look at the following graphic: Will the Hillary Clinton Campaign have time to recover from these shocking revelations? Unfortunately, for Hillary, this may not be the last shoe to drop. Julian Assange of WikiLeaks has said that his next release will be the one that will definitely incriminate Hillary. Additionally, group like Anonymous are hinting that they also have blockbuster information to be released soon. Has the 'October Surprise' been replaced by the 'November Surprise?' It appears that Hillary Clinton is about to find out. Related Items

With just 10 days to go before the most important election of our lifetime, Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans are soaring in the polls. The Friday announcement that the FBI would be re-opening its investigation into Hillary Clinton's personal email server has not helped matters for Democrats, either. 
But none of this will matter if they are able to manipulate the vote. According to MRC Blog , that's why the left is going to drastic measures to drum up Democratic voters, expanding voting rights to include non-citizens in major cities nationwide. 
The latest notable city to do so is San Francisco, whose Election Day ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the city's public schools to vote in school board elections. Under this measure, people with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all would be allowed to vote. 
San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, who believes illegal aliens should be allowed to vote to bypass the 'broken immigration system in this country,' made the following statement: 
'One out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesn't have a voice. We've had legal immigrants who've had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.' 
Chiu is the son of Taiwanese immigrants. 
It is no secret that the vast majority of illegal aliens vote Democrat, because that is the party which is incessantly trying to buy their loyalty with an endless stream of handouts and promises of blanket amnesty. If it weren't so, we wouldn't see all of these liberals pushing so hard to give illegals voting rights; they simply do so because it works in their favor, not because it is actually good for anyone. 
Major cities from sea to shining sea are following San Francisco's lead, which is just one more very important reason to vote for Donald Trump on Nov. 8. We need to turn this country around and FAST!

It is DISTURBING to think that they have known about this FOR YEARS! Huma Abedin has worked as Hillary Clinton's top assistant for years. You are likely familiar with Huma, as she is a regular on the campaign trail with Hillary, and has also been in the news for years as the wife of Anthony Weiner, the embattled former Congressman who is perpetually accused of sexting improprieties. Reportedly, the FBI is reopening its investigation of Hillary's private email practices after finding evidence of Huma's involvement on one of Anthony Weiner's electronic devices. It is a small world, isn't it? Another Clinton employee, a name that you may not be familiar with, is popping up in the news lately for reasons that are startling, to say the least. Justin Cooper is an Information Technology worker who is reported to have set up Hillary's private email server. Recently, he even testified before a House Committee, saying that he extracted information from Clinton-related smart devices before 'smashing them to bits.' It is said that Cooper's testimony is the 'most informative we have heard yet.' Judge Andrew Napolitano has expressed concern over Cooper's access to this information, among other things, as Cooper did not hold a Security Clearance. 'He was an employee of the Clinton family and of the Clinton Foundation, and he had complete and total access to the Clinton emails, and he had no security clearance,' Judge Napolitano explained on 'Varney & Co.' today. Unfortunately, for Hillary and Huma, new, leaked information has come to light, and it has Justin Cooper's name all over it: Justin Cooper was the Clinton aide who set up the email server.Huma: "My clinton [black]berry not working"Cooper: "We were attacked again" pic.twitter.com/KjQcbocQzz

You read that correctly – 
Huma: 'My clinton [black]berry not working' 
Cooper: 'We were attacked again' 
So Huma and the Clinton Staff knew all along that they were being attacked, also known as 'hacked!' 
It is shocking to think that high level State Department employees knew, for years, about such vulnerabilities. 
Ironically, if it were not for hacking organizations like WikiLeaks, American voters still would not have this troubling knowledge.

Videos Hillary Clinton FBI PANIC! Hillary LIES In First Press Conference While A LEAKED PHOTO From Her Airplane Reveals The Truth 
 Hillary is trying to present a strong front but the truth continues to emerge, in VIDEO and in PHOTOS! Hillary was traveling to Iowa when news broke of the FBI's newly-reopened investigation of her email practices. Her plane sat on the tarmac for thirty minutes before she emerged, and, of course, the media was hungry for a statement. Last night, the press got their wish, as Hillary tried to appear strong in her first press conference following the bombshell news. Watch Hillary's statement below: 
Mostly, Hillary is echoing her Campaign Manager, John Podesta, who is calling for the release of more information from the FBI. 
Right out of the gate, Hillary is already lying in an attempt to minimize the damage that this new investigation is causing. 
She clearly states in the video above that the FBI sent the investigation announcement to Republicans in Congress. As a former Senator, Hillary knows this to be untrue, and she is trying to paint the issue as a partisan attack. Fact check: Contrary to what Clinton said, Comey sent letter to both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. @benyc 
— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) October 28, 2016 
Multiple media sources have reported that the FBI found new information while investigating the sexting scandal of former Congressman Anthony Weiner. Weiner is married to Hillary's top aide, Huma Abedin. When asked about the reports, Hillary responded: 
'You know, we've heard these rumors. We don't know what to believe and I'm sure there will be even more rumors that's why it's incumbent upon the FBI to tell us what they're talking about because, right now, your guess is as good as mine and I don't think that's good enough.' 
Hillary is trying to appear defiant and in control. But, speaking of Huma Abedin, take a look at this leaked photo from inside of Hillary's airplane after the news had broken: Image surfaces of Huma Abedin crying on plane as Clinton Campaign finds out the FBI has re-opened the email investigation. #HillarysEmails pic.twitter.com/2yIUgiYOsV 
We hate to see a lady crying, Huma, but when the company you keep includes Anthony Weiner, sometimes you have good reasons to cry. Perhaps Hillary's Campaign is not so strong after all. Related Items

Trevor Loudon has lived through the horrors of handing the reigns over to communist sympathizers in New Zealand. What is happening in the United States scares him. 
He points out that 100 Congressmen and 20 Senators could not qualify to obtain a basic security clearance to clean the toilets at any military base in the nation. Neither could Barack Obama. He discusses how many elected officials have close ties to Russia, China, Cuba and Venezuela and even Iran and North Korea.

An artificial intelligence (AI) system which correctly predicted the last three elections has put Donald Trump ahead of Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. 
The system is called MogIA, and it was founded in 2004 by Sanjiv Rai, the brains behind the Indian start-up Genic.ai. 
20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. are compiled and analyzed to come up with a prediction. 
It was also determined that enthusiasm for Trump is much higher than it was for Barack Obama in 2008. In fact, Trump has overtaken Obama's popularity that year by a whopping 25%. 
Rai's MogIA system has only gotten smarter since it was launched, and even correctly predicted the results of this year's Republican and Democratic primaries.

1 comment James Comey just outfoxed the entire corrupt establishment with one game changing technique… Hillary Clinton's Campaign called for the immediate release of all of the FBI's new findings. Congress is demanding more information from James Comey and the Bureau by Monday. President Obama and The Department Of Justice say that Comey did not notify them before sending his letter to Congress. The New York Times reported that Obama's Department Of Justice still has not granted approval for the FBI to review the emails that were allegedly found on Anthony Weiner's laptop. 'We do not have a warrant,' a senior law enforcement official said. 'Discussions are under way [between the FBI and the DOJ] as to the best way to move forward.' Could this be a brilliant, somewhat sneaky, move by Comey? The question has been raised: A serious journalist, of which there are few today, would wonder if this isn't precisely WHY Comey went public @thegarance @maggieNYT pic.twitter.com/kwFum9LNO7 
— DanRiehl (@DanRiehl) October 30, 2016 
The ball is now clearly in The Department of Justice's court. With both Hillary and Congress demanding the information now, the DOJ will have to issue the required warrant. Otherwise, Comey can claim to have done his job without fear of repercussions from the American public or the court system. 
It is true that Obama's DOJ has not investigated The Clinton Foundation and they discouraged Comey from looking into Hillary's email problems. Justice Dept. Strongly Discouraged Comey on Move in Clinton Email Case https://t.co/UjpRoz1OtC pic.twitter.com/WZXTn3DYqw

Comey just outran the angle. If Hillary and Congress are to get their answers, Obama's Justice Department will have to issue a warrant in order for them to get them. 
Other factors are in play, as well. With WikiLeaks and other groups looming, and the likelihood of more damaging information on the way, Comey may not want to go down with what he views as a massive, corrupt ship. 
Will Obama and the DOJ continue to stand behind Hillary? 
We will likely find out within the next WILD week. Related Items

Gee, the State Department and Hillary Clinton's campaign seem really cozy don't they? If I'm not mistaken, not only is this unethical, it's illegal. Last year, the State Department tipped off the Clinton campaign that a New York Times reporter was digging into her email scandal. The State Department had claimed that they had not worked to help Clinton during the whole corrupt mess. Guess what? They lied. 
Mike Schmidt is the reporter that broke the original story on the Hildabeast using a private email account and a home brewed server. They were keeping tabs on the guy and running to the Clinton campaign to report on what he was doing so they could head it off at the pass. That's called collusion. The State Department should go under immediate review and heads should roll over this. What blatant corruption. 
From The Daily Caller: 
The State Department tipped the Hillary Clinton campaign off last year that a New York Times reporter was asking questions about Clinton's emails. 
The revelation undermines the State Department's claims that it has not worked to help Clinton during the ongoing email scandal. 
'State just called to tell me that Mike Schmidt seems to have what appear to be summaries of some of the exchanges in the 300 emails the committee has,' Nick Merrill wrote in a March 14, 2015 email . 
Schmidt is the Times reporter who broke the news that Clinton used a private email account as secretary of state. The article was published on March 2, 2015. Clinton had turned more than 50,000 emails over to the State Department in Dec. 2014. The State Department then provided around 300 emails to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which was chaired by South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy. 
The emails seem to indicate that Clinton's team suspected Trey Gowdy of leaking the contents of Clinton's emails to Schmidt. 'Again, it appears that he does not have the email but that someone, likely from the committee, is slipping him cherry-picked characterizations of the exchanges,' Merrill wrote. 'I haven't heard directly from Schmidt yet but will circle back when I do.' Other Clinton campaign officials were not pleased with the news. In fact, they were pissed and went on a war footing over it. 
'This is no bueno,' communications director Jennifer Palmieri wrote. 'This is some kind of bullshit.' 'If Gowdy is doing selective leaks, we are in very different kind of warfare.' This exchange was of course exposed by WikiLeaks… man, the Hildabeast must really hate those guys. 
And it gets even worse. Another email sent days before Schmidt published his first bombshell report on the Clinton emails, shows that Democrats on the Benghazi Committee also tipped off the Democrat's team that the reporter was snooping around. There's not a damned one of these Democrats that have any honor. Not one. 'Talked to [Clinton attorney Heather Samuelson] late afternoon aand [sic] told her I'd heard from Dem Staff Director on Benghazi Select Comm that NYT was sniffing around, maybe to do a story on State production to Committee or on our production to State,' Clinton lawyer David Kendall wrote on Feb. 28th, 2015. 
'I'd gotten a call from NYT's Mike Schmidt (very young) about 2:00 pm–said nothing on background or on record. I didn't feel he had anything, but. We may get a further inquiry from him over weekend.' This indicates to me that these idiots had no idea how big the NYT's story would be. 
Kendall also wrote that Schmidt attempted to get him to hand over copies of Clinton's emails that had already been produced for the Benghazi Committee. 'He knew that some of the HRC dox had been produced — wasn't sure if they all had been. He knew that State had asked other former SOS's for their emails but didn't know what the response was. I couldn't tell what his likely angle was (and even if he had one),' Kendall wrote. 
This isn't the first time there has been dirty dealings between the State Department and other government agencies with Team Clinton. It surely won't be the last. Our government definitely needs an enema. Related Items Terresa Monroe-Hamilton

The FBI found something, but no one had any idea it would be THIS BIG! Huma Abedin clearly never knew what Anthony Weiner had been up to on his electronic devices. That, perhaps, is the understatement of 2016. Allegedly, he was sexting countless women, some of them underage. Some of the pictures that he sent to other women were selfies that revealed his family life. The revelations are disturbing and merit investigations of their own. Given the bizarre nature of Anthony Weiner's digital habits, who would have ever dreamed that the 2016 Presidential Election would be rocked by the far out notion of critical governmental information on a pervert's device. No wonder Huma was seen crying on Hillary's airplane. Huma Abedin, reportedly, says that she has no idea how the emails ended up on her estranged husband's devices. Could Huma, and her boss, Hillary, be setting Anthony Weiner as a scapegoat? It sounds like something they might do. Perhaps more shocking is the massive amount of emails found on Weiner's laptop. According to The Washington Post, FIVE DIGITS worth of emails are being researched. That indicates a minimum of 10,000 messages that could implicate Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton, and their new best friend, Anthony Weiner. Oddly enough, Abedin was not a regular user of the device in question. Perhaps the messages were moved there as part of a backup process? Maybe Huma did not have her device family sharing settings configured properly. At this time, Officials do not believe that any of the messages are duplicates. The FBI will certainly use programs designed to 'dedup' or weed out duplicates. Any email messages that remain will be examined to determine criminality. Is this new investigation enough to bring down the person who many believe is on course to be the first female President of the United States of America? The irony of a female Presidential candidate being investigated because of a pervert male former Congressman is not lost on me.

This is just too rich! The FBI agreed to destroy the laptops that Clinton and her aides turned over during the EmailGate investigation… and then agents REFUSED to do it. Now, the laptops have been subpoenaed and the FBI is just waiting for Congress to ask for them. Oh goody! All that evidence is about to come back into play along with Weiner's laptop that has over 10,000 emails of Huma's dealings with Hillary Clinton. Good times. Stick a fork in them… I'd say they may just be about done. 
Washington D.C. attorney Joe DiGenova is the one that broke this explosive revelation. Hillary Clinton must be having multiple panic attacks right about now. I guess we are going to see just how well her health holds up over her corruption being exposed. I understand that she looks dead tired over all this. I'll bet. Her lies are finally beginning to catch up with her. They should have long ago. 
From The Daily Caller: 
Agents within the Federal Bureau of Investigation never destroyed laptops given to them by aides of Hillary Clinton as previously reported , a Washington D.C. lawyer with a source close to the Clinton investigation says. 
Washington D.C. attorney Joe DiGenova said on The David Webb Show on SiriusXM Friday night that despite the FBI agreeing to destroy the laptops of Clinton aide Cheryl Mills and ex-campaign staffer Heather Samuelson as part of immunity deals made during the initial investigation of Clinton's email server, agents involved in the case refused to destroy the laptops. 
'According to the agreement reached with the attorneys who handed over their laptops, the laptops were to be destroyed per the agreement after the testimony was given –the interviews were given – – by the attorneys. The bureau and the department agreed to that,' DiGenova said. 'However the laptops contrary to published reports were not destroyed and the reason is the agents who are tasked with destroying them refused to do so. And by the way the laptops are at the FBI for inspection by Congress or federal courts.' 
DiGenova said the laptops have already been subpoenaed and the FBI is waiting for Congress to ask for them. 
I'm sure Donald Trump is all smiles over these developments. In the end, Hillary Clinton was her own worst enemy and Donald Trump's biggest supporter in this election. 
'When I found out last Sunday that those laptops — by the way from somebody who is involved in the investigation by the FBI– had not been destroyed contrary to published reports, I could not believe that the Republicans had not gotten their hands on them even yet,' DiGenova said. Neither can I… come on GOP… you've just been handed the keys to the kingdom here. Time to go in for the kill. Don't blow it this time. Related Items Terresa Monroe-Hamilton

James Comey went from being the darling of the left, to their arch nemesis in an instant. When the four devices, including a laptop, were seized in the Anthony Weiner sexting case, over 10,000 of Huma Abedin's State Department emails were discovered. First off, Comey had a duty to disclose those emails. Second, as far as redemptive opportunities go, this one is golden. Comey gets a chance to do the right thing and remove some of that tarnish from his name and from the FBI. 
Now, Congress is considering holding an emergency hearing this next Friday… just four days before the general election. It's unprecedented and you can bet the Democrats will try to stall. Comey will star at the hearing and the fact that the Department of Justice is either stalling or just refusing to issue a warrant for those emails is telling. That won't hold up forever… eventually, a federal judge will step in if the DOJ insists on flaunting more corruption. But timing is everything here. Almost assuredly those laptops that the FBI supposedly destroyed, but didn't, will come up as well. 
From Western Journalism : 
Both parties in Congress jockeyed for position Saturday in the wake of the dramatic bombshell delivered by the FBI on Friday regarding new evidence that has led the FBI to breathe new life into its investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintonâs use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. 
Republicans sought to move the issue to the front burner in the week before Election Day, while Democrats castigated the FBI for announcing its probe. 
One report claimed House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, was considering holding a hearing Friday to grill Comey about the most current evidence and investigation. 
Congress is currently on its usual pre-election recess. 
The possibility of a pre-election hearing or briefing was also raised by Sen. Ron Johnson , R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. 
If the hearing happens (and I pray it does), there will be fireworks all the way into election day and beyond. There's a really good chance now that Trump may win because of all this. If Clinton wins, this scandal will follow her into the White House as will impeachment proceedings and an indictment. We could wind up with her resigning almost immediately and Tim Kaine becoming president. Shudder. 
I doubt that House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz is going to let this slide. He'll be a bull dog on it and he'll get his hearing this next Friday probably. Both Clinton and Abedin are going to go down over this. I don't think Congress has ever faced an emergency quite like this one in our lifetime. Related Items Terresa Monroe-Hamilton

Anthony Weiner (aka Carlos Danger) and his Pandora's email box may just do in Huma Abedin AND Hillary Clinton. It just gets wackier and wackier by the minute. Huma testified that she turned over ALL devices that had State Department information and communications on them. Not so much. One wonders how 10's of thousands of her emails got on Weiner's laptop. Did she put them there or did he get copies of them for some sleazy reason? As DC churns, the soap opera continues. 
It definitely looks like Huma Abedin lied… in fact, perjured herself. Currently, Huma is nowhere to be found. Word has it she is holed up at home and Clinton is distancing herself from her. Hey Hildabeast… that's not going to save your skanky behind. This time, you don't have plausible deniability because you and Abedin were literally joined at the hip. Her crimes are your crimes. What's worse, remember those pesky laptops that the FBI said they destroyed? Nope, they lied and kept them. Panicking now would be good guys. 
From The Daily Beast : 
…the new information that the FBI found State Department-related email on her home laptop also calls into question whether Abedin in fact turned over all of the devices she used to send and receive email while working at State. 
On June 28, 2016, Abedin said under oath in a sworn deposition that she looked for all devices that she thought contained government work on them so the records could be given to the State Department. (These records were subsequently reviewed by the FBI.) 
'How did you go about searching for what records you may have in your possession to be returned to the State Department?' Attorney Ramona Cotca for Judicial Watch asked her. 
'I looked for all the devices that may have any of my State Department work on it and returned — returned — gave them to my attorneys for them to review for all relevant documents. And gave them devices and paper,' Abedin answered. 
That's definitely a problemo for the Clinton campaign. Now, Huma is claiming she has no idea how all those emails got on that laptop. She's using the Schultz defense: 'I know nothing!' And all of this was uncovered when Weiner couldn't keep his Johnson where it belonged. He's being investigated for approaching a 15 year-old girl in a sexting sting by the FBI. Four devices were seized in that case and surprise, surprise, surprise! Lookie what they found. Since the email scandal case was not officially closed yet, they had to reveal additional evidence found. Plus, those laptops that weren't destroyed (oops!) are now being investigated. Not good for the Clinton camp. 
A source told Fox News that there were over 10,000 emails of Huma's on Weiner's laptop… and they were 'pertinent' to the email investigation. It sounds to me as if Huma kept a copy of everything just in case, if you get my drift. The only thing holding up the crap from hitting the fan is the DOJ is refusing to give a warrant to the FBI for the laptop. But at some point either they will have to or a federal judge will stop in. Timing is everything here. 
Huma won't be able to play dumb or lie her way out of this one and I suspect Hillary knows that. The question is, will she implode before or after the election? Related Items Terresa Monroe-Hamilton

Did Anthony Weiner say these things as part a deal to save himself? Anthony Weiner has spoken! One year ago, we all that that Donald Trump was just being funny, just being Trump, when he said that Hillary Clinton was showing poor judgement in letting Huma Abedin, wife of 'perf sleaze' Anthony Weiner have access to government information. Trump called the couple a security risk, but again, we thought he was just making fun of them. As it turns out, Donald Trump's words were eerily prophetic. Unless you have been hiding under a rock, you have heard by now that the FBI is reopening the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email problems after finding evidence on devices at Anthony Weiner's home. Earlier, we reported that FBI Director James Comey had tricked Obama's Department of Justice and the Clintons in sending the investigation announcement letter to Congress. Some believe that Comey was attempting to force the DOJ to issue a warrant so that his agents can start reading the 10,000+ emails on Weiner's device. 
Here Is How FBI Director Comey BAMBOOZLED The DOJ, CONGRESS, And The CLINTONS All At Once

In essence, Weiner is singing like a bird, and the FBI can conduct a thorough review of the emails in question. If there is criminality found on Weiner's devices, they have a shot at it. 
Is there anything that the Department of Justice or the Clintons can do? 
Time will tell, but many believe that WikiLeaks and others are about to drop more incriminating evidence on Hillary later this week. 
Comey may have saved himself. Weiner may be trying to cut a plea deal to save himself.

 He and Huma Abedin interned for the Clintons and rose to power. Now WikiLeaks has exposed the truth about all of them… At age 22, Doug Band started interning for President William Jefferson Clinton. Later, he earned a law degree, and became Bill Clinton's top assistant. He is Bill Clinton's version of Huma Abedin, and the connections between Band and Abedin are also tightly woven in to the fabric of the Clinton story. He became a talented negotiator. According to the bio on his company website (Teneo,) Doug Band was 'part of the negotiation team that handled all aspects of Hillary Clinton's becoming secretary of state.' Prior to that, in 2005, Band himself conceived the idea of the Clinton Global Initiative. The money flowed in like a tidal wave. In a scandal that has been brewing for more than a decade now, it is said that Doug Band 'shook down' countless donors. The pitch was simple: give to the Clinton Global Initiative/The Clinton Foundation, and reap the benefits of Bill and Hillary Clinton's influence. The pitch worked. In a memo entitled, 'Leveraging Teneo For The Foundation,' Doug Band listed millions of dollars in donations that he solicited for The Clinton Foundation. He also listed moneys for speaking engagements: It appears that the deals listed above were only the beginning. ZeroHedge reports: 
Further, the head of Teneo also offered the following commentary on the '$50 million in for-profit activity' he was able to secure for Bill Clinton (as of November 2011) as well as the '$66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements.' 
In effect, what Band was doing, as the NYT's Nick Confessore summarized , ' was selling his clients on idea that giving to foundation was, in essence, a way to bolster their influence. Clinton & Band built a platform for executives to bolster their companies' images, bathe in BC's praise, and do some good, while Teneo extracted earnings for Band and, depending on what you see in these e-mails, Clinton himself. Teneo paid Clinton until late '11. ' 
As Confessore also pointed out, 'I guess you can wave it all off as a nothingburger. But Chelsea Clinton and some of Clinton's other aides were clearly freaking out.' 
And he concluded by saying 'Generally, the emails show Clinton's *own closest aides* troubled or horrified by things that her surrogates have spent years waving off. ' 
The entire operation was money-making, and extremely suspicious. 
It is no wonder that Band wrote the following in a 2011 email to Cheryl Mills and John Podesta. Via WikiLeaks: 
Need get this asap to them although I'm sure cvc (Chelsea Clinton) won't believe it to be true bc she doesn't want to Even though the facts speak for themselves. John, I would appreciate your feedback and any suggestions 
I'm also starting to worry that if this story gets out, we are screwed. Dk and I built a business. 65 people work for us who have wives and husbands and kids, they all depend on us. Our business has almost nothing to do with the clintons, the foundation or cgi in any way. The chairman of ubs could care a less about cgi. Our fund clients who we do restructuring and m and a advising the same just as bhp nor tivo do. These are real companies who we provide real advice to through very serious people. Comm head for goldman, dep press secretary to bloomberg, former head of banking, and his team, from morgan stanley for asia and latin am. I realize it is difficult to confront and reason with her but this could go to far and then we all will have a real serious set of other problems. I don't deserve this from her and deserve a tad more respect or at least a direct dialogue for me to explain these things. She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she's doing because she, as she has said, hasn't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life. I realize she will be off of this soon but if it doesn't come soon enough…. 
In light of the recent events surrounding the FBI's renewed investigation and Anthony Weiner's involvement, it is hard to predict the amount of attention Doug Band's story will get. 
On the other hand, many of these issues are tied together so tightly that that all could come crashing down at once. 
With WikiLeaks and others preparing to release more information, next week could be a crazy one!

 If you think Anthony Weiner's perverted antics were bad, wait until you see this! They have been together for decades, and while the truth has trickled out, technology has opened the floodgates. Enter Anonymous. The hard-to-define hacking group is doubted by many though they often get things exactly right. Their ideas about Huma Abedin, Hillary's top assistant, have enough merit to be worth a look, though what you see may frighten you. Allegedly, Huma has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, as her mother is a member of the Brotherhood's female counterpart. No question, she is tied to Saudi Arabia, as she was raised there. She was born in the United States, and at age two, her family moved to Saudi. Huma returned at age 18, then started her intern career with Hillary Clinton at the age of twenty. She worked for her mother's magazine, a Jihadist publication that promotes Sharia law. The Muslim World League funds the Abedin family business, and they also funded al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. Who is Human Abedin, in truth? The video below from Anonymous reveals more: 
With news of Huma's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, dominating the news recently, much is being presented in the news media on Weiner and Abedin's connection to Hillary Clinton, with the ongoing FBI investigation being primary. 
As you may expect, Anonymous, as a group, joins WikiLeaks in their desire to expose the corruption of Hillary Clinton. Conflicts of interest, political scandals, money laundering, pay-for-play on an international scale, and more are the focus on Anonymous. 
The amount of information that is available on Hillary Clinton is intimidating, as her career has run for decades. 
Take a look at the video below, also from Anonymous, and consider how she and Huma Abedin have found themselves in their current set of controversial circumstances.

A newly leaked email from Hillary Clinton's Campaign Manager John Podesta is titled 'Hillary actions / unpleasant odor.' 
'People tell me that Hillary is acting 'like a retard' since her head injury,' wrote Podesta on March 22, 2015. 'Frankly, considering her normal behavior, I'm surprised anyone noticed! (this is a joke!) Have someone talk to her doctor and see if there's anything he can give her.' 
'Also, I've noticed she's had an 'odor' lately,' he continued. 'It reminds me of a combination of boiled cabbage, urine and farts. I'm guessing it's either connected to her fall or simply the fact that she rarely bathes.' 
'Outside of encouraging her to take a shower once in a while, I don't know what to do about this. — any suggestions would be appreciated.' 
Well, apparently, Hillary Clinton is just as gross as we all thought!

Hillary Clinton's trouble staying sober has been just one of the many scandals she has faced this election season, and a newly-surfaced video isn't going to help her reputation for being a complete lush. 
The footage was captured and shared by New Jersey Senator Cory Booker ahead of a June 1st rally in Newark, New Jersey, where Clinton appeared with rock musician Jon Bon Jovi. 
In the short clip, the Democratic nominee appears unusually jovial, singing and dancing for no apparent reason, as if she had just had a few drinks in the middle of the day.

According to WikiLeaks emails published Monday, Hillary Clinton's staff knew that Anthony Weiner was messaging an underage girl as far back as 2011, yet did nothing about it. The protection of young women isn't high on the list of priorities when you work for the Democratic nominee. 
RedStateWatcher reported that the email detailed lurid claims of private messages to an underage girl being investigated by police – and was met with the response 'oof' by Clinton campaign manager John Podesta. 
'Police on Friday afternoon came to the home of a 17-year-old high school junior to ask her about direct online communications she has had with Rep. Anthony Weiner,' the email read. 
'Two officers from the New Castle County Police Department arrived at the girl's home around 4:30 p.m. and asked to speak with the girl's mother about the daughter's contact with Weiner. Another officer appeared at the home a short time later.' 
Weiner is married to Huma Abedin, Hillary's top aide. 
In June of 2011, an investigation was launched into his online contact with a 17-year-old Delaware high school student. Since then, the disgraced former Congressman hasn't been able to kick the habit. (Most recently, he was caught sending suggestive photos of himself to a mistress. His son was asleep in the background of one infamous shot.) 
Abedin herself is now at the center of a fresh FBI investigation into the handling of classified material while Clinton was in office.

 Obama was speaking to donors at a private fundraiser in California when he railed against former House Oversight Committee Chair Darrell Issa for calling his administration corrupt. 
'Here's a guy who called my administration perhaps the most corrupt in history — despite the fact that actually we have not had a major scandal in my administration,' Obama said! 
Obama has had more scandals than any president in history! Just because the MSM refuses to report on them does not mean they do not exist! 
Breitbart reports : 
Issa was the key figure in several investigations of the Obama administration, including the Fast and Furious debacle with Attorney General Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton's failure in Benghazi, the failures in the Veterans Affairs department, and the IRS using its power to target conservative Tea Party groups for investigations. 
Obama accused Issa of wasting taxpayer money 'on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere.' 
'This guy has spent all his time simply trying to obstruct, to feed the same sentiments that resulted in Donald Trump becoming their nominee,' Obama said. 
We could list 77 scandals, but here are just 7 of the biggest! 
1.) IRS Targeting Scandal 
In 2013, Lois Lerner, former director of the IRS Exempt Organizations division, admitted that officials in the IRS' Cincinnati office acted improperly. 2.) VA Waiting List 
The Department of Veterans Affairs inspector general first noted the waiting list problem at a Phoenix clinic in 2014 and then found other clinics with similar problems. Veterans were placed on phony waiting lists, and some even died while waiting for care. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned from his position. 3.) GSA Spending Spree 
In 2012, Martha N. Johnson, the administrator of the General Services Administration, resigned after the federal procurement agency was engulfed in a controversy. The department was accused of allowing excessive spending on travel and conferences for the agency and employees. 4.) Attack on the Benghazi Compound 
On Sept. 11, 2012, weeks before a presidential election, terrorists attacked U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, Libya. Obama administration officials initially blamed this attack on a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim YouTube video that spun out of control. 5.) Clinton Emails 
It was the Benghazi committee that first discovered that before, during, and after her time as secretary of state, Clinton maintained a private email server. This prompted the FBI to investigate questions of whether Clinton violated the law in terms of storing classified information. 6.) Fast and Furious Gun Walking 
Operation Fast and Furious was a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives program, meant to be a sting operation. It allowed about 2,000 guns to flow to Mexican drug trafficking organizations under federal supervision before authorities lost control of the guns. 7.) Solyndra Subsidies 
The Energy Department provided a $535 million loan guarantee to the politically connected solar panel firm Solyndra as part of the 2009 stimulus bill. Not long after building its factory, the California firm filed for bankruptcy protection and an FBI investigation ensued. The company did not find a buyer and eventually closed down. So Barack Obama…just shut up!

 Is she a loyal wife and patriot or traitorous spy? Hackers exposed her secrets then her husband's sex scandal opened the floodgates… Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton's top assistant for years, has perhaps become the most significantÂ figure in the final weeks of the 2016 Election. Born in the United States, Abedin's family moved to Saudi Arabia when she was two. At age 18, she returned to the United States, and, in 1996, at age 20, started interning for Hillary Clinton. From 2002-2008, she also worked for her mother's radical Muslim magazine, the Journal for Muslim Minority Affairs. Reportedly, the Journal advocates Sharia law and denounces the right of women. Through WikiLeaks, we recently learned just how close Huma was to Hillary.

Clearly, Huma knew that they had been hacked in the past, yet she never once reported the possible vulnerabilities to National Security? 
Today, we learned that the New York Police Department, while investigating the sexting scandal of Huma's estranged husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner, uncovered a digital folder entitled, âLife Insurance.â Multiple news sources have reported that the folder contains 650,000 official emails from Huma and Hillary's time at the State Department. 
Did Huma create the âLife Insuranceâ folder to use as leverage, just in case her boss, Hillary Clinton, ever turned on her? Or, did Anthony Weiner create the folder, for his own bargaining options? So did Huma steal 10,000 emails and saved it on her comp just in case Clinton targeted her? 
Hence: 'life insurance'

On Sunday night, just days after the FBI officially re-opened their criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton, someone played with Google's search algorithm, according to The Political Insider . 
If you searched 'pathological liar,' a picture of Hillary Clinton appeared next to the definition of the term. 
'It is a stand-alone disorder as well as a symptom of other disorders such as psychopathy and antisocial, narcissistic, and historic personality disorders, but people who are pathological liars may not possess characteristics of the other disorders,' read the definition to the left of Clinton's headshot. 
'Excessive lying is a common symptom of several mental disorders.'

 It is meant to be fun, but this video actually reveals quite a bit about 50 BMG ballistics. Surprisingly, the Internet is blowing up about our hero's political hat, as well. Happy Halloween! The .50 Browning Machine Gun, or 50 BMG, is simply terrifying. The 12/7 X 99 MM NATO cartridge was developed in the late 1910's, and has been manufactured in a number of variants: regular ball, armor piercing, tracer, incendiary, or even saboted sub-caliber rounds. Some rifles, like the one in this video, use magazines, while machine guns often use metallic links. The round is based on a scaled-up .30-06 cartridge and the ballistics are completely insane! Snipers can fire at long ranges, more than a mile away, and avoid contact with the enemy by changing positions on retreating before they are discovered. Modern 50 BMG rounds can produce between 10,000 and 15,000 foot pounds of energy while suffering from less drift from cross-winds than smaller, lighter projectiles. Originally, John Browning intended for this round to be used in World War I anti-aircraft weapons. Armor-piercing incendiary variants were proven to be effective not only against aircraft, but also structures, concrete bunkers, and some armored vehicles. There are a number of military and law enforcement applications for the 50 BMG round. The US Coast Guard uses it to disable boat engines, often firing from a helicopter. Similarly, police departments use the round to disable vehicles by firing it into the engine block. As mentioned earlier, military snipers have used the round for some time, with Marine Carlos Hathcock recording a successful shot at 2,286 yards! The longest confirmed kill with a 50 BMG has been credited to Canadian Army Corporal Rob Furlong, who shot a combatant in Afghanistan at 2,657 yards in 2002. So, the 50 BMG is effective in a number of ways. Many consider it to be effective at creating massive amounts of fun. No doubt, firing this awesome round through a big pile of pumpkins qualifies. Enjoy, and Happy Halloween!

During his final few months in the Senate, senile old Harry Reid has saved his most insane accusation for last. 
He is accusing the FBI Director of treason due to his announcement that the department is searching additional documents that could provide information related to the Hillary Clinton email probe. 
What a loony. 
In a last ditch effort to save dirty Clinton, Reid accused the FBI chief of violating the Hatch Act, in other words, acting with political motives as a government official. Reid concluded that the FBI director violated this act by sending his letter to Congress days before Election Day. 
Reid stated that according to CBS News ,'Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another,' Then he added that that through Comey's 'partisan actions, you may have broken the law.' Harry Reid: FBI Director Comey's 'Partisan Actions' May Violate Federal Law – Letter: pic.twitter.com/agXy4D1igh 
— Ryan Ruggiero (@RyanRuggiero) October 30, 2016 
Violations of the Hatch Act are a serious offense (you might recall this, because numerous Obama Administration officials have been accused of violating the federal law with zero action taken against them. 
'[Y]our highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group,' Reid wrote. 
In providing examples of what he claims are a violation of the Hatch Act, Reid pointed to the 'selective approach:' Comey's refusal to of investigate Trump and his possible campaign ties to the Russian government. 
'In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government – a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity,' he said. 'I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public… and yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information.' 
'You're rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton,' he said. 
The Hatch Act is a federal law that was passed in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to limit federal agencies or its employees from interfering with political activities or federally funded programs. 
This means federal employees can't hold fund-raisers for politicians or receive donations, but they can vote for or against candidates running in an election, the law states. 
Reid ended the letter reminding the director that he used to be a supporter of Comey's – even when Republicans filibustered his nomination as FBI chief: 'I led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant,' Reid concluded. 'With the deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong.' 
In all actuality, Comey told Congress that even though he wasn't 'closing the case' in the FBI probe of Hillary's emails, he was still ending the investigation. 
Ironically can you imagine if he hadn't sent the letter? With the recent revelations, had he not sent a letter to Congress, he would have been blamed for attempting to lie to Congress and cover-up further investigation. As it stands, by sending the letter, he is simply accused of partisanship by sending the letter. 
I'd say he's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. 
I little suspicion that Comey has a backbone MUCH stronger than Harry Reid or any of his spineless Democratic accusers now. 
What an act of desperation on the Democrats part. Hillary is doing nothing but grasping at straws, whether or not anything comes of this new investigation before the election, we'll see, but to actually accuse Comey of treason, is utter idiocy. Related Items

With just days to go until the election, the Democrats are trying to salvage what little remains of Hillary Clinton's reputation. Time Magazine is now trying to defend the left-wing candidate with a last resort–using the sexism card. 
As we get closer to Election Day, the left seems to be running out of excuses for their floundering candidate. Left-wing heads are on the verge of exploding. Not unlike the Galaxy S7. So, in Time Magazine's latest attempt to play off Hillary Clinton's FBI investigation , they're digging deep and pulling out… the sexism card ?! 
I am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. It's us. 
No it isn't. Emailgate, or my preferred term 'Dikileaks' is about a candidate mishandling confidential email. A flagrant abuse of the law and our national security. Also, Hillary Clinton doesn't represent all women. But nice try, dummy. 1 
The only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man? Clinton is guilty of SWF (Speaking While Female), and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what she's doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around. 
Actually yes, we can imagine this happening to a man. Men cannot hide behind their vagina, or Time readers' stupidity. Which means they're usually punished. See also General Petraeus . Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is running for President. She might even win. While under FBI investigation. So 'muh sexism' charges are lazy. And insulting to anyone who has three brain cells (like the writer of the Time article). 
The people are demanding Clinton act like moral exemplars, thundering from the pulpit like Jonathan Edwards or Cotton Mather. But Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Rush Limbaugh and their many conservative friends are not remotely Clinton's moral superiors. They are simply bullies, using gender discrimination to give a veneer of plausibility to their accusations. 
'Moral exemplars'? 'Thundering from the pulpit'? No, Time Magazine feminist shill, Robin Lakoff. People are demanding Hillary Clinton not be a criminal liar. Not really that much to ask of someone who wants to lead the country. 
Trump and the other men on Time Magazine's list haven't done anything illegal. That's the difference, not their sex organs. Not their fashion choices. Evidence is piling up against Hillary more and more each day. Even the mainstream media is turning against her . Which means pantsuits or regular suits enter not into the Hillary is a Criminal equation. Her investigation isn't about sexism. It's about Hillary breaking the law. 
But desperate Time calls for predictable, desperate measures: SEXISM! Just as any criticism of Obama was deemed RACISM. 
Leftists are running out of defenses for the pantsuited devil-spawn. So they resort to old hat tactics. Just like they do when they say Wikileaks is the product of Russian hackers. 
If we had a brick for every Clinton scandal and misdeed, the wall wouldn't cost a cent. There's nothing sexist about holding someone, male or female, accountable for their actions. In fact, it's kind of the opposite. It would be sexist NOT to hold Hillary to the same standards as all the boys. This is absolutely ridiculous. It's not that we are against having a woman for president. We're just against that woman being Hillary because she is corrupt and a pathological liar. Related Items

On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania State Police raided a Delaware County political field office for the Democratic Party in search of 'templates utilized to construct fraudulent voter registration forms,' and 'completed voter registration forms containing same or similar identifying information of individuals on multiple forms.' 
A warrant was filed last week in County Court seeking the documents tied to voter fraud. Investigators said they were looking for the documents, financial information, and lists of employees at the Norwood office of FieldWorks LLC, a national organization that often does street work for Democrats. 
Matt Dorf, a spokesman for FieldWorks' national headquarters in Washington, released the following statement: 
'FieldWorks is now working with county officials to provide them with information on our program and applications they are investigating. In keeping with our regular practice, we will work aggressively with authorities to seek the prosecution of anyone involved in wrongdoing.' 
Founded in 2001, according to promotional material online, FieldWorks describes itself as 'a nationally recognized grassroots organizing firm founded to help progressive organizations, advocacy groups, and members of the Democratic family take their public engagement and electoral strategies to the next level.' 
In 2012, FieldWorks' voter registration efforts in Ohio sparked some controversy when the organization's employees filed thousands of new voter registration cards in the final week before the registration deadline and some of them were found to be fraudulent.

 Can this really be happening? Michelle Obama has been campaigning for Hillary Clinton for some time. She touts Hillary's accomplishments while denouncing Donald Trump as a misogynist and all-around scumbag. Just five days ago, the First Lady Of The United States and Hillary Clinton appeared together on stage in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. They held hands, they worked the crowd. Michelle presented a rousing statement: âThere are some folks out there who are commenting that it is unprecedented for a sitting first lady to be so actively engaged in a presidential campaign, and that may be true,â said Mrs. Obama, a reluctant campaigner who has nevertheless emerged in recent weeks as Mrs. Clintonâs most compelling surrogate. âBut what is also true is that this is truly an unprecedented election, and thatâs why Iâm out here,â Mrs. Obama added, arguing that Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, was working to discourage people in the crowd from voting by making âthis election so dirty and ugly that we donât want any part of it.â What a difference a few days makes. Only a few moments ago, Michelle Obama made an earth shattering move on Twitter. Multiple outlets are reporting that Michelle deleted all references of Hillary from her Twitter feed, and all Tweets from the last three years.

In case you didn't already know the glaringly obvious, MSNBC is widely considered to be one of the most liberal cable news channels of all the mainstream media. Now, in a stunning segment on his show, MSNBC host Chris Matthews basically endorses Donald Trump. Hillary must be feeling pretty crappy about herself because this latest scandal appears to have been pushed Matthews onto the Trump train. A liberal. That's sad Hillary. 
Matthews reviews a string of Obama's failures, then goes on to say that if you like them, vote for Hillary. If you want to change those failures, the only option is to vote for Trump. This is HUGE! 
You know you are on the losing end when staunch Democrats even hate you. 
He even stated that we have the chance to change the status quo unless we've become too 'dainty' to do that. I seriously can't believe I heard that from Chris Matthews on MSNBC! Related Items

 In many ways, this SCANDALOUS investigation is more DISTURBING than the others… It is hard to imagine an investigation more scandalous than the one presented my sexting wild man Anthony Weiner and his beautiful, estranged wife, Huma Abedin. Depending on what is found on the 650,000 emails on Weiner and Abedin's laptop, the infamous couple could take down one of the most powerful women on the planet, Hillary Clinton. Something tells me that there is plenty of scandal to go around, however. It is now being reported that the FBI's Miami office is investigating the Clinton Foundation for their 'work' in Haiti. . @rpollockDC reports that FBI's Miami office is conducting Clinton Fnd probe concerning Haiti work. https://t.co/w8iPeQ69nr @dailycaller 
— Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) October 31, 2016 
It is no surprise that the FBI is interested in the Clinton's dealings in Haiti. 
Since January of 2015, when a group of Haitians surrounded the Clinton Foundation's offices in New York, carrying signs that said, 'Clinton, where's the money?' 
Dhoud Andre, of the Commission Against Dictatorship, has said, 'We are telling the world of the crimes that Bill and Hillary Clinton are responsible for in Haiti.' 
Recent emails, leaked from the State Department, indicated that contractors seeking to provide earthquake relief to devastated Haitians were heavily vetted by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's team. The criteria? Contractors needed to be 'FOB's,' or 'Friends of Bill.' These FOB's were donors to the Clinton Foundation. Reportedly, if a contract company was not a donor, they were referred elsewhere, while donating contractors were given funds to work in Haiti. 
Almost $4 billion was sent to Haiti for relief, and it has been noted by some Haitians that little of this money actually made it to those who need it. 
Haitians also have noted that Bill Clinton was the designated UN Representative for aid to Haiti while Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State. 
The Clintons were the two most powerful people controlling the funds meant to help Haitians. 
Contracts went to friends of the Clintons, and, reportedly, homes were not built, schools were not built, technology was not installed, and infrastructure was not significantly improved. 
Haiti did, however, gain a few million dollar hotels. 
Not exactly what the poor were hoping for. 
Take a look at this video, entitled 'How the Clinton Foundation Got Rich Off Poor Haitians.' 
The details are almost too numerous to list. For more information, visit the National Review. 
One thing is certain, if the FBI continues at this pace, the details are forthcoming, and they are not likely to be pretty.

According to ClashDaily , newly leaked email from Hillary Clinton's Campaign Manager John Podesta is titled 'Hillary actions / unpleasant odor.' Many are claiming this is a hoax. Sure sounds like one. 
'People tell me that Hillary is acting 'like a retard' since her head injury,' wrote Podesta on March 22, 2015. 'Frankly, considering her normal behavior, I'm surprised anyone noticed! (this is a joke!) Have someone talk to her doctor and see if there's anything he can give her.' 
'Also, I've noticed she's had an 'odor' lately,' he continued. 'It reminds me of a combination of boiled cabbage, urine and farts. I'm guessing it's either connected to her fall or simply the fact that she rarely bathes.' 
'Outside of encouraging her to take a shower once in a while, I don't know what to do about this. — any suggestions would be appreciated.' 
Well, apparently, Hillary Clinton is just as gross as we all thought!

Just days before the it's time to vote our next President into the White House, the Clinton family get bad news, after bad news, after bad news. Now..guess what is happening? 
MORE bad news! 
However, bad news for the Clintons means good news for us. 
We all knew that Hillary was a scheming snake of corruption who loves nothing but power and money. However with each new hit that came her way in October, many of us were still shocked over the sheer madness of it all. 
Now, Wikileaks is giving Bill Clinton some time under the microscope of truth. 
Via The Daily Caller : 
Ira Magaziner, the CEO of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, asked former President Bill Clinton to thank Morocco's King Mohammed VI for 'offering his plane to the conference in Ethiopia.' 
'CHAI would like to request that President Clinton call Sheik Mohammed to thank him for offering his plane to the conference in Ethiopia,' Magaziner gushed in a November 22, 2011 email released by WikiLeaks. 
Clinton frequently has expected free, luxurious private jet travel during his post-presidential life. Clinton, his wife and daughter have artfully secured free air travel and luxurious accommodations since they left the White House. It's an effective way to accept gifts of great value without declaring them for the Clinton Foundation. 
'It's highly illegal and it's likely that the owners of these aircraft took tax deductions as a gift to the Clinton Foundation,' Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst and critic of the Clinton Foundation, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. 
Of course! Classic Clinton crap… living the life of luxury on the backs of hardworking Americans.

Well, here's a lesson for ya! Comedy and politics DON'T mix! So if you're a comedian and you want to be successful- don't bring politics into your act! Seriously, it just kills the mood, no one will be up to laughing after you insult them over who they are supporting for President, or whether or not they view abortion as murder. 
Who would find any humor in that? 
This should be common sense, but for Amy Schumer …twas not. Now she's learning the hard way, what many of us were warning her about for a while now! 
According to AdWeek, Budweiser came in under expected profits in their third quarter, prompting the company to pull the Schumer ads ahead of schedule. The ads themselves were not at all doing well, and the last one received such negative attention on YouTube that it currently has more than 1,900 'thumbs down,' compared to only 300 'thumbs up.' 
Fox News reported that, at one time, the YouTube video had comments disabled, but that has since been changed. Many comments are negative toward Schumer herself, who has recently been in traveling around promoting feminist ideals and social justice causes. 
Schumer's attitude on politics has alienated many people over the past few years, however. Many would say that the comedian's negative views on men, and hypocritical outrage, is often in complete contrast with inclusivity. This could have further attributed to the decline in Bud Light's sales, as having a wildly unpopular figure represent your product will devalue it to the public. 
Sorry Schumer. Either be a comedian, or a social justice warrior…the two however, do not play well together. Somewhere along the line you got that very obvious truth, twisted. Related Items

In a highly controversial decision, the Louisiana Supreme Court has ruled that Catholic priests are not 'mandatory reporters' of child abuse they are made privy to as a result of administering sacramental confessions. 
According to Patheos , the ruling references article 609 A(1) of the Louisiana Children's Code: 
With respect to mandatory reporters: Notwithstanding any claim of privileged communication, any mandatory reporter who has cause to believe that a child's physical or mental health or welfare is endangered as a result of abuse or neglect or that abuse or neglect was a contributing factor in a child's death shall report in accordance with Article 610. 
The Oct. 28 ruling states in part: 
… any communication made to a priest privately in the sacrament of confession for the purpose of confession, repentance, and absolution is a confidential communication under La. Code Evid. 511, and the priest is exempt from mandatory reporter status in such circumstances by operation of La. Child. Code art. 603, because 'under the … tenets of the [Roman Catholic] church' he has an inviolable 'duty to keep such communications confidential.' 
The case which originally brought this issue before the court was that of a young woman who told a Baton Rouge-area Catholic priest that a longtime parishioner had sexually assaulted her when she was 14-years-old. The priest in turn did not report the abuse.

 Reporters filled the room for the alleged victim's Press Conference, then it went down like this… An anonymous woman, known as Jane Doe, scheduled a Press Conference today to speak publicly, for the first time, about her story of rape. She says that, in 1994, she was offered modeling work and money in exchange for her attendance to a series of parties. These parties were to be held at the home of Jeffrey Epstein, who is now a convicted, registered sex offender. Epstein served thirteen months of an eighteen month sentence for running a prostitution process that involved minors. It should be noted that former President William Jefferson Clinton, husband of Democrat Presidential Nominee Hillary Clinton, has been tied to Jeffrey Epstein. Allegedly, Bill Clinton flew on Epstein's jet multiple times, and even ditched his Security Detail more than once to do so. Epstein is reported to run a vacation island where wealthy individuals can go to have sex with strangers. According to Jane Doe, she attended four parties at Epstein's venue, and Donald Trump approached her in a sexual way at every party. Allegedly, Trump raped her at the fourth and final party that she attended. Now, one week before the Presidential Election of 2016, Jane Doe scheduled a Press Conference to speak of her experience, publicly, for the first time. Doe is represented by Lisa Bloom, daughter of celebrity ambulance-chasing lawyer Gloria Allred. She is asking for $75,000 in damages. Trump's response to the allegation is clear. 'The allegations are not only categorically false, but disgusting at the highest level and clearly framed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated. There is absolutely no merit to these allegations. Period.' The Press Conference was to happen today, but, unfortunately for Jane Doe's lawyer, was cancelled.

'She is living in fear. She has decided that she is too afraid to show her face. She has been here all day, ready to do it, but unfortunately, she's in terrible fear.' So, too bad for Hillary, as well, the photo op did not happen. In the event that this event is new to you, here are '5 Fast Facts' about the case: 1.

She went to New York City the following day, but she definitely wasn't there on the day of the terrorist attacks. She toured the area on 9/12 with Mayor Rudy Giuliani then hightailed it back to DC. She didn't get her hands dirty. She went for a short photo op and now she can't even get the facts of that straight. 
It is sickening that someone would use such a tragedy for personal gain, but then, this is Hillary Clinton we're talking about. She left four Americans to die in Benghazi, she threatened women who were assaulted by her own husband, she laughed about getting a child rapist off the hook, and the list goes on and on… She is heartless.

Retired assistant FBI director James Kallstrom made history this week when he publicly endorsed Donald Trump for president. According to the Conservative Post , never before has an FBI director endorsed a presidential candidate. 
'I'm endorsing Donald Trump,' Kallstrom said on Fox News. 'I've known him 40 years. I've never endorsed a candidate. He's a good human being. He's a generous person. He's got a big heart. He's done hundreds and hundreds of things for people without fanfare.' 
'He's a good guy. He's a patriot of this country and regardless of what he says, his acts show that he is not that person. He's been in this Hollywood crowd that talks like that, a lot of people talk like that,' he continued, in reference to the leaked audio tape from 2005 in which Trump made lewd comments about women. 
'He doesn't do these things. He's a good guy. I've known his family from the time they were kids. Look at his children. Could you find a better family than he brought up in this country? This country is absolutely going in the wrong direction.' 
'Seventy percent of the people want change,' Kallstrom added, as reported by CP . 'You're not going to get change with Hillary Clinton. This is the woman that lied when she was on the Watergate staff. I mean, she's a pathological liar.'

Incredible. Just when you start to think that there is nothing more Obama could say to become more a dirt bag than he's already proven himself to be, he goes and pulls something OFF THE CHARTS stupid! 
In his efforts to push Hillary into the White House he spoke at a recent rally for her. What he had to say, was an insult to American men. 
See for yourself! 
He says he wants to be honest? He lacks the integrity to do so. So basically when men don't vote for Hillary, it's not because they are intelligent enough to recognize she is a corrupt snake whose greed and hunger for money and power will leave our country hanging by a string. It's not because they have a mind to think for themselves and decide whether she's the person for the job or not. 
Nope…according to Obama, it's because American men are racist. 
Infuriating..isn't it? 
It's just too much stupid, and we all know we shouldn't engage with it because it will drag us down to its' level and destroy us with experience in stupidity…but still. 
Sometimes I wish we could mute the stupid. Just long enough to regain our sanity back to endure through it.

 Colin Kaepernick has started a kids camp inspired by the Black Panther Party, and their popular 10 point plan and said he didn't want the media to find out. 
Well I wonder why he would not want the media to find out he was taking such a far out approach with children? 
MAYBE his goal is to make little Black Panthers out of our youth? The NY DAILY NEWS reports: 
Please don't say anything about it online,' Colin asked me a few days before the camp. 'I'm not doing this for the press and I don't want it to become a media event so that the kids and the families can feel like this is just for them.' 
nspired by the Black Panther Party, and their popular 10 point plan, on their 50th Anniversary, the camp created 10 rights that each child has the right to know. They were listed on the back of T-shirts given to each camper. 
'We're here today to fight back and give you all lessons to combat the oppressive issues that our people face on a daily basis. We're here to give you tools to help you succeed,' he said. 'We're going to give you knowledge on policing history, what the systems of policing in America were based on, and we're also going to teach you skills to make sure you always make it home safely.' 
Why couldn't Kaepernick just be normal and do something good for kids? Why so secretive? Why push such an extreme political agenda from an extremist group? 
Kaepernick could have taken another road. He has instead taken an anti-American, anti-Law Enforcement road. He has chosen the road of hate and divisiveness instead of the road of Patriotism and unity. 
Kaepernick wants to pass this line of reasoning on to children. insanity on many levels.

Anthony Weiner has checked himself into a clinic which provides counseling for those addicted to cybersex, exhibitionism, anonymous sex and porn. 
The treatment program separates men and women during their stay and electronic devices are banned at the facility. 
Weiner's world came crashing down in September, when the Daily Mail revealed he was sexting with a 15-year-old school girl, saying such lurid things as, 'I would bust that tight p***y so hard and so often that you would leak and limp for a week.' 
In another message, the estranged husband of Hillary Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin told the teen that he woke up 'hard' after thinking about her. 
Weiner knew the girl was only 15 at the time. 
An investigation involving Child Protective Services was launched and the police seized Weiner's laptop (which led to the Clinton bombshell). 
It was also discovered that Clinton's team knew Weiner had carried out another inappropriate relationship with a separate underage girl as far back as 2011, but did nothing about it.

And these people claim that Donald Trump is a racist! There goes Hillary's black vote! Whenever the term 'Nazi' is used to describe a minority group, you know things are bad. Democrat donor and Hillary Clinton supporter Benjamin Barber was caught on hidden camera voicing his opinion on blacks who may vote Republican. The disturbing comments were recorded at a fundraiser for United States Senate Candidate Deborah Ross, of North Carolina. Barber said, 'Have you hear of the Sonderkommandos? Jewish guards who helped murder Jews in the camps. So there were even Jews that were helping the Nazis murder Jews! So black who are helping the other side are seriously f*cked in the head. They're only helping the enemy who will destroy them. Maybe they think 'if I help them we'll get along okay; somehow I'll save my race by working with the murderers.' Barber was caught in this disgusting tirade on the Upper West Side of New York City after the fundraiser in September. Watch for yourself: 
Besides being disturbing, these comments have racist undertones that are more far-reaching than they even seem at first. It is as if blacks do not have the ability to work and create a good life for themselves, so they are somehow obligated to support liberals and Democrats. 
Lyndon Johnson started pandering to the black vote decades ago, and ever since, the black community has suffered. Fatherless homes, unemployment, drugs, and crime problems have plagued black communities. These communities also contain good people, people who deserve better. 
All that having been said, comparing Black Republicans to Jews who killed other Jews while in Nazi captivity is just bizarre. It appears that this man is sincere when he speaks, as well! 
Will this video make a difference in an already out of control Election?

CLASSIC corruption move… 
Now they are busted….and metaphorically caught with their pants down. What the FBI has released now, is going to make it REAL hard for the Justice Department to dodge this one… 
FBI investigators believed the audio was at least worth investigating and they grew increasingly frustrated as they ran into roadblocks erected by corruption prosecutors and even some FBI executives, sources told The Wall Street Journal. The prosecutors reportedly felt the case wasn't worth bringing to a grand jury because the individual in the secret recording wasn't working inside the Clinton Foundation. 
FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Robert Capers, were both at the center of the internal dispute, per the report: 
Amid the internal finger-pointing on the Clinton Foundation matter, some have blamed the FBI's No. 2 official, deputy director Andrew McCabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. His defenders deny that, and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation. 
At times, people on both sides of the dispute thought Mr. Capers agreed with them. Defenders of Mr. Capers said he was straightforward and always told people he thought the case wasn't strong. 
Another bombshell Fox News report published Wednesday suggested that FBI agents are now 'actively and aggressively pursuing' the Clinton Foundation case. Two separate sources told Fox News the case is now 'very high priority.'

There has never been a more crucial time to look to God, as our nation is being divided and torn apart by the selfish greed of a corrupt society with leaders that lead from behind, and hide their dark secrets right in plain sight…because, they can.

Most of all…coming together.

The Democrats are getting really nervous about Trump winning the election. They're trying to do everything that they can to tear him down even more than Hillary is already. Obama even went as far as to say that the KKK will return! 
President Barack Obama wants people in North Carolina to vote for Hillary Clinton, so he's warning them that Donald Trump would tolerate the support of the Klu Klux Klan if he's elected president. 'If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers — the Klan — and hesitate when asked about that support, then you'll tolerate that support when you're in office,' he said. 
Obama added that Trump would 'disrespect' the Constitution as president, citing the Republican nominee's vow to put Hillary Clinton in jail. 
'[Y]ou threaten to throw your opponent in jail without any due process … then imagine what you'll do when you actually have the power to violate the Constitution along those lines,' Obama warned. 
Obama made his remarks at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill on Wednesday, saying that the fate of the world rests on their shoulders. 
'I hate to put a little pressure on you, but the fate of the Republic rests on your shoulders,' he said as the audience laughed. 'The fate of the world is teetering, and you, North Carolina, are going to have to make sure that we push it in the right direction.' 
Obama dismissed all of the negative ads and bad news that hurt Hillary Clinton as 'noise' and 'distractions,' that they should put aside. 
'Every day is just hysteria and over-the-top coverage,' he said, admitting that even he was getting tired of politics. 'I understand the feeling, I promise you.' 
He argued that the choice for president was simple, because Trump was a con artist who was unfit and not ready to be president. 
'I mean, it's strange how, over time, what is crazy gets normalized,' Obama said, referring to the multiple controversial statements made by Trump during the campaign. 
'That is not the voice of America. That's not the better angels of our nature,' he said. 
If you thought things couldn't get any more ridiculous, you're wrong. This accusation is taking things to a whole new level just days before voting. It's nothing but a desperate, pathetic plea for help. Related Items

Other reports says that she was yelling in a bizarre manner, but we are used to that. 
Perhaps most telling is her pre-speech behavior. 
She is clearly pacing and viewers are noticing a nervous smile, as if she cannot sit still and is trying to convince herself that everything is ok. If you watch closely, you will see her speaking, presumably to the people around her, then swatting one hand in the air in a strange way. 
It looks as if she is using all of her self-control just to keep it together. 
Watch and decide for yourself. Make sure to study her facial expressions and the swatting of her arm. 
It is easy to understand why she is stressed. The long, controversial Presidential Campaign of 2016 is winding down, the FBI is mounting multiple investigations of her and her family, and her best friend and top assistant, Huma Abedin, is likely spilling the beans on everything she knows. It is likely that Abedin and her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, are cutting some sort of deal with authorities. 
All the while, the FBI is digging through 650,000 emails. 
Stressful indeed.

All the suspense is building up with Hillary and the FBI, as the election is literally right around the corner. What will happen to her? Who knows since the Justice Department is blocking the investigation . Obviously there's something fishy! 
Good morning Hillary Clinton! We already hit you today with FBI: Clinton Foundation Case 'Likely' Moving Toward an Indictment. What else could possibly go wrong? How about everything? 
Like audio recordings of the FBI wanting to investigate the Clinton Foundation, but the DOJ getting in the way? Yes, the same DOJ headed up by Loretta Lynch (see Nothing to Hide? AG Loretta Lynch 'Pleads Fifth' On Iran Ransom Investigation)… 
The FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case. The suspect was talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldn't tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate. But it was, they thought, worth checking out. Prosecutors thought the talk was hearsay and a weak basis to warrant aggressive tactics, like presenting evidence to a grand jury, because the person who was secretly recorded wasn't inside the Clinton Foundation. FBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors. Some executives at the bureau itself, to keep pursuing the case. 
Let me break this down for you real simple for any errant leftist who found this site while searching for Gender Queer styling tips. As a general rule, people who join the FBI respect the law. Some may even love the law. These FBI agents go through intense study and training with dreams of taking down baddies. Sometimes with a gun, sometimes with a pen. FBI agents, as a general rule, are in the FBI so they can be good guys. Okay? Okay. 
So when agents discovered Hillary Clinton, a politician sitting at the tippity-top of our government, was possibly engaging in criminality, which may have endangered the security of the United States, these FBI agents wanted to pursue. Good guys vs. Bad Lady with Cankles. 
BUT, the higher-ups (like Loretta Lynch) at the Justice Department, essentially told the FBI agents to look the other way. Hillary was being protected (or so it appears) so she could run for and become president. The first lady president. Priorities. 
Kind of runs counter to everything these FBI agents stand for, yes? It appears they were unwilling to stand down and ignore justice. This isn't so much of a surprise to us: read also CORRUPTION: FBI, DOJ Wanted to Investigate Hillary. Comey and Lynch Intervened. 
With five days to go, who knew Hillary's closing argument would be 'But I don't think I'm getting arrested?' 
I hope Hillary is feeling very scared right about now. Does she think she can just get away with all of her lies?! Apparently the entire democratic party thinks the same. These people are despicable. America, do yourself a favor and KEEP HER OUT OF OFFICE. Related Items

There are things that we tend not to agree with when it comes to Putin. However, I think when you see the point he is trying to make here, this is common ground we can all meet on and agree with one another on. 
His reason for being upset with the government is clear. They allowed a sexual predator free for reasons that are so asinine that one could think the defendant himself made the ruling. 
It's sickening.. 
The Russian president rarely comments on the internal affairs of European countries, and even less on specific court cases. However, Mr. Putin refused to stay silent this week as he slammed the Austrian justice system over a case in which the infamous 'sexual emergency' migrant rapist was alleged to have been acquitted by an Austrian court who will seek a retrial on the case, reports OE24. 
According to Mr. Putin, the court's decision was the result of a 'dissolution of traditional national values'. He added: 'In a European country a child is raped by a migrant. The court acquitted him for two reasons: he speaks the language poorly and he did not understand that the boy, yes it was a boy, didn't want this.' 
Putin called the resulting court ruling inconceivable and said that a nation that refuses to defend its children has no future. 'This is the result of the dissolution of traditional national values and a sense of guilt towards migrants,' he said. 
Breitbart London reported on the attack, which occurred late last year, in which the Iraqi asylum seeker brutally raped a ten-year-old boy in a swimming pool in the Austrian capital of Vienna. 
The boy was so brutally assaulted that he had to be hospitalised for his injuries and the migrant, when asked why he committed the crime, claimed it had been a 'sexual emergency'. The phrase became notorious on social media as many used it to highlight the clear social problems many of the new migrants presented to European societies. 
According to Austria's chief justice, the migrant had not, in fact, been acquitted of the charges, but rather the trial was expected to be re-run on the basis that the boy now suffers post-traumatic stress disorder. This new charge could allow prosecutors to put the Iraqi behind bars for up to 15 years. 
Putin says when a country refuses to protect its' children, it becomes a country with no future. What do you think about that, would you agree? Related Items
