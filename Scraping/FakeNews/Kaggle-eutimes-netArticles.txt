In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer's effort.
Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did.
In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC's activities.
He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars.
He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation.
Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn't been a problem for the month that they had the money.

A Hillary Clinton goon destroyed Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
The 'peaceful man' said that he had 4-5 family members assaulted and that hes terrible upset that he has a presidential nominee who is a 'poster child for sexual violence'. People were standing around and filming his 'brave act', we imagine it took several minutes to accomplish this, yet no one intervened, no one called the cops.
Most of the fake accusers have already been debunked but batshit crazed liberals still push on the narrative that Trump is a rapist.
This is a classic tactic from Saul Alinsky of whom Hillary Clinton idolized and based her college thesis on. Divert attention away from your issues with the same issue but falsely accusing it on your opponent. Nice!
So Hillary wants to divert attention away from her open marriage and from her husband's rapes of multiple women with false accusations of Trump. Make no mistake about it, this is not a Trump issue. She would have done the same thing with any other opponent. If it were Ted Cruz, same story, if he would have exposed Bill Clinton's rapes, the next week you would have had multiple women falsely accusing Ted Cruz of raping and groping them. Unbelievable!
The vandal identified himself as James Otis and he removed the emblem from the middle of the star to sell it and donate the money to all the women who were raped by Trump.
You would think that in the light of Project Veritas videos and how they exposed the DNC evil who paid agitators, violence, voter fraud and more they would chill out for a while but nope, the viciousness is going on. These people are pushing the limits of law in this country and as of now its a banana republic led by banana-boy Obama but if Trump gets in, a lot of people are RIGHTFULLY going to be locked up and have the key thrown away for all this chaos, anarchy and lawlessness.
LAPD is currently searching for the vandalism suspect.
Trump received his star in 2007. In July 2016 a protester built a 6-inch wall around the star which is a legitimate form of protest, but destroying the star is just anarchy and that man needs to be locked up for a while along with the Democrats who paid him to do that.
The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said they are planning to repair the star. Well at least they have some honor in them.
'People can make a difference by voting and not destroying public property' the chamber's president said.
These sort of things are normally expected to happen in poor countries with little to no freedoms where the opposition party is systematically oppressed but in a country like America which brags to the world how it is 'the greatest democracy in the world' it is surely setting a bad example which no one in its right mind would like to follow.
If it has come to the point that even the communist state press in China is saying that what the media in America is doing to Trump is pure bias, then we know how bad it is in America.
The media people in America are rubbing their hands at this one. They are truly happy and excited this happened.

According to new Wikileaks emails recently released, Huma Abedin, who is Hillary's main right hand and John Podesta her campaign manager, both confirmed that Hillary Clinton still has brain damage!!
It seems there's still cause for concerns about Hillary's health. Her concussion was cause for talk about her head and whether she was functioning normally.
In an email from April 2015 with the Wikileaks ID 29549 , her aide Huma Abedin said:
'She's going to stick to notes a little closer this am. Still not perfect in her head. '
See below:
Then there's also another Wikileaks ID 27111 from John Podesta in September 2015 where he says:
' How bad is her head? '
Even if we ignore all the pay to play and other corruption scandals, though why would anyone ignore that? Are you people sure that this person is even psychically and physically fit to be the president?
Just yesterday while in Lake Worth Florida, Hillary Clinton needed HELP from her aide guy to climb a SINGLE STEP! She stopped in front of the step, raised her hand, turned her head over to see if the guy is there and waited to grab his hand. He immediately rushed towards her and helped her out. See for yourself:

Also, remember this scene from last month at 9/11 in New York where she completely collapsed? She was all frozen up, like a peace of wood, a plank or something. They just dragged her like a corpse:

Hundreds of top doctors came out and confirmed that she has brain damage and is not fit for office. Some were working for the leftist media and when they acknowledged her problems, they had their shows canceled.

Russian strategic missile troops reportedly launched an RS-18 ballistic missile on Tuesday. The launch may have been a test of the advanced hypersonic glider warhead, which would be able to defeat US anti-missile systems.
According to previous reports this nuke is also going to be made STEALTH and impossible to be detected by any current radar systems and it will carry a payload capable of wiping off areas as big as France or US's Texas state with a single missile.
The test was conducted at midday from a site near the town of Yasny, Orenburg region, in the southern Urals, and the warhead reached the Kura test range in Kamchatka in Russia's Far East.
'The test was a success. The warhead was delivered to Kura field,' the Defense Ministry reported.
Popular defense blog MilitaryRussia.ru says the launch was meant to test Russia's hypersonic glider warhead, currently known by its developer designation, 'object 4202', or Aeroballistic Hypersonic Warhead.
A select few countries are currently developing the technology. The US has the HTV-2, a device developed by DARPA that has two partially successful tests under its belt. The Chinese warhead using the same technology is called DF-ZF, with Beijing first confirming a test in 2014. India is also studying hypersonic flight technology, but unlike Russia, the US and China, it is reportedly not developing a strategic missile warhead.
A hypersonic glider vehicle (HGV) is different from a conventional ballistic missile warhead in that it travels most of the time in the stratosphere rather than in space. It gives an HGV-tipped missile greater range and may give anti-missile systems a shorter window to respond to an attack.
More importantly, an HGV can maneuver during the approach to a target at high speed, making interception significantly harder, because it makes guiding an interceptor missile towards the attacking vehicle challenging and potentially impossible with current rocket technology.
Object 4202 is reportedly meant to be used with Russia's next-gen heavy strategic missile the RS-28 Sarmat. Military experts estimate that the new ICBM, an image of which was first made public this week, may carry up to three HGVs as payload.
A previous possible test of object 4202 was reported in April.

Tomi Lahren suggested in an interview that the Clintons are responsible for multiple murders.
A prominent journalist working at Glenn Beck's TheBlaze who had endorsed Hillary Clinton is suggesting in a new interview that Bill and Hillary Clinton are responsible for multiple murders.
Tomi Lahren spoke about comments she recently made about the Clintons having a high body count and that Bernie Sanders is only supporting Hillary out of fear he might mysteriously disappear in an interview on The Jamie Weinstein Show .
Weinstein asked Lahren during the interview: 'You think Bernie Sanders is supporting Hillary Clinton because he's afraid he is going to mysteriously disappear. You went on to say that the Clintons have a high body count. Do you believe that the Clintons really are killing people?'
She responded by saying: 'You know, sometimes we look at patterns and we look at things that are happening and sometimes you can't dismiss everything as a conspiracy.'
Weinstein then asked Lahren if she was referring to the conspiracy theory held by some that the Clintons were somehow responsible for the death of Vince Foster, a close friend of the couple who was found dead in 1993 of what was later ruled to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
'The list 'ì I will let your listeners go on and look at some of these examples and they can decide for themselves,' said Lahren.
'But there's been some mysterious circumstances that have surrounded 'ì we just saw, what with the DNC leaks and then what happened to a person that worked for the DNC that was in charge of that?'
Lahren was referring to the death of Seth Rich, who was murdered near his home in Washington DC this past July.
Soon after, DailyMail.com learned that he was set to start working for Hillary's campaign.
Weinstein pointed out to Lahren that Rich's parents said they do not suspect anything 'suspicious,' to which she replied: 'Well, his family doesn't want to be in a body bag either, Jamie.
'I have got to be honest with you. What was it? He came in and was robbed, but his wallet and his watch weren't taken? So he was robbed and what was he'¶'
And another claim: 'Sometimes you can't dismiss everything as a conspiracy,' said Lahren (Clinton above with Vince Foster, whose death Lahren also finds mysterious)
One more claim: Lahren also spoke about the death of DNC worker Seth Rich (above), saying his parents are keeping quiet out of fear of ending up in a 'body bag'
At this point Weinsten jumped in to say: 'You think he might have been killed by the Clintons?'
Lahren responded to this by stating: 'I don't know if he was killed by the Clintons or a Clinton hit person. I'm not going to sit here and be what you want me to be which is a conspiracy theorist, but I will say'¶'
Weinsten then cut in briefly to point out he was just asking Lahren questions.
Lahren continued: 'I think there are a lot of circumstances that surround the Clinton family that aren't explainable and I will let people go on and research it for themselves. And if they think there is something fishy going on, I leave it to them. I certainly do.'

A stunning Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today reveals that the Security Council (SC), this morning, authorized the sending to the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of an emergency communiquƒÇ≈† requesting an immediate explanation as to why Hillary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s money laundering organization, known as the Clinton Foundation, this past week, purchased over $137 million of illegal arms and ammunition√¢‚Ç¨'and whose destination is to be the United States, with delivery being marked as √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmid-November 2016√¢‚Ç¨¬ù. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, SVR analysts began expressing √¢‚Ç¨≈ìurgent concern√¢‚Ç¨¬ù earlier this year when the main √¢‚Ç¨≈ìelements/factions√¢‚Ç¨¬ù of the feared Viktor Bout√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s international arms smuggling crime organization began arriving in the Republic of Albania√¢‚Ç¨'that is the only Muslim nation in Europe.
Viktor Bout, this report explains, is most popularly known in the West as the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìLord of War√¢‚Ç¨¬ù for his workings with the CIA to smuggle illegal weapons throughout the world to further the maniacal interests of the United States√¢‚Ç¨'until 2011 when then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had him jailed.
Though a citizen of the Federation, this report continues, the SVR had no √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcomplaint/concern√¢‚Ç¨¬ù with Hillary Clinton having Bout jailed for 25 years as it was an internal matter of the CIA√¢‚Ç¨'but whose intelligence analysts expressed √¢‚Ç¨≈ìworry/confusion√¢‚Ç¨¬ù this past May (2016) when US Federal Judge Shira Scheindlin said he should have had a reduced sentence√¢‚Ç¨'and that led, yesterday, to Bout √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsuddenly/magically√¢‚Ç¨¬ù being transferred out of maximum security to the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcountry club atmosphere√¢‚Ç¨¬ù of the general ward of the US Federal Prison he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been confined to.
CIA illegal arms smuggler Viktor Bout
Coinciding with Bout√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmysterious/magical√¢‚Ç¨¬ù prison transfer yesterday, this report notes, was Hillary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s money laundering Clinton Foundation transferring $137.7 million to the Socialist Party of Albania (SPA) controlled by that nations Prime Minister Edi Rama√¢‚Ç¨'who is not only the head of the Xhakja Clan (known in the West as the Albanian Mafia) but who was, also, and shockingly, put into power by the Obama-Clinton regime over the protests of the Albanian people who did not want a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmafia government√¢‚Ç¨¬ù controlling them.
Hillary Clinton (left) and Albanian Xhakja Clan mafia crime leader Edi Rama (right)
With Hillary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s international arms merchant Prime Minister Rama having turned the entire Balkan region into one of the world√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s largest areas for arms smuggling that now threatens its very security, this report warns, she has been aided in this effort by what many are calling her √¢‚Ç¨≈ìpuppet master√¢‚Ç¨¬ù√¢‚Ç¨'the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros that recently released, and shocking, secret emails show him ordering Hillary Clinton to install this mafia criminal as the leader of Albania.
To fully understand why Hillary Clinton made this massive arms purchase, and no doubt was aided in doing so by the CIA√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s arms smuggler Viktor Bout, SVR analysts in this report explain, is her adherence to George Soros√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s radical vision of open borders√¢‚Ç¨'and that he singlehandedly began implementing by creating the European refugee crisis that will, likewise, engulf the United States should Hillary Clinton become president, and as exactly as her secret emails reveals she plans on doing.
Also, this report continues, and as the Federation knows all to well, the Soros-Clinton √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmaster plan√¢‚Ç¨¬ù to take down a nation begins with the establishment of what are called Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) to act as a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìshadow government√¢‚Ç¨¬ù ready to take power once the established order is thrown into chaos by massive protests√¢‚Ç¨'and why, in 2013, President Putin banned them from operating in Russia.
In the United States, however, this report grimly states, the American people have no defense against these √¢‚Ç¨≈ìshadow government√¢‚Ç¨¬ù NGO√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s√¢‚Ç¨'and that SVR intelligence assests have documented in this report as being the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìreceiving parties√¢‚Ç¨¬ù of Hillary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s massive arms purchase and include the George Soros created NGO√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s called: Open Society Foundations, Media Matters, American Institute for Social Justice, The New America Foundation, The Migration Policy Institute, Tides Foundation, Center for American Progress, and the Democracy Alliance√¢‚Ç¨'every single one of which stands violently opposed to the US Constitution and the American people.
Once these weapons are in the hands of Hillary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √¢‚Ç¨≈ìnew revolutionaries√¢‚Ç¨¬ù, this report continues, they will then be used to unleash a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìterror wave√¢‚Ç¨¬ù across America protesting Donald Trump√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s landslide victory√¢‚Ç¨'thus enabling President Obama to declare martial law to disarm all of these people, and once doing so, allow the US Electors to place Hillary Clinton in power. [Note: American presidents are NOT elected by the voting of citizens, but by the vote of the Electors selected from each of that nations 50 States.]
This report sadly concludes, though, by noting that the massive vote fraud already being committed by Hillary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √¢‚Ç¨≈ìnew revolutionaries√¢‚Ç¨¬ù throughout the United States, and that led this past week to former US Congressman Joe Walsh stunningly stating √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIf Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket√¢‚Ç¨¬ù√¢‚Ç¨'a reference to one of the darkest times in American history when that nation√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s ordinary citizens banded together to fight the British Empire for their freedom√¢‚Ç¨'should strike fear into all Americans of what Hillary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √¢‚Ç¨≈ìnew revolutionaries√¢‚Ç¨¬ù are doing right now√¢‚Ç¨'and if not, nothing will.

Donald Trump is warning America that Hillary Clinton's insane idea to create a no-fly zone over Syria would lead to World War Three with Russia, Syria and Iran.
Setting up a no-fly zone over Syria means telling the government of Syria (as well as Russia) they're not allowed to fly planes over their own country, even though they're in the middle of a war with ISIS and other US-backed rebel terrorist groups.
It's completely psychotic, that's why even leftists like Green party candidate Jill Stein have said Hillary is 'much scarier' than Trump and could slide us 'into a nuclear war' with Russia .
As you'll see in this article, Reuters asked Hillary to defend her insane plan but she just dodged the question and instead attacked Trump as 'unfit to be commander-in-chief.'
From Reuters :
U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Democrat Hillary Clinton's plan for Syria would 'lead to World War Three,' because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear-armed Russia.
In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, Trump said defeating Islamic State is a higher priority than persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, playing down a long-held goal of U.S. policy.
Trump questioned how Clinton would negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin after demonizing him; blamed President Barack Obama for a downturn in U.S. relations with the Philippines under its new president, Rodrigo Duterte; bemoaned a lack of Republican unity behind his candidacy, and said he would easily win the election if the party leaders would support him.
'If we had party unity, we couldn't lose this election to Hillary Clinton,' he said.
On Syria's civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict.
Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and 'safe zones' on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets.
'What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,' said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. 'You're going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.
'You're not fighting Syria any more, you're fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,' he said.
Clinton's campaign dismissed the criticism, noting that both Republican and Democratic national security experts have denounced Trump as unfit to be commander-in-chief.
'Once again, he is parroting Putin's talking points and playing to Americans' fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria,' Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said in a statement.
Trump said Assad is much stronger now than he was three years ago and said getting Assad to leave power was less important than defeating Islamic State.
'Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,' he said.
A memo was leaked earlier this year showing Hillary Clinton's State Department said on December 31, 2012 that overthrowing Syria was the 'best way to help Israel.' 

The foreign policy goals in that State Department memo just so happen to align with the goals of this powerful Israeli think tank :

Seeing as how the U.S. just last month conducted an airstrike on a group of Syrian fighters to help ISIS overrun one of their positions , it's not unreasonable to question what the hell is actually going on here.
Uniting with Assad and Russia to destroy ISIS, as Trump has said he would do, is without a doubt the sane plan in Syria if one wants to pursue America's interests. Instead, Clinton and Obama are trying to both overthrow Assad by arming 'good' rebel groups and somehow also kill ISIS on the side 'ì though it just so happens the weapons they're giving to the 'good' rebels keep falling into ISIS's hands.
The result has been what we're seeing in Syria 'ì an endless, drawn out war leading to untold human misery, suffering, death and the migrant crisis.

Look at what is happening now across the European continent! Europe is being occupied by invading hoards of millions of Muslims as we speak, demanding more mosques to be built with state money (tax payer money), chanting Allahu Akbar in the streets, teaching Muslim prayers in schools, banning Christmas street lights and more!
Some of these migrants even took it to a step further, now posing as 'children'. Some stupid Europeans actually believe them and adopted them as their own children. 20-30 even up to 40 year old men! Imagine adopting a 30 year old man as your 'child''¶
Despite having nationalist political parties surging across the continent, there has been no major victory!!! The nationalists do NOT own a single country in Europe! France is still under socialist Hollande, Austria, Netherlands, Italy, Greece everyone is still under socialist/liberal leadership.
Despite having the UK historically exiting the EU with their famous Brexit vote, the UK is still under 'principled conservative' leadership, you know that conservatism similar to Paul Ryan (open borders). The country fell on Theresa May's hands after Boris Johnson who helped Nigel Farage make Brexit happen cucked-out and refused to take the leadership. Theresa May is super similar to David Cameron, the former Prime Minister who resigned after Brexit. Both David and Theresa are like Jeb! Bush or Paul Ryan clones. Same 'principled conservative' rhetoric but with open borders.
Europe is basically lost and no one can do anything about it at this point. Even a classic revolution is impossible at this point. There's no spirit, we don't have a strong leader here in Europe like they do in America, with Donald Trump, our European nationalist leaders are all weak, soft cucks. The people are too materialistic, they chase money, music, movies, games like nothing else matters.
Here's the average European daily conversation in BOTH West AND East Europe: 'Look at my new car! Do you like it?? You wanker, who cares about Muslim immigration, check out my new Iphone 7! And have you heard that new Beyonce song which tells whites to fuck themselves? Wow its so awesome! By the way I'm going to Ibiza next week! Bloody hell mate, let's play my new FIFA 17 PS4 game before you go, it has awesome graphics mate! It's better than PES 17!!!' This is no exaggeration and this is exactly how European people behave these days. All Europeans, UK, France, Spain, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Poland, Italy, Austria, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, even Russia, EVERYONE! Total cuckoldry!
Some people like to think that East Europe is somewhat purer and holier than the West but it's not anymore. Especially Americans have this idea that Eastern Europe is not as tainted as the West. Its the same thing, the eternal chase of entertainment.
The question is what's next? How would Christians survive as minorities among these peaceful people? Perhaps we should pack our bags and start a new white flight to Russia. As long as Putin is in power we know he is gonna protect the rights of European Christian people and ensure their survival. Lets hope and pray he would allow us to invade his country. While Russia is no different in those terms, at least they have a leader who watches over them and protects them while they have fun. Another option would be to pack our bags and move to America if Trump wins and IF Trump would allow us to go there'¶. because we do know he's very anti-immigration. Should Hillary 'win' (steal the election) may God help us all because WW3 is upon us.
So here's a bunch of new Muslim challenges Europe is now facing:
GERMANY 'ì Children Forced to learn Muslim prayers and shout Allahu Akbar 

Pupils at a primary school were forced to chant 'Allahu Akhbar' and 'there is no God but Allah', an appalled father has claimed.
The father of the pupil at the girl's primary school in German ski resort Garmisch-Partenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the Islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given.
He claimed she had been 'forced' by teachers to memorise the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24.
The handout read: 'Oh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you.'
It had been given to the girl during a lesson in 'ethics' at the Bavarian school.
ITALY 'ì Thousands of Muslims Pray in the Streets of Rome near Colosseum, Shout Allahu Akbar, Demand more Mosques 

Thousands of Muslims gathered in protest outside Rome's Colosseum Friday after Italian authorities shut down a number of so-called 'garage mosques' to avoid young people becoming radicalized.
The Muslim community of Rome chose the iconic Colosseum, a worldwide symbol of Christian persecution and martyrdom, to stage their demonstration against the alleged shutting down by police of illegal places of Muslim worship in the city.
Many Roman citizens were visibly disturbed by the protest, noting that in its propaganda videos, the Islamic State has repeatedly employed images of the Colosseum when threatening to conquer Rome and the 'Crusaders.'
Two months ago, Italian police set up a high-security perimeter around the Colosseum, after the Islamic State issued a new threat to 'conquer' Rome in its latest video.
UNITED KINGDOM 'ì British press wants more 40-year-old migrant 'children' posing as 16-year-old 

Won't you take pity on this poor, innocent little child?
This image of a '16-year-old' migrant crying 'ì which is currently plastered on the front page of The Guardian 'ì is nothing short of laughable.
'A 16-year-old from Ethiopia cries while he awaits registration at a processing centre in the makeshift refugee camp near Calais,' the photo's caption reads. The image is placed under a headline reading: 'Councils resist pressure to take children from Calais.'
The 'child migrant' is clearly in his 40's, yet their editors evidently believe their readers are so incredibly stupid they'll actually believe they're looking at a 16-year-old boy.
This comes amid a recent report where grown men pose as children in the UK , get adopted by British families then threaten to 'love' them in exchange for their care. Some were even caught drawing ISIS flags on 1st grade coloring books.
SWEDEN 'ì Christmas Street Lights BANNED to Avoid Offending Muslim Migrants 

Towns across Sweden have banned Christmas street lights in the name of 'security,' but the real reason is almost certainly because the country has completely capitulated to Islam after importing countless Muslim migrants over the last two years.
According to an SVT report, The Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) will not allow municipalities to erect Christmas street lights on light poles that the authority manages, meaning that many towns will have no festival lights at all on major streets.
Despite there being no safety issue with the street lights for decades, this new rule has been instituted right after record numbers of Muslim migrants flooded into the country 'ì just a coincidence I'm sure.
In reality, the Christmas lights ban is almost certainly an effort to avoid offending Muslim migrants who are causing chaos in cities like Malmo, where the firebombing of cars and businesses in or near Muslim ghetto 'no-go areas' is becoming a routine occurrence.

A new email released as part of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accusing Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being 'stupid'.
The Wikileaks email ID 31909 , sent to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and another Clinton ally CEO Roy Spence, centers around a discussion of a Bernie Sanders campaign ad which featured 'many black faces'.
Back in January, Clinton operative David Brock caused consternation within the campaign when he publicly claimed that Bernie Sanders didn't care about black people.
Budowsky is not impressed with Brock's outburst, writing in the email, 'Brock makes the cardinal mistake of those who bring politics into disrepute with voters. He tells a lie that people will know is a lie, and insults the intelligence of black voters with a kind of elitist racism that Bill and Hillary Clinton should not be seen with.'
'I guess Brock's plan is that black voters are stupid and will not watch the ad and believe his lie,' writes Budowsky.
'I cannot think of anything more desperate, more stupid and more self-destructive than David Brock lying about the Bernie ad and playing a seamy brand of the politics of race using the tactic of deceit on her behalf,' adds the The Hill and Huffington Post columnist, before offering to write a campaign ad for HIllary to counter the Bernie Sanders ad.
The email once again underscores the Clinton camp's paranoia about not being able to authentically connect with African-American voters in a way that Bernie Sanders could.
Some black voters have been reluctant to support Clinton as a result of her support for a 1994 crime bill that resulted in the mass incarceration of young black Americans, whom Hilary referred to at the time as 'super predators'.

Megyn Kelly will co-host 'Live with Kelly' alongside Kelly Ripa on the morning after the presidential election, Nov. 9. It's anyone's guess what the Nov. 9 timing means.
The Fox News host of the 'The Kelly File' will join Ripa much like Anderson Cooper, Seth Meyers and others have been doing as co-hosts since Michael Strahan left the show for a new role on 'Good Morning America,' according to People magazine on Wednesday.
Actress Naomi Watts and actor Michael Ealy are also scheduled to appear that day.
The Wrap noted that Kelly's co-hosting gig comes as speculation continues to swirl about her next move as her Fox News contract expires in 2017.
'Live with Kelly' which is nationally syndicated by Disney/ABC Home Entertainment and TV Distribution, noted People.
'Cue up speculation that Kelly is flirting with ABC News 'ì 'Live with Kelly' being syndicated by ABC-parent Disney, and a timeslot competitor to NBC News' cash cow 'Today' show,' said Lisa Moraes on Deadline.com.
'In one of those incredible coincidences, word of the booking on the significant election-cycle morning broke the same day Fox News interim CEO Rupert Murdoch gave an interview to his newspaper Wall Street Journal, to publicly announce Kelly is important to the network and he hopes to get her under contract 'very soon,' while adding, ominously, 'we have a deep bench of talent, many of whom would give their right arm for her' timeslot.'
CNN Worldwide chief Jeff Zucker praised Kelly earlier this month, calling her 'a tremendous news anchor' but was coy in addressing her contract coming to an end at Fox News, according to Deadline.com, adding 'I'll leave it there.'
Kelly and fellow Fox News host Sean Hannity had publicly feuded this month over the presidential election, according to the Washington Post, and she told Variety in April she was unsure whether she would resign with Fox News.
'I really like my show, and I love my team,' Kelly told Variety then. 'But you know, there's a lot of brain damage that comes from the job. There was probably less brain damage when I worked in the afternoon. I was less well known. I had far less conflict in my life.'
'I also have three kids who are soon going to be in school from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. I come to work at 3:30. I like to see my children. Having said that, my boss has been good about working with me to make me happy 'ì he knows I'm a hard worker. I've had few problems here where I couldn't talk to him and say, 'Can we work something out?,' and come away happy,' she added.

A burial slab believed to have held the body of Jesus Christ before he was resurrected has been uncovered for the first time in centuries by a restoration team in Jerusalem.
The original limestone shelf, known as a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìburial bed,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù was exposed during the restoration of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre after being covered by marble since at least 1555 A.D.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt will be a long scientific analysis, but we will finally be able to see the original rock surface on which, according to tradition, the body of Christ was laid,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Fredrik Hiebert, an archaeologist involved in the discovery, told National Geographic.
According to scripture, Jesus Christ was laid on the shelf in the tomb after dying at the crucifixion around 33 A.D. After three days his remains were discovered to be missing and Jesus was said to have appeared over a span of 40 days before ascending into heaven.
The discovery was made by a team of scientists from the National Technical University of Athens (NTU) who were making restorations to the Edicule (√¢‚Ç¨≈ìlittle house√¢‚Ç¨¬ù), a structure which had been built around the tomb.
The tomb was found underneath this Crypt at the Sepulchre Church. Throughout the years there have been many conspiracies about the location of Jesus's tomb but the Christian Orthodox Church has always maintained that the tomb is underneath Sepulchre Church.
Researchers now hope to study the original surface to better understand the original tomb and how it evolved to become one of the most sacred sites in Christendom.
'We are at the critical moment for rehabilitating the Edicule,' Chief Scientific Supervisor Professor Antonia Moropoulou told National Geographic. 'The techniques we're using to document this unique monument will enable the world to study our findings as if they themselves were in the tomb of Christ.'
The newly-uncovered surface was described as having a grey-beige stone surface.
Also known as the Church of the Resurrection, its custody is shared between six Christian denominations including the Greek Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church and the Armenian Orthodox Church, whom together invited the NTU to undertake the restoration.
At a cost of US$4 million, (√¢'ö≈π3.7 million) the restoration was not cheap, with major donors including Jordan's King Abdullah II and Mica Ertegun, widow of Atlantic Records co-founder Ahmet Ertegun.

The FBI has learned of more emails involving Hillary Clinton's private email server while she headed the State Department, FBI Director James Comey told several members of Congress, telling them he is reopening the investigation.
'In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of email that appear to be pertinent' to Clinton's investigation, Comey wrote to the chairs of several relevant congressional committees, adding that he was briefed about the messages on Thursday. 'I agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.'

The FBI director cautioned, however, that the bureau has yet to assess the importance of the material, and that he doesn't know how long that will take.
The Clinton campaign has yet to comment, but an aide told CNN: 'We're learning about this just like you all are.'
Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine was asked about Comey's letter while campaigning at an early voting site in Tallahassee, Florida. 'Gotta read a little more, gotta read a little more,' he told reporters.
Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, praised the decision to reopen the case.
'Now that the FBI has reopened the matter, it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness,' he said in a statement. 'The American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law.'
Almost 15,000 new Clinton emails were discovered in September, but it's unclear if the announced investigation relates to them or other correspondence. The newly discovered emails are not related to Wikileaks or the Clinton Foundation, law enforcement sources told CNN's Evan Perez.
The messages were not found on the private email server in the Clintons' New York residence, a government source told Reuters.
The emails were apparently discovered as part of the sexting probe into former Representative Anthony Weiner (D-New York), the New York Times reported. His electronic devices, as well as those belonging to his wife, senior Clinton aide Huma Abedin, were seized during that investigation.
House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) renewed his call for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to 'suspend all classified briefings for Secretary Clinton until this matter is fully resolved.'
'Yet again, Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame,' Ryan said in a statement. 'This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators.'
Kellyanne Conway, Republican nominee Donald Trump's campaign manager, applauded the decision.
'That is superb. That is extraordinary news for the American people,' she told Yahoo News. 'A great day in our campaign just got even better,' she tweeted.
'They are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States,' Trump said in Manchester, New Hampshire, 10 minutes after learning about the reopening of the case. 'We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.'
'I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made,' he said. 'This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understand, and it is everybody's hope that it is about to be corrected.'
'With that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech?' he joked before turning to his prepared remarks.
The 'FBI reopening investigation isn't an October surprise, it's an October nuclear explosion,' conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro wrote as part of a tweetstorm, adding that 'Comey [is] trying to cover his a** 11 days before [the] election' and wondering if a 'pre-emptive impeachment of a president elect' is possible because 'the odds on President Tim Kaine just rose substantially.'
An 'October Surprise' is a major event that happens in the month before the election that affects the outcome of the vote.
In response to the announcement, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint with the Department of Justice against Comey.
'It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election,' Scott Dworkin, senior advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, said in a statement. 'It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.'
Stocks fell after Comey's announcement, CNBC reported.

No wonder they're so confident!
Dominion Voting Systems brags on its home page that 'Together with our customers, we strive to change elections for the better!'
Wikipedia currently reports that Dominion provides voting machines to 22 states.
If you hit the link to this statement, however, the supporting post has now been taken down.
Dominion Voting Systems is owned by George Soros an internationalist billionaire who is openly supporting Hillary Clinton and donated to her campaign dozens of millions of dollars.

We now know that the machines are already flipping out votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton in Texas, Illinois, North Carolina and other states. The people working at the voting boots always find out some WHATEVER excuses while so far there hasn't been a single vote switched from Hillary to Trump.
Soros is also said to control a British company called Smartmatic, which had something to do with election fraud in Venezuela. Thanks to the Smartmatic machines, communists 'won' the elections over and over again.
Smartmatic is tied to Soros' Open Road Foundation and it used to have a subsidiary called Sequoia. Sequoia electronic voting machines are used in the US general election. Sequoia was eventually sold to Dominion Voting Systems.
How do you like that people? The man in charge of counting your votes happens to have a favorite.
This is exactly like Joseph Stalin's famous quote: 'The people who cast the votes don't decide an election, the people who count the votes do.' 
It does't matter that you go out and vote for Trump, what matters is that Soros is gonna count votes the way he wants to and that's just not right to have a private person in charge of the elections basically.
Soros needs to have his entire fortune confiscated by the US government, nationalized and included in the state budget and have him locked up for the rest of his miserable life. Remember how those commie SJWs call for equality and taking from the rich and giving to the poor? Sure lets start with this high-profile thief right here.
The system is rigged people and Trump is right! Voting should only be on paper not on machines which can be manipulated easily!

Around 300 civilians were killed in eleven airstrikes conducted by the US-led coalition in Syria, which Amnesty International investigated for its latest report. Amnesty says the US must come clean about the civilian toll of its fight against Islamic State.
Amnesty suspects that US Central Command (CENTCOM), which directs coalition airstrikes in Syria, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmay have√¢‚Ç¨≈ö carried out unlawful attacks√¢‚Ç¨¬ù in Syria , failing to take necessary measures to prevent civilian killings.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe fear the US-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù said Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for Research at Amnesty International√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Beirut regional office.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s high time the US authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria. Independent and impartial investigations must be carried out into any potential violations of international humanitarian law and the findings should be made public.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Amnesty investigated evidence, including eyewitness accounts, reports by human rights organizations and the media, photographs and video footage as well as satellite imagery, related to 11 suspected coalition attacks in Syria. The group estimates that the attacks have claimed as many as 300 civilian lives. So far none of these deaths has been acknowledged by CENTCOM.
The report published on Wednesday added that the total civilian death toll from coalition action √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcould be as high as 600 or more than 1,000√¢‚Ç¨¬ù since the operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL) started in Syria in 2014.
One of the strikes investigated by Amnesty took place in the early hours of December 7, 2015. The attacks hit two houses in the village of Ayn al-Khan, near al-Hawl in al-Hasakah governorate in northern Syria, killing 40 civilians, including 19 children, and injuring at least 30 others, the report said.
According to an eyewitness account, an initial night strike was followed by a second attack from a helicopter gunship, which hit first responders trying to dig out survivors.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAt this point I had a two-month-old baby boy in my arms whom I had rescued. The hit caused me to fall and drop him√¢‚Ç¨≈ö I fell into the hole made by the air strike. That was what saved me√¢‚Ç¨≈ö My mother, aunt, wife and children √¢‚Ç¨' a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed. The woman and her son who I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d rescued were killed. Everyone but me was killed,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù the survivor said.
The strike is believed to have targeted IS fighters. But local Kurdish militia reportedly warned the coalition that there were civilians in the area.
Amnesty said CENTCOM√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s failure to acknowledge civilian deaths in Syria, as well as the poor record of investigating such incidents in Afghanistan and Iraq, poses grave concerns over the toll which the civilian population of Mosul, Iraq is likely to face from the ongoing operation to take the city from IS. The US-led coalition is providing air support for the offensive.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGiven the likely increase in air strikes by the US-led Coalition as part of the Iraqi offensive to recapture Mosul, it is even more pressing that CENTCOM be fully transparent about the impact of their military actions on civilians. And it is crucial that they adhere scrupulously to international humanitarian law, including by taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and to minimize harm to civilian homes and infrastructure,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù said Maalouf.
A similar operation to capture Manbij, Syria, which is far smaller than Mosul, killed more than 200 civilians, Amnesty estimated.
Meanwhile, US State Department spokesman John Kirby said that the US √¢‚Ç¨≈ìtakes seriously all credible allegations of civilian casualties.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìPentagon has a fairly comprehensive system for analyzing themselves what these allegations are and then, when they feel that they want further investigation, they do it. And unlike any other military in the world, they actually release the results of these investigations. And unlike any other military in the world, if the hold people accountable for their actions they [bring them to justice] too,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Kirby said during the press briefing on Wednesday.
At the same time, he said that the Department of State is not aware of the Amnesty√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s report about the US Central Command (CENTCOM) strikes in Syria and suggested contacting the Pentagon for that matter. He also welcomed the Amnesty√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √¢‚Ç¨≈ìinput√¢‚Ç¨¬ù and stressed that √¢‚Ç¨≈ìno military tries harder than the US military to limit, to prevent casualties to civilians or damage to civilian infrastructure.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe are not at all afraid to receive criticism about our efforts,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Kirby added.
The 300 fatalities are those that Amnesty considers credible, but the number is likely around 900, the report√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s author, Neil Sammonds, told RT. He said that while there were some indications that the Pentagon would try to improve the targeting of its strikes in Syria, so far this hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t happened.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìUntil now the big picture in Syria is that they are not investigating thoroughly enough, they are not aware as they should be of the amount of civilians they have killed, and it means that it is quite possible that they will be killing more civilians in their campaign to retake Mosul from Islamic State.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
He added that Amnesty was focusing on other parties in the Syrian conflict, including the Syrian government, Russia, terrorist groups and armed rebels, who, he said, are responsible for more civilian deaths than the US-led coalition, which explains why the report didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t come sooner.
Last week, Amnesty International blasted Russia for civilian deaths in Aleppo. The Syrian city is divided between government forces and various armed groups, including the Al-Qaeda offshoot Al-Nusra Front. Russia says that the militants use civilians as human shields and would not allow them to leave the city, derailing several attempts by Russia to open humanitarian corridors out of the city.

A new email released by Wikileaks as part of the Podesta dump features Hillary ally Wendy Bronfein advising Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta on how to reach 'f**king dumb' young people.
Marketing executive Bronfein tells Podesta in Wikileaks ID 34866 that Clinton 'may not be the best face' to attract younger voters and that she needs to utilize 'trending figures' as par of an 'infusion to pull younger voters' because 'that's the crap that young people pay attention to'.
Bronfein goes on to state, 'It's f**king dumb but being 'cool' counts for more than it maybe should.'
She references Bill Clinton's saxophone playing as an example of this before asserting, 'I hate to generalize a generation but by social media nature, they 'follow'. So if someone they identify as cool endorses 'ì they will likely fall in line with that candidate.'
Bronfein is introduced to John Podesta in another email as someone who 'could be immensely helpful in improving HRC's connection to millennials.'
The email is yet another example of the disdain that Hillary insiders have for Clinton's own voters.
Yesterday, we highlighted how Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accused Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being 'stupid'.
In an audio recording leaked earlier this month, Hillary Clinton was caught on tape saying Bernie Sanders supporters are 'living in their parents' basement' and had bought into a 'false promise'. In another Wikileaks Hillary Clinton was caught calling Bernie Sanders youth supporters ' bucket of losers '.
In another email , Clinton operative Bill Ivey spoke of the need to maintain political power by producing 'an unaware and compliant citizenry'.

An absolutely astonishing Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today details an extended telephonic conversation held Thursday between President Putin and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey wherein America's top law enforcement officer asked Russia's leader 'Is Anthony Weiner yours?', to which Putin replied, 'You should ask Aleksandr Poteyev''îand that led, less than 24 hours after this call ended, to Hillary Clinton being placed, once again, under FBI investigation. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, Director Comey's call to President Putin was in regards to the Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) this past Tuesday advising all Federation security and intelligence organizations to cease all contact and cooperation with the FBI'îand that we detailed in our report titled Russia Breaks All Contact With Hillary Clinton's 'Ministry Of Terror''îOnce Called The FBI.
With 'many/numerous' joint terrorism and international criminal investigations currently ongoing between FIS agencies and the FBI, this report continues, Director Comey expressed his concerns to President Putin that the ending of them 'would/could' cause 'dangers/alarms' to both the Federation and United States'îto which President Putin agreed, and in a bid to ease Russian-US war tensions publically stated after this call ended that 'Russia is not going to attack anyone, that's ridiculous'.
Though not the 'main/central' focus of their conversation, this report notes, President Putin did become 'annoyed/perturbed' when Director Comey asked him about former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (aka Carlos Danger) while seeming to allege that he was in some way a Russian spy'îand that President Putin bluntly replied to by reminding Director Comey that the correct person to ask that question to was former Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) officer Aleksandr Poteyev, whose location could be found by asking the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
SVR officer Poteyev, this report details, was the 'overseer/director' of a Federation 'honeypot' intelligence operation operating in the United States whose mission was to 'discover/unmask' high ranking American elite politicians, bankers, businessmen, etc., preying upon young Russian girls brought to that country to perform pedophile sex acts.
Once these sexually deviant elite Americans who preyed upon these young Russian girl children were identified by the SVR, this report explains, they were put under electronic surveillance'îand once being notified of this, many of them volunteered to assist the Federation in 'other meaningful ways'.
This highly successful SVR operation was, however, destroyed, this report continues, when SVR officer Poteyev turned against the Federation and became an operative for the American CIA'îwho this past July, immediately after FBI Director Comey announced Hillary Clinton would face no charges for her crimes, was suddenly declared dead (without any evidence) by the CIA, but that the SVR knows is not the truth.
Master SVR intelligence officer Anna Kushchyenko (in the US known as Anna Chapman) just prior to her and other SVR 'operatives/specialists' being betrayed to the CIA by Poteyev, this report continues, had identified US Congressman Anthony Weiner as being a pedophile and targeted him for 'extreme/radical' electronic surveillance'îbut whose mission was ended on 27 June 2010 with her arrest by US authorities.
The SVR's 'extreme/radical' electronic surveillance of Congressman Weiner was justified, this report explains, due not only to his being a sexual deviant, but, also, because his wife, Huma Abedin, was the top aide to then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton'îwhom the Federation has long noted is an 'existential threat' to the entire world.
This report doesn't mention in its unclassified portions if the SVR continued their electronic surveillance of Congressman Weiner, but does allude to the CIA picking up this investigation where intelligence officer Anna Kushchyenko left off'îand as evidenced by the CIA's outing him as a sexual deviant 11 months later in May 2011.
To why the CIA turned the SVR's Congressman Weiner surveillance operation against Hillary Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin, this report further notes, was due to Secretary Clinton, in 2011, ordering the killing of Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi (and the destruction of Libya)'îwho was a major CIA asset and had allowed, since 2004, this US spy agency to use his country to interrogate (actually torture) high value Islamic terror leaders.
Within 24 hours of President Putin directing FBI Director Comey to look for answers about Congressman Weiner's association with Russia by asking Aleksandr Poteyev (really the CIA), this report continues, Director Comey notified the US Congress that his investigation into Hillary Clinton was being re-opened'îand was due to the 'mysterious/magical' appearance of tens-of-thousands of secret Hillary Clinton emails discovered on the computer of former Congressman Weiner, and that led Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein to state that a 'real bombshell' had been discovered otherwise the FBI wouldn't have dared begin this whole sordid process again.
To how the Obama regimes FBI, CIA and Department of Justice (DoJ) will untangle the Hillary Clinton catastrophe they've ensnared themselves, and the American people, into this report doesn't even venture an opinion on'îbut it does conclude by noting that the chaos enveloping America right now includes not only their presidential election, but Attorney General Loretta Lynch stunningly pleading the 5th Amendment in a letter to the US Congress this week over the payment of $1 billion in cash to Iran, and a terrifying new US Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure set to go into effect on 1 December that will legalize the ability of the US government to hack into computers in any jurisdiction, even in foreign nations.
Leading any ordinary American, one would think, to ask of themselves the same thing Donald Trump has been asking: 'Why not vote for me, what the hell do you have to lose?''îafter all, with Hillary Clinton having already been caught on tape talking about rigging one election, whose to say she isn't about to do it again?

Decade-old audio exposes then-Senator Hillary Clinton saying the US should have manipulated Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 to prevent a Hamas victory. The presidential candidate lamented that the US didn't 'determine who was going to win.'
'I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,' then-New York Senator Clinton told the Jewish Press, a New York-based weekly newspaper, several months after the January election.
'And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win,' she said.
Until Friday, the comment Clinton made on September 5, 2006, only existed on a private audio cassette belonging to journalist Eli Chomsky. An editor and a staff writer for the Jewish Press, he interviewed Clinton at the newspaper's office in Brooklyn.

Chomsky, who shared and played the tape for the Observer, says it is the only existing copy of that meeting with Clinton, during which the Palestinian parliamentary election was among top topics. The comments have been posted on SoundCloud.
Speaking to the news portal, he recalled being confused by the fact that 'anyone could support the idea 'î offered by a national political leader, no less 'î that the US should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.'
The interview took place nine months after the Hamas movement claimed 76 of the 132 parliamentary seats, pushing aside the US-favored Fatah movement and securing the right to form a new cabinet. That victory was neither welcomed in Israel, nor in the US. In Washington, where Hamas is considered a terrorist organization, officials repeatedly stated that they would not work with a Palestinian Authority that included Hamas.
Then-President George W. Bush spoke of the elections as symbolizing the 'power of democracy,' but refused to deal with Hamas as long as it opposed Israel's existence and espoused violence.
That day in September 2006, Clinton made 'odd and controversial comments,' all now saved on the 45-minute record that Chomsky 'held onto all these years.'
'I went to my bosses at the time,' Chomsky told the Observer. 'The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody 'î even a direct quote from anyone 'î in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn't think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.'

Trump: "I'm Afraid the Election is Going to be Rigged" LewGD 
I seriously doubt that disgusting 'grieving' Paki father do rely grieves after his son. I would rather say POS is milking his 'grievance' and his 'sacrifice'. Sacrifice he is babbling about is not HIS sacrifice but the one from his son eventually. The son lost his life in the war staged by Bush & Co and supported by Hillary, and hypocrite bastard father never raised a word against these people. Instead motherfucker accuses Trump who was against the war that caused 'his sacrifice'. 
In Iraq, American Soldiers and Marines have been dragged in an Imperial expeditionary war, where too many lost their lives unnecessarily, particularly those riding infamous Humwees, known as widow makers. In such war neither families nor war fighters sacrificed anything. Families have been robbed of their sons and sons have been robbed of their lives. 
Scumbag Paki layer also said how he would never be in the US if it would depend on Trump. He 'forgot' to say that if he would never have immigrated to the US, his son would never go in that war and his son would be alive. It's obvious that Paki Turd is making business from his 'grieving'. He made deal with the (((Satanic))) Mafia, hence his soul is black, not Trump's. 
If he would be sincere with this he would rather raise questions long time ago why Soldiers and Marines were sent in the war in Humvees to be blown off almost the same way as if they were riding bicycles. Mother of killed Seal in the Benghazi addressed Hillary directly as a prime culprit. 
Apart of this, RNC made bad decision having their convention prior of DNC. It was stupid move, or maybe intentionally 'stupid', if we take in consideration relations within GOP camp. 
Trump should be very careful in his reactions now, he better find himself a gang of extra-cunning advisers to fend off rotten scoundrels from Hillary's (((Mafia))). It is an imperative because too many ordinary voters are total political idiots. Until now, (((Democraps))) managed to fool recklessly naive and politically dumb UNDECIDED voters. 
Trump should stop reacting as a Bull on a red flag on every provocation. His stormy temper would cost him his presidency. If Trump loses, America loses, Amurkistan wins and Europe becomes Eurabia.

Some of you may wonder and ask yourselves WHY has the FBI reopened the the Clinton email case. Anthony Weiner is just the surface reason.
FBI Director James Comey saw the mutiny within the FBI with many FBI agents revolting over his decision not to prosecute Hillary Clinton back in July 2016.
So here's the bombshell: Comey decided to reopen Hillary's email investigation because he is fearing that he will get arrested and put behind bars for corruption and collusion in case Donald Trump wins.
He reopened the case, to create an escape route in case Trump wins. Its quite simple actually. James Comey did not provide any recent proof he stumbled upon and neither will he until the election is over. Yes he's technically not allowed to but he could just indict Hillary in a second if he truly wanted just for lying to the FBI or wiping the server to get rid of all the evidence after receiving a congressional subpoena.
So if Hillary Clinton wins, Comey will simply close the case and declare that nothing was substantial after all and she dust made a mistake, just like he did before.
If Donald Trump wins, he will finalize the investigation and put Hillary Clinton behind bars, then he will tell Donald Trump: 'See? I was fair and I wasn't corrupt! I DID arrest her after all and I did my job!' hoping to get away with what he did during the first investigation.
Make no mistake about it, this isn't coincidence, Comey surely fears Trump's retribution, the decision to reopen the investigation came just 1 single day after Trump called the FBI corrupt and called for a reopening of the investigation, see for yourself .
Trump is pretty tolerant guy so this may actually work out for Comey. He wrongfully forgave many people! For example, after having an conflict with Paul Ryan refusing to endorse Trump back in the primaries, Trump finally decided to forgive Ryan and ENDORSE him right before the Wisconsin congress elections. If Trump wasn't soft regarding some of those traitors, he would have endorsed Paul Nehlen instead but he didn't and it was a mistake as we now know.
Comey however will have to look authentic though and he will have to prove to Trump BEFORE the elections that he is truly on to something and that this isn't just a political move. Don't expect for Comey to go to hard because he's well aware that if he goes too hard on Queen of the Underworld Hillary and she wins, then he will rot in jail for the rest of his life because Hillary is the revengeful type.
Just to prove the case that she is revengeful, look at what she did after Trump slammed Bill Clinton as a rapist during the 2nd debate. Before the 3rd debate even started, she paid a couple of skanks to go out and publically lie, falsely accuse Trump of raping and groping them. During the 2nd debate she was looking at Trump with hatred while he was speaking and she was looking like she was thinking to herself things similar to this: 'Ohh yeah? F**k you! Wait till you see what I'll do to you next time! You're gonna regret this!' And YES she was even seen on live TV telling Trump 'F**k you!' during the 2nd debate . Hillary was infuriated because Trump brought Bill's rape victims up during that debate, but most people didn't catch it! She was clearly infuriated and already plotting revenge in her mind.
So with that said, don't expect Hillary Clinton to get indicted BEFORE the election. It's not gonna happen. Comey is a weasel appointed by Obama. Basically he's a Democrat. The funny thing is that even though he's a Democrat in disguise, fellow Democrats are already calling Comey 'traitor', 'Russian agent' and 'Putin puppet' on Twitter . Everyone who disagrees with them must be a Russian agent these days. They really love their conspiracy theories. After all isn't John Podesta interested in aliens, UFOs and Area 51? You can't make this stuff up. Really funny stuff to watch those crazy liberals going full psycho.
But even if Comey is playing on the safe side with both candidates, Hillary would definitely sink her fangs into his neck for reopening the case, should she win. Even if he does NOTHING and just closes the case after a Hillary victory, she would still take her revenge. It's in her character, she's revengeful and besides its a classic mafia tactic, leave no traitor alive or among your ranks. She would at the very least replace him.
Additionally Comey wanted to calm down an FBI which was facing a full pitchfork revolution from within with many agents being angered by this. Jill McCabe, the wife of the FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe who investigated Hillary Clinton, received a $675.000 'donation' (bribe) from Hillary Clinton. The agents were angry. So this move to reopen the case was also strategic with his agents. It will calm the waters down for a while. If Hillary wins he will just tell the agents to go F themselves and look for a another job if they don't like it, if Trump wins and Comey indicts Hillary after the election, the other agents will be pleased.
Hillary probably has something on Comey on which she could blackmail him with but it won't matter because IF he will do his job and arrest Hillary shortly after the election, Trump will be pleased and keep him on as the director.
James Comey would prefer Hillary to win though because that's why he didn't indict her during the first investigation, but he's gotta defend his ass by preparing for a different scenario, like a Trump victory so that's exactly why he reopened the investigation now.
Trump will win in a landslide and Comey will most likely be fine should he prove himself worthy before the election and actually do something.
Expect more of those two-faced people to come out and do the same in the next days. Expect event he likes of CNN, New York Times to stop bashing Trump as everyone will have to prepare for the possibility of a Trump victory, out of fear of a huge retribution in case they don't change. Remember those libel laws CNN?

Two earthquakes, which struck Italy this week, were 'retribution' for the country's support of the UNESCO resolution disregarding the Jewish connection to Jerusalem, Israeli Deputy Minister for Regional Cooperation Ayoob Kara said.
'I'm sure that the earthquake happened because of the UNESCO decision,' Kara, a member of the ruling Likud Party, wrote in a memo, Ynetnews website reported.
Ironically, the Israeli politician was on a state visit to the Vatican when the quakes hit central Italy on Wednesday, killing one and injuring 10 people.
Earlier the same day, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), passed a resolution criticizing Israel for its handling of the holy site in Jerusalem 'ì called Temple Mount by Jews, and Haram al-Sharif by Muslims.
The document was adopted after heated debate over its wording, and particularly the Arabic names used in the document. Italy was among the nations voting in favor of the resolution.
Israel blasted UNESCO and its Arab members for trying to undermine Jewish connections to the holy site.
Kara arrived in the Vatican in a fruitless effort to avert the resolution, but still managed to have a small chat with the leader of the Catholic Church.
According to Kara, Pope Francis 'strongly disagreed' with the resolution.
'He (the Pope) even said publicly that the holy land is connected to the Nation of Israel,' the deputy minister stressed.
As for surviving the natural disaster, the Israeli politician said that 'going through the earthquake was not the most comfortable of experiences, but we trusted that the Holy See would keep us safe.'

The #NeverTrump Republican candidate last week told reporters all Republicans are racist.
The #NeverTrump movement hopes McMullin will steal enough votes from Trump for Hillary to win Utah.
McMullin told reporters this week his goal is to take down Trump.
McMullin: What we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re trying to do is earn enough electoral votes is to block Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump'¶ If not they then we will be happy to have prevented someone who I believe is a true authoritarian from taking power in the United States and that's Donald Trump.
Now what is it will all those Democrats saying 'Trump is dangerous'? Dangerous to what? To their nest of corruption of course. Sure he is dangerous to that, they will go to jail most likely. Evan McMullin who looks like an E.T. with that ugly bold head of his used a different wording though, which is basically the same. He said he doesn't want a 'true authoritarian to take power in the US'. Umm sure he doesn't, he doesn't like the authority, the rule of law. Nope, he likes the rule of jungle where everybody can be corrupt in peace and be left alone.
According to his Wikipedia page, he is a former CIA operative who also worked at Goldman Sachs.
Those Democrats are so despicable. Its as if the USA fell in the hands of the organized Mafia.
Its obvious now this douchebag is a Hillary plant. Perhaps Republicans should have done something similar in California. Have some paid SJW agent trying to steal California away from the Democrats.

The US should stop brazenly blaming Russia for the situation in Syria as it may face an equally harsh response, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned at the Valdai forum in Sochi, also addressing American exceptionalism, Trump and other issues.
Does anyone seriously think that Russia can somehow influence the choice of the American people? Is America some sort of a banana republic? America is a great state. Correct me, please, if I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m wrong.
On the US media switching from portraying Trump as Russia√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s enemy to Kremlin√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s favorite:
This is complete and utter rubbish√¢‚Ç¨≈ö a way of manipulating the public consciousness ahead of the US presidential election
Simply watching airstrikes in the heart of Europe (in Yugoslavia) at the end of the 20th century, I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know about you, but for me √¢‚Ç¨' it felt like savagery.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States decided that there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no need to coordinate fundamental issues with anybody. And it all just went off'¶

In the aftermath of one of the most memorable (c)october shocks in presidential campaign history, Wikileaks continues its ongoing broadside attack against the Clinton campaign with the relentless Podesta dump, by unveiling another 596 emails in the latest Part 22 of its Podesta release, bringing the total emails released so far to exactly 36,190, leaving less than 30% of the total dump left to go.
As usual we will go parse through the disclosure and bring you some of the more notable ones.
* * *
In a February 2012 email from Chelsea Clinton's NYU alias, aj66@nyu.edu, to Podesta and Mills, Bill and Hillary's frustrated daughter once again points out the 'frustration and confusion' among Clinton Foundation clients in the aftermath of the previously noted scandals plaguing the Clinton consultancy, Teneo:
Over the past few days a few people from the Foundation have reached out to me frustrated or upset about (fill in the blank largely derived meetings Friday or Monday). I've responded to all w/ essentially the following (ie disintermediating myself, again, emphatically) below. I also called my Dad last night to tell him of my explicit non-involvement and pushing all back to you both and to him as I think that is indeed the right answer. Thanks
Sample: Please share any and all concerns, with examples, without pulling punches, with John and Cheryl as appropriate and also if you feel very strongly with my Dad directly. Transitions are always challenging and to get to the right answer its critical that voices are heard and understood, and in the most direct way 'ì ie to them without intermediation. Particularly in an effort to move more toward a professionalism and efficiency at the Foundation and for my father 'ì and they're the decision-makers, my Dad most of all.
A February 2015 email from Neera Tanden lashes out at David Brock of the Bonner Group, profiled in this post: ' Money Laundering Scheme Exposed: 14 Pro-Clinton Super PACs & Non-Profits Implicated. ' As a reminder, the Bonner Group, as we showed last month, may be a money laundering front involving various SuperPACs and non-profit institutions:

In the email Tanden says that:
'Brock/Bonner are a nightmare: Really, Suzie Buell isn't giving to the superpac? I wonder how that got in this story ' Big donors holding off making pledges to pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC ',
and concludes by saying that ' Sometimes HRC/WJC have the worst judgement. '

In retrospect, she is right.

Speaking of 'donor advisor' Mary Pat Bonner , the following email from March 2009 hints at potential impropriety in shifting money from one democratic donor group to another, the Center for American Progress :
I have moved all the sussman money from unity '09 to cap and am reviewing the others. I will assess it and keep you informed
Something else for the DOJ to look into after the elections, perhaps?
* * *
And then there is this email from August 2015 in which German politician Michael Werz advises John Podesta that Turkish president Erdogan 'is making substantial investments in U.S. to counter opposition (CHP, Kurds, Gulenists etc.) outreach to policymakers' and the US Government.
John, heard this second hand but more than once. Seems Erdogan faction is making substantial investments in U.S. to counter opposition (CHP, Kurds, Gulenists etc.) outreach to policymakers and USG. Am told that the Erdogan crew also tries to make inroads via donations to Democratic candidates, including yours. Two names that you should be aware of are *Mehmet Celebi* and *Ali Cinar*. Happy to elaborate on the phone, provided you are not shopping at the liquor store.
The email :

This should perhaps explain why the US has so far done absolutely nothing to halt Erdogan's unprecedented crackdown on 'coup plotters' which has seen as many as 100,000 workers lose their jobs, be arrested, or otherwise removed from Erdogan's political opposition.

Another astonishing Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that the Main Directorate for Migration Affairs (GUVM) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) reported this morning that former Clinton Foundation CEO Eric Braverman, who last week applied for 'urgent and immediate' political asylum at the Russian Embassy in New York City, failed to keep his scheduled interview yesterday'îwith speculation being made by Federation intelligence analysts that his having gone missing is 'directly related' to the mysterious and sudden death of Donald Trump's top money guru E. Lee Hennessee. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, Mr. Braverman was scheduled to return to the Russian Embassy in New York City yesterday for an in-depth interview related to the request he made last week for 'urgent and immediate' political asylum in Russia'îand as we had previously reported, sent shockwaves through the Kremlin as some Federation intelligence analysts believed his request was for the purpose of 'protection by publicity' due to his fears that the Clinton Crime Family wanted him killed.
Fears that he was being targeted for death by the Clinton Crime Family, specifically Hillary Clinton, this report continues, was due to Mr. Braverman's past association with the Clinton Foundation criminal money laundering organization that he headed as CEO after being installed there by Chelsea Clinton who discovered for herself the massive corruption of this supposed to be charity.
With the American press widely reporting (though skeptically) Mr. Braverman's asylum request ('a simple 'here I am' could quiet the waters 'ì but there has been none'), however, this report notes, Federation intelligence analysts contributing to this report note that not only did he fail to keep yesterday's interview date at the Russian Embassy in New York City, he has yet to publically deny his actions, and since 12 October has failed to even update his Twitter page account.
To why Mr. Braverman has gone silent and missing, this report continues, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is attributing to yet another Clinton Crime Family related mysterious death'îthis one being Donald Trump's longtime billionaire money guru E. Lee Hennessee, age 64, found dead this past week in her Trump Plaza home, located in West Palm Beach, Florida'îwith one media account suggesting it was related to a domestic harm case involving her husband and longtime business partner, and another saying she died of a stroke'îbut with no autopsy having yet been performed.
Donald Trump's money guru E. Lee Hennessee, this report explains, was one of the most powerful women financiers on Wall Street whose company, Hennessee Group LLC, achieved a staggering 2,132% increase of profits between 1987-2015 and was co-run by her husband Charles Gradante.
As to why Hillary Clinton feared and hated E. Lee Hennessee, this report says, is due to her having created for Donald Trump an 'extraordinary/unique' investment portfolio that, in essence, has allowed him to run his revolutionary presidential campaign entirely debt free costing him virtually nothing as for every dollar he spent, he was able to gain back two more'îthus making it the first US presidential election run in history to turn a profit.
With what is infamously called the Clinton Body Count rapidly increasing through this US presidential election cycle, this report concludes, there now appears to be a breaking of support of Hillary Clinton among America's elites, with even the Chicago Tribune this past week saying Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside as the American political system is breaking down and their warning that it's been crumbling for some time now, and the establishment elite know it and they're properly frightened'îand is most assuredly going to get worse with the shocking revelation that the FBI has now discovered a staggering 650,000 Hillary Clinton secret emails on the computer of her top aide Huma Abedin's disgraced pedophile husband Anthony Weiner.

Project Veritas Action has released the sixth video in a multi-part series that is sending shockwaves through the DNC and the Clinton campaign. In a new video released by Project Veritas Action, a PVA journalist exposes how his pay for play with Robert Creamer landed him a meeting with Bradley Beychock, the President of Media Matters For America, an organization that has been attacking James O'Keefe for years.
Bradley Beychock is first seen in the undercover video bragging how he is responsible for taking knowable conservative voices off TV stations with pressure campaigns: 'Lou Dobbs from CNN left now and he is on FOX Business, Glenn Beck off of FOX News.' So it seems that there is simply no tolerance and no room left for conservatism in the media, yet they claim the system isn't rigged? Of course its rigged!
During the meeting, Beychock gave the PVA journalist a tour of their offices. He also proudly boasted about the Media Matters assault on conservative writer and political consultant Roger Stone.
'So I think for Trump, our big role as a media watchdog has been to take his MVPs and put them on the sidelines. So the first one was Roger Stone,' said Beychock.
James O'Keefe interviewed Stone and showed him the footage, to which Stone responded.
Shortly after James O'Keefe and Roger Stone were interviewed together on Alex Jones's show, Media Matters put up the Alex Jones interview on their website.
Media Matters is funded by Clinton confidante George Soros.
Project Veritas Action Fund (AKA Project Veritas Action) was founded by James O'Keefe to investigate and expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud and other misconduct.

Democrat pollster Doug Schoen, who advised President Bill Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 1996 reelection campaign and worked on Hillary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s failed 2008 presidential bid, has withdrawn his endorsement of Hillary Clinton for the presidency following the renewal of the FBI investigation into Clinton and her her top aide Huma Abedin. Schoen said he fears a constitutional crisis should Clinton be elected and sworn into office while under investigation
Schoen made the announcement on the Fox News Channel Sunday night where he is a contributor. Video of the announcement was posted to Twitter.
(Transcribed by Kristinn Taylor.)
Shoen, √¢‚Ç¨≈ì√¢‚Ç¨¬ùI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been a supporter of Secretary Clinton.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù

Faulkner, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo matter who wins.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Schoen, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo matter who wins. But if the secretary of State (Clinton) wins we will have a president under criminal investigation with Huma Abedin under investigation, the secretary of State√¢‚Ç¨'the president-elect√¢‚Ç¨'should she win under investigation.

Schoen, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve known the Clintons since 1994.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Faulkner, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWow.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Schoen was on a panel with fellow Democrat pollster Pat Caddell and former Republican Congressman John LeBoutillier.
Schoen√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s bio reads in part:
Douglas E. Schoen has been one of the most influential Democratic campaign consultants for over thirty years. A founding partner and principle strategist for Penn, Schoen & Berland, he is widely recognized as one of the co-inventors of overnight polling.
Schoen was named Pollster of the Year in 1996 by the American Association of Political Consultants for his contributions to the President Bill Clinton reelection campaign.
His political clients include New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Indiana Governor Evan Bayh, and his corporate clients include AOL Time Warner, Procter & Gamble and AT&T. Internationally, he has worked for the heads of states of over 15 countries, including British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and three Israeli Prime Ministers'¶√¢‚Ç¨¬ù

A new Wikileaks email just exposed that Hillary Clinton loves to drink. This is coming from Wikileaks. In one telling line in a new WikiLeaks drop, John Podesta and communications aide Jennifer Palmieri are caught discussing whether to 'sober her up some.'
A new WikiLeaks email ID 25842 reveals that Hillary was boozed up until 4:30 in the afternoon.
'Should I call her and talk this through or better leave with you?' Podesta asked at 2 p.m. 'I'm worried she'll get on with Cheryl [Mills] and we'll end up in a bad place.'
Then Palmieri responds to Podesta:
' I think you should call her and sober her up some ', she said.
We need to get this out there! Even her own staff think that she is a drunk.
Check out this video below of Hillary Clinton drunk.
Hillary is not a good choice for President. She is not going to make it through the stress and the negotiations.
God bless Trump for standing up to this drunkard. Trump doesn't drink. Should we elect an alcoholic as president?

Shock report! 650,000 emails were found on Anthony Weiner's laptop that he shared with his wife Huma Abedin.
Abedin is Hillary Clinton's longtime personal assistant.
That's a lot of emails!
Zero Hedge reported:
Yesterday, we reported that the FBI has found ' tens of thousands of emails ' belonging to Huma Adein on Anthony Weiner's computer, raising questions how practical it is that any conclusive finding will be available or made by the FBI in the few days left before the elections
Now, according to the WSJ , it appears that Federal agents are preparing to scour roughly 650,000 emails that, as we reported moments ago were discovered weeks ago on the laptop of Anthony Weiner , to see how many relate to a prior probe of Hillary Clinton's email use, as metadata on the device suggests there may be thousands sent to or from the private server that the Democratic nominee used while she was secretary of state, according to people familiar with the matter.
As the WSJ adds, the review will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are work-relatedemails between Huma Abedin, a close Clinton aide and the estranged wife of Mr. Weiner, and State Department officials; how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the Clinton email probe, which FBI officials call 'Midyear.'
And, as we further reported earlier today , the FBI has had to await a court order to begin reviewing the emails, because they were uncovered in an unrelated probe of Mr. Weiner, and that order was delayed for reasons that remain unclear.
More stunning is just how many emails were found on Weiner's computer. And while one can only imagine the content of some of the more persona ones, the WSJ writes that the latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe, the bureau's second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a minor, they had recovered a laptop with 650,000 emails. Many, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter.
** One-Third of likely voters are less likely to vote for Hillary Clinton following the announcement of a new FBI criminal investigation.
Democrats are going psycho right now as they are in full panic mode. Expect ANYTHING from them now, BUT disregard and ignore any stunt they may pull. Remember this was a prophetic prediction and warning!

You may be wondering what the term 'black box' means. A 'black box' system is non-transparent; its functions are hidden from the public. Elections, of course, should not be black box systems.

CNN finally made it public that they have severed ties with DNC chair Donna Brazile after a new Wikileaks email revealed more CNN collusion with Clinton campaign after Donna Brazile gave Hillary Clinton a debate question in advance.
They fired her 2 weeks ago when Megyn Kelly first confronted her regarding another leak at a town hall. CNN kept it quiet that they fired Donna Brazile all this time up until a new leak revealed she provided another question to Hillary Clinton in advance for one of their debates.
CNN denied any involvement but the fact that they kept quiet for 2 weeks tells it all. The fact that this isn't the first collusion we discover tells it all, besides, how would Donna get the questions? Someone from CNN had to gave her the questions.
When FOX News's Megyn Kelly previously confronted Donna Brazile she denied any involvement, claimed some mumbo jumbo about the Russians, space aliens, UFOs, tinfoil hats and she even said that the Wikileaks email is fake. Now after facing huge pressure even from Clinton News Network (CNN), Donna has finally admitted that the emails are real and that she's at fault for the collusion.
Brazile thanked CNN for her time on the network.
Brazile tweeted this message around dinnertime Sunday night.
Brazile gave Clinton's senior advisers a heads-up on March 5 about a question she would be asked the next night during a debate against Bernie Sanders.
Brazile was on defense earlier this month when this WikiLeak-ed email showed her giving the Clinton campaign a CNN town hall question about the death penalty ahead of time.
UK's The Independent reported :
CNN has dropped a political commentator following accusations that she sent Hillary Clinton two questions ahead of time during the primary season.
Donna Brazile announced her departure on 31 October on twitter although she resigned two weeks ago .
Leaked emails from WikiLeaks belonging to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta showed that Ms Brazile funneled two questions to Ms Clinton, a longtime political ally, before a CNN-sponsored debate and voter town hall event against Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.

Billionaire venture capitalist and PayPal founder, Peter Thiel spoke at the National Press Club today on his support for Donald Trump.
Most of the media ignored the groundbreaking presser today.
They don't want Americans to know about this pro-Trump gay conservative from Silicon Valley.
FOX Business Network carried much of the speech live.
Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel took his pro-Trump message to the heart of the media establishment in a major speech at the National Press Club this morning.
'We're voting for Trump because we judge the leadership of this country to have failed,' Thiel said to an audience of about 150 members of the press.
'The insiders have been getting it wrong for a long time,' he added. Establishment politicians 'are just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.'
During the Q&A session, the moderator inquired about 'social blowback' Thiel has received for supporting Trump and dwelled heavily on Thiel's funding of the Hulk Hogan case that brought down Gawker.
Thiel justified funding the lawsuit against a Gawker that he described as a 'singular, sociopathic bully.' Defending illegal revenge porn under the guise of the First Amendment 'is an insult to journalists,' he noted.
That comment aroused a scowl in the reporter sitting next to me, who walked out shortly after.
The room was full of about 150 journalists, mostly from mainstream publications. There was a row of cameras filming the event, but only two reporters appeared to be streaming it live through Periscope and Facebook Live. National Press Club Executive Director William C. McCarren treated several members of the press brusquely as they tried to enter the event.
The event highlighted the growing gulf between the establishment and the rest of the country, the mainstream press versus the independent press, and the truth of what's seen from direct sources and how mainstream reporters often spin it.
At one point during the speech, Thiel directly pointed out the hoaxing and bias within the media. 'The Advocate, a magazine which once praised me as a 'gay innovator,' published an article saying that as of now I am, and I quote, 'not a gay man,' because I don't agree with their politics.'
When a high-profile, highly intelligent figure like Thiel supports Trump, who cares about the truth?

A former assistant FBI Director has slammed Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, saying that it is a 'cesspool' and that the family is like an organized crime syndicate.
Appearing on a John Catsimatidis' radio show in the wake of the FBI reopening the case into Hillary Clinton's home brew email server, James Kallstrom made the remarks while praising GOP nominee Donald Trump as a 'good human being' and a 'patriot'.
'The Clintons, that's a crime family, basically,' Kallstrom, a 27 year FBI veteran, said. 'It's like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool.'
'God forbid we put someone like that in the White House,' he added, referring to Hillary.
Kallstrom, a who was assistant Director of the FBI in charge of the New York office during the 1990s, knows all about crime families, having tracked down mobsters, and swindlers for years.
'It's just outrageous how Hillary Clinton sold her office for money.' Kallstrom said.
The former FBI official, perhaps most well known for his criminal inquiry into the downing of Trans World Airlines Flight 800, said of Hillary 'she's a pathological liar, and she's always been a liar.'
Referring specifically to the FBI investigation into her email server, Kallstrom said 'The problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation.'
'That's the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I'm sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.' he added, referring to the Attorney General.
'So this investigation was without the ability to serve subpoenas, serve search warrants, and obtain the evidence that they ended up begging for. It was just ludicrous what went on.' Kallstrom added, noting that theFBI 'left so much stuff on the table'.
Kallstrom also noted that FBI Director James Comey and the rest of the top brass at the bureau were directly responsible for holding back the investigation.
'The agents are furious with what's going on, I know that for a fact,' he said.
On Friday Kallstrom stated that he thinks 'something big is going to happen' in the coming days, and that Comey 'couldn't hold onto it any longer' and had to reopen the investigation because had he not, 'the locals would have stepped in,' meaning the regular FBI agents who have seen the bombshell evidence against Clinton.
The full interview can be viewed here .
The Washington Post also reported Monday that regular FBI agents have been pushing hard for the Clinton Foundation to be investigated over claims it gave favors and special access to donors.
The report notes that it was the Justice Department that shut down the line of inquiry into the foundation.

CNN (also known as the Clinton News Network) has gone out of its way to try to rig the election for Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton this year. It hasn't even tried to hide its bias in an attempt to destroy Republican nominee Donald Trump's chances at becoming president.
Over the weekend, CNN tried desperately to find anything it could to distract the American people from the FBI's announcement that it was reopening the investigation into Clinton's use of an email server while she was secretary of state.
CNN ran a story on Sunday about a Trump rally in Colorado, only it blatantly lied about what Trump said at the rally in an attempt to smear him, Mediate reported .
The article in question originally ran with the headline 'Trump, skeptical of mail-in balloting, encourages voting more than once if necessary.' Here's a screen grab of the original.
'If you go to university center, they'll give you a new ballot, they'll void your old ballot, in some places they do that four or five times, so by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in,' Trump said at the rally, according to CNN's original article.
However there was more to that quote, which CNN decided not to run with.
'If you go to university center, they'll give you a new ballot, they'll void your old ballot. They'll give you a new ballot, and you can go out and make sure it get's in. Now in some places, they do that four or five times, but we don't do that. So by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in,' is the full quote of what Trump said.
By selectively editing the quote, CNN made it appear that Trump was encouraging voter fraud.
After publishing the original story, CNN changed the headline, and the content, to actually reflect what Trump actually said. Initially, the network did not indicate it had done so. However, a line was later added at the end of the article to indicate it had been changed.
The new headline can be seen below:

CNN also took down the tweet that had the incorrect headline.
Maybe next time CNN will think twice before publishing such blatant lies. Instead of trying to cover up Clinton's corruption, maybe the network should just to its job and report on the news.
This is what the media is doing these days, they chop speeches, edit them, falsify them! Let this be a warning to you for any future BS that may come out from the media. No matter how much they hype it. Do NOT believe anything the media tells you!
You know what you have to do, go out and vote for Trump! Avoid electronic voting because the machines are owned by George Soros, a Clinton donor, request paper ballot because they are obligated by the law and if they refuse to give you a paper ballot, make a scene, call the cops on them.

In today's, 25th, Wikileaks release of hacked Podesta emails, one of the notable highlights is a March 2, 2015 exchange between John Podesta and Clinton aide Cheryl Mills in which the Clinton Campaign Chair says ' On another matter'¶.and not to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails. '
Back in July 2016, FBI didn't go after Hillary because director Comey said 'didn't find any intent'. Well here's your 'intent' thanks to Wikileaks.
The email, which may indicate intent, was sent at the same time as the NYT story ' Hillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Dept., Possibly Breaking Rules ' 'ì which for the first time revealed the existence of Hillary's email server 'ì hit, and just days before Hillary's press conference addressing what was at the time, the stunning revelation that she had a personal email account, and server, in her home.
The proposed 'dumping' on March 2 takes place two days before the House Select Committee on Benghazi sent Hillary Clinton a document retention subpoena on March 4, 2015, with some hinting the NYT report may have served to tip off the Clinton campaign about the upcoming subpoena.
Mills' response to Podesta: 'Think you just got your new nick name.'
It is unclear which 'Lanny' is referred to: the infamous former DOJ staffer Lanny Breuer who quit in January 2013 after telling Frontline that some banks are too big to fail, or, more likely Lanny Davis, special counsel to President Bill Clinton, and spokesperson for the President and the White House on matters concerning campaign-finance investigations and other legal issues
It is also unclear 'ì for now 'ì which emails Podesta is referring to in the thread, but Podesta adds: 'better to do so sooner than later.' We can hope that a subsequent response, yet to be leaked by Wikileaks, will provide more color.
If the exchange is shown to disclose intent to mislead, it will negate the entire narrative prepared by Clinton that she merely deleted 'personal' emails and will reveal a strategic plan to hinder the State Department and FBI 'investigation.'
This is the first time that particular exchange has emerged among the Podesta emails.
Furthermore, a search for Lanny Davis reveals the following curious exchange between Robby Mook and John Podesta from March 8, 2015, just days after the abovementioned exchange, in which Mook says:
We gotta zap Lanny out of our universe. Can't believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV.
It seems the Clinton campaign was not happy with being set on a course of transparency by Bill Clinton's special counsel.
Finally, in a separate email sent out in the first week of March 2015 , by Clinton campaign communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, we get yet another confirmation that the president actively mislead the public when he said he didn't know Hillary was using a private email address:
Suggest Philippe talk to Josh or Eric. They know POTUS and HRC emailed. Josh has been asked about that. Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm. I recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinet's email addresses.
Perhaps while the DOJ/FBI is taking a second look into Huma Abedin's emails, it can also take a repeat look at some of these, especially the ones involving POTUS.

Internet security expert Kim Dotcom says that Hillary Clinton is in 'serious trouble,' with new information set to leak that some speculate could be a Wikileaks release of Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails.
'There's unpublished material, yet to come out. Clinton is in serious trouble,' the Megaupload founder tweeted last night.
Kim Dotcom's promise is worthy of attention given his long standing relationship with Wikileaks and Julian Assange. During an interview with Bloomberg in May 2015, Dotcom (real name Kim Schmitz) acknowledged, 'I love to talk to them'.
He also predicted that Julian Assange would be Hillary's worst nightmare in 2016 'because he has access to information,' a forecast that very much came true.

There's unpublished material, yet to come out. Clinton is in serious trouble.
'î Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) November 1, 2016 

This is not the first time that the entrepreneur's tweets have prompted speculation to swirl. Schmitz has hinted on a number of occasions that Wikileaks is in possession of Hillary Clinton's 33,000 missing emails.
Last week, Schmitz tweeted at Wikileaks with a video of himself reacting to 'you've got mail' audio. Hours before, he also sent out another tweet which stated, 'Bleachbit(ch) can't bleach it,' a reference to the software tool used by Hillary to hide traces of her deleted emails.
'I know where Hillary Clintons deleted emails are and how to get them legally,' Schmitz tweeted on October 27, adding that they 'are all stored in the NSA spy cloud in Utah.'

As far back as December 2014, Schmitz also tweeted that he was 'Hillary's worst nightmare in 2016!'
Radio host Rush Limbaugh picked up on the issue during his radio show on Friday, speculating that Kim Dotcom could have been the hacker that handed Hillary's deleted emails to Wikileaks.
'In all of these Podesta emails there's not a single Hillary Clinton email in the bunch, if you have noticed. It's Podesta emailing everybody, the DNC, everybody in the Hillary campaign, but there are no Hillary Clinton emails in this Podesta dump,' said Limbaugh.
'Along comes Kim Dotcom who's got an axe to grind with the U.S. government, the Obama administration. He knows Assange. So the people 'î nobody knows 'î this is all speculation. What's going on here is that Kim Dotcom has worked with Assange and is really the hacker. It's not the Russians,' he added.
Is Kim Dotcom working with Wikileaks to release Hillary's 33,000 deleted emails right before the election?
If it's going to happen, it has to happen this week.

A very sobering Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that the Federation has been officially notified by the United States North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) that their military forces are now on ' Sustained Alert Status ' due to unspecified threats directly related to their upcoming 8 November presidential election. [ Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, under the protocol and procedures outlined in the New Start Treaty that came into force on 5 February 2011 between the Federation and the United States, one of the obligations of the signing parties to reduce the risk of war is a notification process to take place when ' aberrations/sudden changes ' (departure from normal) are made'îand that occurred this past week when NORAD unexpectedly expanded its 17-21 October air defense exercises with Canada to now include the California region where just yesterday US warplanes conducted what they call ' security exercises '.
As to the American's ' explanation/reasons ' for expanding the use of their warplanes over the continental United States (CONUS) with no foreign threat being known, this report explains, the Pentagon explained as being a ' National Special Security Event ' due to unspecified threats being posed to the national leadership of the US government and directly related to their presidential election.
Deputy Defense Minister Tatiana Shevtsova , however, and shockingly, writes in this report that the American government is currently undergoing a ' silent coup ' pitting forces loyal to President Obama against those aligned with Hillary Clinton'îwho was the former disgraced US Secretary of State and is facing an estimated 20 year prison sentence for obstruction justice and who, also, is being ' closed in upon ' by Obama's Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) who have launched a staggering 5 different criminal investigations against her and everyone of her inner circle .
Deputy Minister Shevtsova further notes in this MoD report that the vast criminality of Hillary Clinton, and everyone associated with her, has been so exposed to the American public that President Obama's greatest fear now is that even if she were able to be elected, she could singlehandedly destroy the Democratic Party for decades to come'îan observation, curiously, supported by American experts who believe the same .
Equally to be as feared by the Obama regime as Hillary Clinton, this report continues, is her campaign chairman John Podesta who is described as being adept at earning extraordinary sums of money via selling out the American public , and who Wikileaks revealed yesterday gave the order to destroy all of Hillary Clinton's emails that were under subpoena by the US Congress and that a US Federal Judge had, likewise, ordered to be returned to the US State Department.
With London's Guardian News Service having gone through all of Podesta's Wikileaks released emails , this report notes, even this far-leftist publication has been appalled at the level of corruption of Hillary Clinton and all who surround her'îand who wrote yesterday that the level of criminality surrounding Hillary Clinton ' points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else '.
As the six biggest US-based corporations supporting Hillary Clinton control some 90% of tens of thousands media outlets, including television channels, newspapers, magazines, radio stations and online editions (which means that the US media market is monopolized to a great extent and alternative outlets cannot be accessed in many towns), this report continues, the American people have awoken to the fact that their nation has fallen to 41 st out of 180 countries in the latest Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index to both their shame and amazement of what their criminal elites have done to them.
And in the American peoples ' response/reaction ' to the horrors that their Hillary Clinton supporting criminal elite class has put them through, this report notes, they are even now massively rejecting the manipulation of polling data designed to keep them from voting 'îand have, also, reacted in horror to YouTube, yesterday, censoring a Wall Street Journal video telling these people how they are being lied to and deceived.
With more empirical evidence showing Donald Trump is poised to win next weeks US presidential election in a landslide , and the Obama regime itself now turning against Hillary Clinton , this report grimly concludes, anyone believing that Hillary Clinton and her desperate criminal forces won't strike back to retake control of America would be gravely mistaken'îand the worst may be yet to come.

In a truly shocking twist, the Supreme Court of Austria has decided to acquit the Iraqi man, 'that may not have realised the 10-year-old Austrian boy did not want to be sexually abused by him.' Amir, 20, was visiting the Theresienbad pool in the Austrian capital of Vienna in December 2015, as part of a trip to encourage integration, when the rape incident occurred.
Europe, if you can't stand up for your children, who will? Of course there is the fact that Western Europe has supported the US in their violent destruction of the Middle East over the past 20 years. Is it a guilty conscience that seems to appease the blatant criminal activity on behalf of some newcomers? Or are they George Soros puppets implanted into the judicial system that are at work?
Russia is a multicultural and multi-religious society, and has been for 1000 years. The law applies to everyone equally 'ì whether you're a Crimean Tatar or a Slavic Russian 'ì every Russian citizen is 'native' as such and subject to the same protocols.
A migrant has just raped a child in one of the European countries. The court found him 'NOT GUILTY' based on two things: the migrant did not understand the language of his host country, and he did not understand that the boy 'ì and it was a boy 'ì didn't want this.
Vladimir Putin was outraged when he heard about the incident and here's what he had to say:
It doesn't fit into my head what on Earth they're thinking over there. This is the result of the dilution of national values [identity].
I can't even explain the rationale 'ì is it a sense of guilt before the migrants? What's going on? It's not clear.
But a society that cannot defend its children today has no tomorrow. It has no future.
So relying on their [migration policy] experience is not the best thing to do, if I can be frank.
But we have a 1000 year history of forming a multicultural society 'ì our understanding of [these intricacies] is much deeper.

In the video, prominent Ross donor Benjamin Barber expresses his opinion about blacks who vote Republican by comparing them to Nazis.
'Have you heard of the Sonderkommandos? Jewish guards who helped murder Jews in the camps. So there were even Jews that were helping the Nazis murder Jews! So blacks who are helping the other side are seriously fucked in the head. They're only helping the enemy who will destroy them.

FBI officials say their investigation into links between US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Russia has been unable to uncover any so far, according to the New York Times.
The bureau has been trying to find evidence showing that the Russian government is trying to influence the US presidential campaign since the beginning of summer. FBI agents have put advisers close to GOP candidate Donald Trump under close scrutiny, searching for financial connections that some have alleged exist between the nominee and Russian financial figures. They even followed up on a lead hinting that there had been a secret email correspondence between Trump√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Organization and Russia√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Alfa-bank. All the while, the bureau has been searching for the hackers that breached the computers of the Democratic camp and leaked emails that became the source of many scandals damaging to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s campaign.
Nonetheless, the FBI still cannot say that any of its investigations have uncovered direct links between Trump and Russian authorities, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing recent interviews and its own bureau sources.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo evidence has emerged that would link [Trump] or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russia√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s election operations,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù writes the NYT.
Officials also anonymously told the NYT that whoever the hackers were, the attacks were aimed at disrupting the presidential race on the whole, and not boosting Trump√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s chances of getting into the Oval Office, as the Western media and Democrats have been claiming.
In explaining why Russia would want to interfere in the campaign, one senior official was cited as saying, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t about the election√¢‚Ç¨≈ö It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s about a threat to democracy.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
The FBI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s inquiries will continue, however. In interviews over the past several weeks, intelligence officials have signaled that they have opened a larger probe to look into suspicions over connections between Trump aides and Moscow.
In the most recent lead, an anonymous computer scientist going by the name Tea Leaves found some 2,700 √¢‚Ç¨≈ìlook-up√¢‚Ç¨¬ù messages that tied a server being used by one of Donald Trump√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s companies to those of Russia√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Alfa Bank.
Still, the FBI found that there was no two-way communication, and these messages could have been marketing emails or spam. Both the Trump campaign and Alfa Bank issued statements denying that they had been in communication.

The FBI is also probing Trump√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, whose foreign business and political dealings have come under scrutiny since reports surfaced claiming he was involved with a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine, NBC reported, citing intelligence sources.
√¢‚Ç¨ÀúRussia hacking√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ vs Clinton emails 
A separate report from CNBC citing a former FBI official claims that the bureau√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s director, James Comey, was privately reluctant about naming Russia as the entity responsible for meddling in the US election campaign, reportedly saying it was too close to the November 8 Election Day.
In the beginning of October, Comey allegedly concluded that √¢‚Ç¨≈ìa foreign power was trying to undermine the election,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù but arguing against putting it out before the election itself.
He also allegedly made sure that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was not mentioned in the document compiled by the US government on October 7, which officially accused Russia of √¢‚Ç¨≈ìauthorizing√¢‚Ç¨¬ù the hacking of emails accounts of US officials and organizations, out of concern that the FBI would be seen as interfering with the election if it was included.
However, last Friday, with the election mere days away, Comey announced that the bureau was reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton because several hundred thousand new emails that may be related to the private server used by the Democratic nominee had allegedly been discovered.
The announcement, which left many in the government puzzled, has already resulted in official complaints and attacks from the entire US political spectrum. On Monday, some 100 former federal prosecutors and senior Department of Justice officials, including Attorney General Eric Holder, signed a letter expressing concern over Comey√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s decision to reopen the case √¢‚Ç¨≈ìon the eve of a major election,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù as √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthe mere disclosure of information may impact the election√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s outcome√¢‚Ç¨¬ù at this stage.
Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s supporters have accused Comey of deliberately hiding √¢‚Ç¨≈ìexplosive√¢‚Ç¨¬ù information about Trump√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s alleged ties to Russia, demanding that he discuss them publicly, just as he did with the new batch of Clinton-related emails.
Hillary Clinton and her supporters have repeatedly criticized Trump for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, while Trump has retorted that he has √¢‚Ç¨≈ìnothing to do√¢‚Ç¨¬ù with Russia and doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know its leader personally.
Putin on accusations of meddling: √¢‚Ç¨Àúrubbish√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 
Russia, in turn, has denied having any links to the Trump camp on numerous occasions, while refuting accusations that it had been behind the hacking attacks on the Democrats, with Russian President Vladimir Putin calling them √¢‚Ç¨≈ìrubbish√¢‚Ç¨¬ù last week.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe image [that Russia supports a candidate in the US presidential election] was created by the media,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Putin said at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi last Thursday, stressing that this had been done deliberately.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThis is complete and utter rubbish, and it is just a method of internal political struggle, as well as a way of manipulating the public consciousness ahead of the US presidential elections,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù he added, while explaining that Russia does not prefer any particular candidate and is ready to work with either of them. Russia√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s president also stressed that friendly words and intentions to normalize relations between the US and Russia are always welcome, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwhoever expresses them.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù

Everybody always knew Gary Johnson is kind of crazy but what he just did to a Guardian reporter who interviewed him a few days ago, may cause you to pee yourself laughing!
Well he didn't really try to bite the reporter, the title its more of a joke to amplify what you are about to see next but be warned, first empty your bladder!
If everyone voting for Gary Johnson saw this video, I promise you they would ALL change their mind. The man is a zombie, literally, watch his facial expressions.
I have honestly NEVER seen someone flip out like this. The first 20 seconds Gary Johnson has his neck veins inflated and all angered up, screams like a zombie, then, he admits to the reporter that he's an idiot:
'Well I'm an idiot, you know?? Really! I'm the dumbest guy you ever met in your whole life!'
Paul Lewis, the reporter looks stunned and for a while there, doesn't know how to react to his open admission of being a dumb idiot, but finally the reporter snaps out of it and says 'I'm trying to work out if that's sarcasm.'
Guess what Gary Johnson said'¶ 'It is'¶ I hope it's sarcasm'. So he's not sure if he's really a dumb idiot or he is just being sarcastic. He hopes'¶ then he says 'How do you respond when you're being called a dummy? I'm not a dummy, I'm n t! And yeah I'm human!' Are you sure there Gary? Or you're just hoping again? Well that's it! That's how you answer when someone calls you a dummy: 'I'm not a dummy, I'm n t! And yeah I'm human!' Paul Lewis looks stunned as if he was expecting a more complex answer'¶
Then for a few minutes or so Gary Johnson is cordial, even polite and even exposes Utah's Evan McMullin as a Hillary Clinton shill, who has recently officially endorsed Hillary Clinton and admitted that he's just a shill . Paul Lewis asked Gary why is he doing so poorly in the pools. Gary insisted that he's doing fantastic and that he is at 24% in New Mexico.
The reporter then asked Gary, 'Then why is Evan McMullin currently tied with Clinton and Trump in Utah?' Gary Johnson responded: 'Well he's from Utah, he's on the ballot in 11 states, so he can't win the presidency, ummm he's a Utahan. He's ensuring that Hillary Clinton will win Utah and you know what? He is what he is, and you know I hold no grudge on anyone for entering the race'¶ Look you ask me, I'm not labeling it spoiler, I'm just telling you what I think the reality is.'
Then SUDDENLY out of NOWHERE, he flips and goes ABSOLUTELY BATS#IT CRAZY AGAIN when he's asked about taxes.
Watch MENTALLY ILL Gary Johnson EXPLODE! But don't go, scroll down to laugh even harder!

We've just discovered that taking screenshots of Gary Johnson while he's in crazy mode and at the right moment is an art! Here's a couple of perfectly timed screenshots for you:

The Libertarian Party has been shooting itself in the foot since the beginning with large amounts of misstatements, judgement errors and wrong policies, but now they finally decided to shoot themselves in the head.
What Libertarian VP Bill Weld just did, is going to destroy and bury the Libertarian Party forever. There is no going back from this one.
I mean, WHAT IS ALEPPO??? , I guess I'm having an Aleppo moment (when being asked to name a single foreign leader), sticking his tongue at a woman who interviewed him , having mental collapse reactions on camera , are imbecilic errors which some followers could forgive but no one can forgive this one.
So this is what the Libertarian movement was all about. Total stupidity, betrayal and cuckoldry!
Ron Paul, chief Libertarian cuckold whom we strongly supported back in the past (and you can search and look at our older 2008-2012 articles as proof that we actually DID strongly supported him) endorsed the Libertarian Party first on CNN and then on FOX Business clowns Bill Weld and Gary Johnson who threw a George Washington gun replica in the garbage , pledged to sign TPP , open borders plus many others and now this, clown number 2: Bill Weld directly endorsing Hillary Clinton.
Libertarian vice presidential candidate Bill Weld is under fire from members of his own party and from GOP after espousing support for Democrat presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. Appearing on MSNBC's The Rachel Madcow Show Tuesday, Weld told Libertarian voters in the battleground state of North Carolina to instead give their vote to Hillary, claiming 'Donald Trump is a threat to the country'. Sure he is! He's a THREAT to corruption and that's exactly why the people want him.
'We are making our case that we're fiscally responsible and socially inclusive and welcoming and we think we got on the merits the best ticket of the three parties if you will. And so we'd like to get there.'
'Having said that as I think you're aware I see a big difference between the R candidate and the D candidate and I've been at some pains to say that I fear for the country if Mr. Trump should be elected. I think it's a candidacy without any parallel that I can recall. It's content-free and very much given to stirring up envy and resentment and even hatred. I think it would be a threat to the conduct of our foreign policy and our position in the world at large.'
Stating voters in North Carolina may decide the outcome of the 2016 election, Madcow asked why a Libertarian voter fearing Trump should vote for Hillary rather than Weld and his running mate Gary Johnson.
'I'm here vouching for Mrs. Clinton,' Weld told Maddow, 'and I think it's high time somebody did.'
Earlier this year, Weld said he would dedicate remaining efforts in the campaign toward staving off a Trump presidency.
'The libertarians are reaching levels of cuckoldry never thought possible,' writes Chris Menahan for Information Liberation .
After this one, the Libertarian movement is DEAD, the very heads of the Libertarian movement, Ron Paul, Gary Johnson and Bill Weld killed the movement! Libertarians are disgusting cucks who like to watch their wives getting kissed by other men (censored version). And this is exactly what they are, cucks! Just watch the photo above, who in the world names their WI-FI 'Cuckoo'??? They even spelled WI-FI 'Wifi' with small letters and no minus line. Someone who would read it fast without paying too much attention, could end up reading 'Wife: Cuckold'. You can't make this stuff up!
They like to watch the Constitution, morality, ethics, principles being screwed by Hillary Clinton!
Libertarians/cuckservatives: muh principles!
We, the EU Times: Well what's your principles?
Libertarians/cuckservatives: Open borders, TPP, destruction of 2nd Amendment, Christian oppression and Muslim immigration, pro-abortion, outsourcing of jobs, not standing up to government corruption and vote rigging! Define those principles of yours you cuckolds!
Ron Paul is a disgrace for supporting this cuckoldry! We disavow Ron Paul and we SPIT on all his previous work! We regret ever supporting him! Ron Paul got himself rich with millions of dollars in grassroots donations and when they stole votes from him (and they did steal from Ron Paul) the weakling cuck that he is didn't had the courage to stand up to himself and to his voters and say or do something. He's a snake just as bad as Ted Cruz and Glenn Beck!
The Libertarians are DEAD, Long live the Nationalists! Thanks to Trump, we now have a better, improved movement, more authentic and principled than ever before!
Here's principled libertarian Bill Weld endorsing Hillary Clinton:

A WikiLeak's email released on Monday reveals Clinton staffers knew as early as 2011 that Anthony Weiner had been messaging an underage girl but chose to take no action.
In June of 2011, John Podesta, chair of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign 'ì received news of an investigation into Weiner's online contact with a 17-year-old Delaware high school student.
The email , sent by Jennifer Palmieri, the current Clinton campaign communications director, detailed lurid claims of private messages to an underage girl being investigated by police. Now it is only LOGICAL to say that if these people knew, Hillary Clinton knew as well.
Podesta's reaction suggested he was undisturbed by the news. He replied to the email, 'Oof.'
Palmieri's email also included snippets of a Fox News report at the time, saying police were investigating Weiner's communication with the girl.
'Police on Friday afternoon came to the home of a 17-year-old high school junior to ask her about direct online communications she has had with Rep. Anthony Weiner,' the Fox News article said.
Sources close to the 17-year-old at the time told Fox News that the girl and Weiner had direct-messaged each other on Twitter.
The girl openly expressed her feelings for the disgraced congressman, who followed her on Twitter. She also expressed her affinity for married men, according to Patterico.com .
At the time, Wiener was married to Huma Abedin, Clinton's confidante and vice chairwoman, who is now a centerpiece of a fresh FBI investigation into the handling of classified material while Clinton was in office.
The scandal was one of many committed by the former congressman, whose return to the public eye has infuriated Democrats .
On Sunday, FBI Director James Comey announced that the FBI was re-opening its investigation into Clinton's private email server, having discovered new emails that 'appear to be pertinent.'
Weiner is at the center of the investigation, along with his estranged wife, Abedin. Law enforcement officials told The New York Times that the emails were uncovered after the FBI seized devices belonging to Abedin.
Comey has come under fire for his decision, but he has vigorously defended the integrity of the probe.
'You can call us wrong, but don't call us weasels. We are not weasels,' Comey said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing in September. 'We are honest people, and whether or not you agree with the result, this was done the way you want it to be done.'
Clinton has demanded the FBI 'come clean' with more specifics, and some Democrats have gone as far as to accuse Comey of interfering with the election and violating the Hatch Act .
'We're not going to be distracted, no matter what our opponents throw at us,' Clinton told a Florida rally.
Abedin separated from Weiner in August after it emerged that he was exchanging lewd messages with a woman on social media. Such behavior had destroyed his congressional career and his 2013 mayoral campaign.

The US and NATO are building up their offensive capabilities on the Western borders of Russia and its ally Belarus, prompting Moscow to take reciprocal measures, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu told the two countries' top military brass.
'Those actions undermine strategic stability and are forcing Russia to take reciprocal defensive measures, including some in the Western theatre,' the defense minister said.
NATO 'has not abandoned attempts to dictate its will to other countries through economic and political means, as well as by military force,' he said, noting that 'an information war is in full swing.'
Confronted with a complex security environment, Russia and Belarus will join forces to strengthen their mutual security, Shoigu added.
'Advanced bilateral cooperation and a common stance on major global and regional security challenges allow us to successfully tackle strengthening our defense capabilities,' he stressed, adding that this approach appears to be necessary at this point, 'as international crisis response mechanisms have stalled, while hotspots are already near our borders.'
In order to address the security challenges, Russia is now supplying state-of-the-art armaments and weapons systems to the army units guarding the Western borders, as well as ramping up combat training for the troops, the Defense Minister said.
Russian and Belarusian militaries are constantly working on improving their interoperability and the capacity to act in large troops formations, he added.
The remarks come amid NATO's biggest military buildup in Eastern Europe since the Cold War. The deployment will see up to 4,000 troops deployed in the Baltic countries and Poland, in addition to the more than 1,000 soldiers already stationed there on a 'rotational basis.'
A German-led battalion will deploy in Lithuania, the US will send troops to Poland, Canada is expected to station troops in Latvia, and the UK will deploy an 800-strong battle group in Estonia.
British Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon claimed in a bellicose op-ed appearing in the Wall Street Journal on Saturday that Europe 'is our continent' and, as such, it will be defended by a 'fully combat-capable' force.
Earlier this year, NATO staged several multinational war games, the largest of which was Anaconda 2016. Those exercises saw more than 31,000 personnel from 24 NATO and 'partner' countries taking part, reportedly in order to develop their capacity to 'deploy, mass and sustain combat power' against a near-peer adversary.
In June, Ukraine, a non-NATO state, hosted the Rapid Trident 2016 exercise, which featured over 1,800 soldiers from 14 countries, along with dozens of combat vehicles, aircraft, and heavy weaponry. That drill was said to be the largest multinational war games ever to be held in Ukraine.
Most recently, 680 troops from 32 NATO and non-NATO states, including Georgia, Albania, Israel and Ukraine, took part in war games called Crna Gora 2016 in the Balkan country of Montenegro, where they trained for 'disaster relief operations' in a series of joint exercises.
Moscow has consistently warned that the buildup does nothing to improve European security and is nothing but a 'projection of force.'
NATO members 'are fulfilling their confrontational schemes of military planning and military preparations in the territories along our borders,' Russia's envoy to NATO, Aleksandr Grushko, said on Monday.
'So, a question arises: What's next? A new wave of NATO speculation about a 'Russian threat' and a new arms race?' the diplomat added. 'We believe this is a road to nowhere.'

The liberal media is going bat$hit crazy over David Duke participating in Louisiana senate debate. BLM holds massive riot, attack police officers and damage their cars.
David Duke is a former Imperial grand dragon, wizard, sorcerer, magician cyclops of the knights of KKK and whatever you want to call him but what the bat$hit media is always conveniently forgetting to mention about him is that he is also a former Republican State Representative from 1989 to 1992 who reformed the party.
According to an online poll hosted by FOX 8 , the channel which hosted the debate, David Duke won the debate in a landslide. 92% of the respondents voted for David Duke but could this poll be accurate? Certainly NOT! David Duke has a lot of national support among his wizard circles while no one heard of the other 5 candidates outside of Louisiana. So his supporters rushed in to vote, but does he have any real authentic support in Louisiana? Yes, he has at least 5% state-wide support since he participated in the debate because you need at least 5 points in Louisiana state polls in order to qualify for the debates.

David Duke is associated with the devil across America so people naturally avoid admitting to support him in public polls so it is only logical to assume that his actual numbers may be more than double. This is a phenomenon now known as 'the shy voter'. Donald Trump suffers with the same phenomenon. When you see his polls out there. Those are only the known voters. There are many more voters who avoid publicly admitting that they support Donald Trump out of fear of repercussions from tolerant lefties.
If you have no idea who David Duke is, MSNBC of all TV stations out there did a quite fair description of him. He is a cutting edge politician whose ideas were stolen by establishment politicians, even top Democrats such as Bill Clinton, then claimed it were their ideas. Chris Hayes described David Duke as 'The Duke Effect', admitting that his ideas and policies were stolen by other politicians, such as: repealing affirmative action programs, stricter public housing guidelines, eliminating minority set-asides, welfare.
Philip Bump who was the guest at 'All In With Chris Hayes' said that Duke's fight from 1991 over welfare which evolved into a centrist position for Bill Clinton.
Chris Hayes said 'He's leading the edge over of the kind of political discourse that takes the country in a certain direction, not single-handedly.'

The former KKK wizard/magician/dragon/knight/snake/sorcerer, alright let's be fair to him'¶ the former Representative was definitely the most dominant figure in the debate and he stood his ground after Ted Cruz slandered him saying that he scammed his supporters.
John Neely Kennedy who is a former Democrat and who looks like and even sounds like he's Ted Cruz's lost twin brother, accused David Duke of being a convicted felon who went to prison for: 'lying to his supporters, he swindled them out of their money and took that money and used it for his gambling addiction'.
Duke wanted to respond and the moderator granted him 15 seconds which is definitely not enough for ANY of the candidates to rebuke an attack but, after just 12 seconds the moderator interrupted Duke and jumped in to help Ted Cruz! Sorry, John Neely Kennedy!
The moderator interrupted Duke and supported John Neely Cruz's accusations. After that, a full scandal broke out during the debate. The moderator saw that he was not going to back down so he finally decided to let him answer. Duke waved some papers in the air and said that he was audited and he actually overpaid his taxes by $6000 and that he was targeted because of his extreme political views.
We measured his second response time which he earned after being interrupted in the first place and it was a 40 seconds answer. Definitely over the allocated 15 seconds but the moderator preferred to create a scandal worth of 1 minute and 22 seconds instead of letting him answer the first time. Definitely some bias there, BUT after this incident/fight/scandal, the moderator was very fair and unbiased.
His supporters think that the moderator was also biased because of asking Duke about Trump's pus*y tape and why he condemn 'The CNN Jews'. Well the question was definitely legitimate since David Duke does spend a lot of time focusing on 'The Jews' which is the reason he never gained any serious traction. Not because that 'The Jews' don't have any power, on the contrary, they do own CNN actually, from top to bottom, but because the average American doesn't know and doesn't care about that. The average American cares about paying lower taxes, having a strong military and a strong border and David Duke should focus more on those things if he really cares about what white people want/need and if he wants to achieve more in his political career.
Aside for the 1 minute scandal there was also a funny moment during the debate, when they were talking about Social Security which is seen in the video below, at exactly minute 40 when Democrat candidate Foster Campbell is seen writing down something on some paper, not paying any attention to the debate. 10 seconds later, David Duke is seen waking him up. Foster is then seen looking around disoriented, clearly not paying any attention. The question had to be asked again.
There was also a Democrat woman candidate on stage which was virtually like a Hillary Clinton clone: 'vote for me because I'm a woman not for the snake next to me, David Duke.' Just like Hillary Clinton she works for Goldman Sachs and is funded by them with lots of cash.
Aside from everything else David Duke was a spectacular watch and if people can be opened minded about him he would win in a landslide actually because he was the strongest Trump supporter on the scene!
Trump needs a team of people who strongly support him, such as Jeff Sessions, strong loyalist people. He will need his team in order to drain the swamp and clean the system, otherwise he will just run into barriers and be unable to deliver any of his promises. Duke always came out in Trump's defense when other fled like flees. He even defended Trump with his pus*y tape. Not once has he refuted or denied Donald Trump. It appears that Duke would make a perfect Trump loyalist.
Donald Trump strongly disavowed David Duke but even being disavowed by the Republican leader, David pursued his own quest to win the senate and vehemently outlined his strong support for the nominee.
Trump has Jews in his family, his daughter Ivanka is Jewish, his son Erick is also Jewish by marriage and he has Jewish members in his staff allover such as Michael Cohen and he's a strong supporter of Israel and a good friend of Netanyahu. Now Trump doesn't have to agree with Duke's beliefs about Jews and frankly it doesn't matter. It's not like David would have any power to do anything as a Senator. In the senate, the power is collective, through voting thus he's powerless on his own with his own ideas. However if he's such a strong Trump supporter, then whenever Trump will ask for some law to be passed through Congress and Senate, Duke will deliver by voting in its favor. This is exactly the kind of people Trump needs in order to drain the swamp, obedient loyalists. Otherwise Trump will not be able to destroy the corrupt Washington octopus. Besides David stressed during the debate that he is not against all Jews, he's just against powerful billionaires who control the narrative such as the people working at CNN or major Hillary Clinton puppet master George Soros.
David Duke is definitely the best choice for Louisiana but if you still can't vote for him because of his past, then hopefully John Fleming would win since he was also a good supporter of Donald Trump. According to this article , 'toxic Trump' is only supported for real by David Duke and John Fleming:
Each is on record supporting Trump's candidacy. But except for Fleming, Maness and Duke (who seem eager to embrace Trump) , don't ask them why. Because Trump is so toxic , these 'leaders' must be grateful Louisiana is not a battleground state. They would surely hate to face a decision about whether to campaign with Trump if he showed up for rallies.
Rob Maness didn't participate in the debate because he is irrelevant, he's below 5 percent and would thus be a waste of votes. It's only between Fleming and Duke now. You wouldn't want to vote for another scumbag RINO who thinks Trump is 'toxic' and who would 'hate to campaign with Trump', now would you? Louisiana is a true red state, the choice is clear! Show the middle finger to establishment and vote for the candidate you thought supports Trump the most.

BLM (Black Lives Matter) thugs who are at least JUST AS BAD AS the KKK, or even worse for killing cops and holding violent rallies allover the country, held a violent protest outside the Dillard University where the debate took place, to oppose David Duke's right to run as a Senator. The thugs attacked cops and police cars resulting in at least 6 arrests . David Duke needed a police escort in order to exist the building safely.
So here's the debate:



ARTICLE


The liberal media is going bat$hit crazy over David Duke participating in Louisiana senate debate. BLM holds massive riot, attack police officers and damage their cars.
David Duke is a former Imperial grand dragon, wizard, sorcerer, magician cyclops of the knights of KKK and whatever you want to call him but what the bat$hit media is always conveniently forgetting to mention about him is that he is also a former Republican State Representative from 1989 to 1992 who reformed the party.
According to an online poll hosted by FOX 8 , the channel which hosted the debate, David Duke won the debate in a landslide. 92% of the respondents voted for David Duke but could this poll be accurate? Certainly NOT! David Duke has a lot of national support among his wizard circles while no one heard of the other 5 candidates outside of Louisiana. So his supporters rushed in to vote, but does he have any real authentic support in Louisiana? Yes, he has at least 5% state-wide support since he participated in the debate because you need at least 5 points in Louisiana state polls in order to qualify for the debates.

David Duke is associated with the devil across America so people naturally avoid admitting to support him in public polls so it is only logical to assume that his actual numbers may be more than double. This is a phenomenon now known as 'the shy voter'. Donald Trump suffers with the same phenomenon. When you see his polls out there. Those are only the known voters. There are many more voters who avoid publicly admitting that they support Donald Trump out of fear of repercussions from tolerant lefties.
If you have no idea who David Duke is, MSNBC of all TV stations out there did a quite fair description of him. He is a cutting edge politician whose ideas were stolen by establishment politicians, even top Democrats such as Bill Clinton, then claimed it were their ideas. Chris Hayes described David Duke as 'The Duke Effect', admitting that his ideas and policies were stolen by other politicians, such as: repealing affirmative action programs, stricter public housing guidelines, eliminating minority set-asides, welfare.
Philip Bump who was the guest at 'All In With Chris Hayes' said that Duke's fight from 1991 over welfare which evolved into a centrist position for Bill Clinton.
Chris Hayes said 'He's leading the edge over of the kind of political discourse that takes the country in a certain direction, not single-handedly.'

The former KKK wizard/magician/dragon/knight/snake/sorcerer, alright let's be fair to him'¶ the former Representative was definitely the most dominant figure in the debate and he stood his ground after Ted Cruz slandered him saying that he scammed his supporters.
John Neely Kennedy who is a former Democrat and who looks like and even sounds like he's Ted Cruz's lost twin brother, accused David Duke of being a convicted felon who went to prison for: 'lying to his supporters, he swindled them out of their money and took that money and used it for his gambling addiction'.
Duke wanted to respond and the moderator granted him 15 seconds which is definitely not enough for ANY of the candidates to rebuke an attack but, after just 12 seconds the moderator interrupted Duke and jumped in to help Ted Cruz! Sorry, John Neely Kennedy!
The moderator interrupted Duke and supported John Neely Cruz's accusations. After that, a full scandal broke out during the debate. The moderator saw that he was not going to back down so he finally decided to let him answer. Duke waved some papers in the air and said that he was audited and he actually overpaid his taxes by $6000 and that he was targeted because of his extreme political views.
We measured his second response time which he earned after being interrupted in the first place and it was a 40 seconds answer. Definitely over the allocated 15 seconds but the moderator preferred to create a scandal worth of 1 minute and 22 seconds instead of letting him answer the first time. Definitely some bias there, BUT after this incident/fight/scandal, the moderator was very fair and unbiased.
His supporters think that the moderator was also biased because of asking Duke about Trump's pus*y tape and why he condemn 'The CNN Jews'. Well the question was definitely legitimate since David Duke does spend a lot of time focusing on 'The Jews' which is the reason he never gained any serious traction. Not because that 'The Jews' don't have any power, on the contrary, they do own CNN actually, from top to bottom, but because the average American doesn't know and doesn't care about that. The average American cares about paying lower taxes, having a strong military and a strong border and David Duke should focus more on those things if he really cares about what white people want/need and if he wants to achieve more in his political career.
Aside for the 1 minute scandal there was also a funny moment during the debate, when they were talking about Social Security which is seen in the video below, at exactly minute 40 when Democrat candidate Foster Campbell is seen writing down something on some paper, not paying any attention to the debate. 10 seconds later, David Duke is seen waking him up. Foster is then seen looking around disoriented, clearly not paying any attention. The question had to be asked again.
There was also a Democrat woman candidate on stage which was virtually like a Hillary Clinton clone: 'vote for me because I'm a woman not for the snake next to me, David Duke.' Just like Hillary Clinton she works for Goldman Sachs and is funded by them with lots of cash.
Aside from everything else David Duke was a spectacular watch and if people can be opened minded about him he would win in a landslide actually because he was the strongest Trump supporter on the scene!

He's an Arab from Lebanon!!! And despite being married, he had been the client of 3 prostitutes who were later murdered . The choice is clear, its either David Duke or John Fleming!

Republican nominee Donald Trump won the US presidential vote among American citizens voting from Israel, according to an iVoteIsrael exit poll taken this week, but in an election plagued with low favorability ratings for both candidates, he had a far less impressive showing than past Republicans have in Israel.
As The Jerusalem Post exclusively reported on Wednesday, Trump received 49% of the Israeli-American vote, while Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton got 44%, according to the poll conducted by get-out-to vote organization iVoteIsrael and KEEVOON Global Research.
The majority of voters in Israel viewed the candidates unfavorably, with Trump receiving a 65% unfavorable rating and 32% favorable, and Clinton seen as 64% unfavorable and 34% favorable.
In fact, 49% of voters in Israel said the main reason they chose their candidate was because of the 'danger of electing the other candidate.' More Trump voters (60%) chose this reason than Clinton voters (39%).
Despite Trump winning among Americans in Israel, more of them are registered Democrats (33%) than Republicans (27%). Of Trump's votes in Israel, 25% came from Democrats, and 10% of Clinton's votes came from Republicans.
iVoteIsrael's poll found the states evenly split between the two major-party candidates, with New York, New Jersey, California, Maryland and swingstate Florida going to Trump, and Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois and swing-state Pennsylvania choosing Clinton. The votes from Ohio, another swing state, were tied at 44%.
Trump's margin of victory was larger among men only, 59% of whom voted for the Republican, while 52% of female voters chose Clinton.

A chilling Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( MoFA ) 'urgent action' report issued to all Federation ministries within the past hour is warning that the United States is now suffering a complete breakdown in its normal governmental functions after the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) notified President Obama that all of Hillary Clinton's believed to be deleted and/or destroyed secret emails have now been completely recovered . [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to a Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) addendum to this MoFA 'urgent action' report, the FBI was able to recover all of Hillary Clinton's once secret emails from the computer shared by her campaign vice chairman Huma Abedin and sexual deviant husband Anthony Weiner'î both of whom are now under the protection of the FBI as 'cooperating witnesses' against Hillary Clinton.
To exactly how all of Hillary Clinton's secret emails and documents ended up on the Abedin-Weiner laptop computer, the SVR explains, was due to its use of the Outlook and IMAP email protocols that will sync any folder, on any device, they are told to monitor and can be told to make local copies of emails 'îwhich simply means that Abedin used the laptop computer she shared with her disgraced husband to back up every communication Hillary Clinton ever made'îand that numbered 650,000 copies of emails, documents and other communications .
Unbeknownst, however, to both Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, and everyone else aiding their criminality, this report continues, is that when the US Congress ordered all of these secret emails turned over to them, Clinton, in turn, ordered them all destroyed 'îbut with her, and those aiding her, failing to realize that when these emails were 'bleached' (a computer program used to destroy hard drives) from her secret private server they did so with it offline, meaning that it wasn't able to 'backtrack' to the Abedin-Weiner laptop to destroy all of the backups emails, documents and communications discovered by the FBI .
Though the exact contents of these now discovered Hillary Clinton secret emails it is not fully 'known/understood' by the SVR, this report notes, the FBI agents who have been documenting their contents have become so horrified by what they're discovering they are now reporting to the American press that Hillary Clinton is the 'antichrist personified' .
Even worse, this report continues, with new Wikileaks showing that not only is Hillary Clinton and her criminal money laundering organization, known as the Clinton Foundation, being investigated by the FBI, nearly every other US intelligence and tax agency have, likewise, begun investigations too .
Thus leading, this report gravely explains, to a complete breakdown in the rule of law in the United States as the main investigators into Hillary Clinton's crimes are all now known to be her supporters who have received tens-of-millions of dollars in 'gifts/bribes' to protect her 'îand that led former CIA agent and American diplomat Dr. Steve Pieczenik to personally notify President Putin this past week that the US intelligence community has now launched a counter-coup against Hillary Clinton .

This report concludes by noting that not only did Dr. Pieczenik take the extraordinary 'measure/step' of informing President Putin of this US intelligence community counter-coup, he also posted his warning to YouTube for all of the American people to see too'îbut that in spite of its extraordinarily being viewed by over 2.5 million of these peoples in less than 24 hours , the Hillary Clinton supporting global tech giant Google has suppressed this fact from its main trends'î giving the top place, instead, to a video mocking Americans that has only 1.6 million views , and that stunningly doesn't include Dr. Pieczenik's warning video at all .

Hillary Clinton is up 6 points on Donald Trump in the latest Reuters-Ipsos poll .
She leads Donald Trump 45-39.
But, once again, the sampling data tells a different story.
Here are the numbers:
1228 'ì Dem 'ì45%
934 'ì Rep 'ì34%
329 'ì Ind 'ì12%

Independents make up 43% of the population in a 2015 Gallup poll.
And Republicans were (as usual) under-sampled in the poll.
So the pollsters oversampled Democrats by 11 points to give Hillary a 6 point lead.
They got the result they wanted 'ì a big Hillary lead.

With fake polls running rampant everywhere, with Reuters/Ipsos just releasing yet another fake poll oversampling Democrats by 11% and including only 'Likely Voters', then showing the results with Hillary Clinton leading by 6%, we have decided to conduct our own poll.
Our poll is a fair and unbiased poll. We have included Twitter hashtags for #DonaldTrump and #HillaryClinton as well as #GaryJohnson and #JillStein. It will reach both sides, thus being fully fair and balanced. Our poll also includes 3rd party candidates Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Voters can only vote once in our poll and their vote cannot be changed.
Thanks to Wikileaks email ID 26551 we now have confirmed data of what we all have long suspected, that polling agencies are being ordered to oversample as much as needed in order to artificially inflate the numbers of a specific candidates which has enough power to pull the strings or is simply preferred by the polling agency.
Most mainstream media polls only include 'Likely Voters' nowadays though it hasn't always been like this. According to their definition, Likely Voters means people who also voted in the previous elections. This is not an accurate way to measure the real preference out there because both Trump and Clinton benefit from what is known as first time voters. People who never voted before, people who feel disenfranchised by the system and who simply didn't want to vote before.
There is also the Millennial vote which is also impossible to include in the Likely Voters BS the media is pushing. Donald Trump is a revolutionary who vowed to change the system. This has brought millions of new people who never participated in the elections before. Bernie Sanders was also a revolutionary who vowed to do the exact same thing. Bernie lost or better said the election was stolen from him but that's another story. Bernie endorsed Hillary Clinton so, some of his voters have been transferred to Hillary Clinton now. Those first-time Bernie voters are also not included in the Likely Voters polls.
So without further due, we present to you our own OPEN POLL where everybody can vote only once. A fair an unbiased poll.
Who will you vote for in the upcoming US presidential election 2016? Note: There is a poll embedded within this post, please visit the site to participate in this post's poll. 

ARTICLE

It was supposed to be an edgy thriller that made statements about upper echelon decadence, while also utilizing the real world sex life of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a kind of doorway bridging the gap between reality and fantasy 'ì something that does come up in other Kubrick films, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey. In this Kubrick film, however, we have a statement about who runs the 'show.' The show is both the film itself, as well as reality, and Kubrick wants viewers to realize that reality is run by our present showmasters of the videodrome. The viewer is supposed to reflect upon the decadence of the Eastern elite establishment, but also notice that viewing the film itself is homage to present social hypocrisy, since the film is a wannabe voyeuristic step into the sex lives of others. In this regard, it functions as an initiation. None of the other analysts and commenters have really noticed this. Virtually every review I have read sees it as some elaborate 'MKULTRA/Illuminati' mind control thing (as is supposedly everything on those sites), while other reviews from professors and academia see it as a social or psychological commentary. 
I think it has elements of all this, but the real goal is, I believe, an initiation process. The viewer is watching the film because he or she is curious about Hollywood secrets and elite lives. Think of all the silly gossip magazines we have. The 'average Joe' went to see the film for a glimpse of Nicole Kidman, and Kubrick wants the viewer to see the hypocrisy in such an action, given that most people will 'judge' the film's secret society cult. Eyes Wide Shut, then, is a descriptor of the audience, as well as the characters in the film, who don't really understand the sociopolitical power base that runs things. The power base is not, according to Kubrick's film, the average politician or wealthy doctor or lawyer in New York. Indeed, this is precisely Kidman and Cruise's characters' status: they are unwitting inductees. Thus throughout the film, the viewers eyes are wide shut to the reality of the power structure, just as Kidman and Cruise's characters are, until the end, when they have their eyes 'opened,' as they both say at the end. Let us proceed. 
The opening scene shows us Mrs. Harford (Nicole Kidman) between two pillars. This is the doorway to the initiation, in other words. The two pillars figure prominently in Freemasonry as the entrance way to the divine, as borrowed from Solomon's temple: 
Nicole stands between two pillars 'ì Jachin and Boaz, setting the initiatory tone for the film. 
The two pillars of Freemasonry borrowed from Solomon's Temple, indicating the doorway to the 'mysteries' 
The viewer is being told from the beginning that they are to undergo an initiation into how the 'mysteries' and the secret societies work, particularly from a sociological perspective. The Harfords, we discover, are having marital troubles related to sexual frustrations. It is also significant that it is Christmas time, when the initiatory procedure takes place, as a kind of anti-traditional religious/anti-Christian statement. It is also important to remember that all details in a Kubrick film are significant 'ì the placement of everything is meaningful and deliberate. 
As mentioned in the picture above, the film is full of mirrors, which are symbols of the psyche, the inner world as it were, as well as other worlds. This occurs in Alice in Wonderland, for example, and this theme, as well as the Wizard of Oz, both figure prominently, and are theosophical allegories . Most commenters who note this point to it as some kind of MKULTRA control mechanism, but I think that is far-flung 'ì more realistic would be the usage of such stories as allegories or metaphors for transformation 'ì the metamorphosis of initiation into the 'mysteries,' if you will. Both stories have theosophic undertones and symbolism, and thus constitute initiatory tales as well. When the Harford's arrive at the party, we see a clear symbol of what kind of initiation they are going to undergo 'ì a Satanic one, as we see from the inverted pentagram: 
The doors of their perception are about to change as they enter the party marked with an inverted pentagram. 
Ziegler, Harford's friend, invites the couple to his parties frequently under the auspices of eventually getting them to participate in the orgies. As it turns out, there are two parties, and Mr. Harford's old college buddy, Nick Nightingale, plays piano for both. Initially, both Harfords resist the temptation to sleep with other people, yet appear to have the desire given their own marital sexual problems. However, what we continue to suspect is not that the events are randomly occurring, but rather that it has been organized. It is not an accident that Bill Harford's college buddy has shown up. Alice gets drunk and is then hit on by Sandor Szavost, a wealthy Hungarian. Szavost is likely a reference to Anton Szandor LaVey , the founder and High Priest of the Church of Satan. I think this is a symbolic reference, just to let us know the crowd they are being allowed to party with is ultimately an upper echelon Satanic cult. It is also interesting to note that the original story ('Dream Story') is written about a couple who undergoes the experience in upper class Austria around the turn of the century, since Germany is the origin of the actual members of the Order of Illuminati . 
Bill discovers that Ziegler is involved in some shady dealings, and apparently has some connection to drugs and beauty queens. 'Mandy,' a beauty queen we later discover, is knocked out from drugs 'ì 'asleep' and nude, and we will find Alice experience something similar. Mandy has almost overdosed, and Dr. Harford tells her she cannot keep doing what she is doing: we don't know if it's a suicide attempt or not. It is also interesting that the nude woman in the painting above Mandy is sprawled out in the same position, as if to allude to the film's thesis of a thin borderline between fantasy or dream, and reality. 
Next, we see the Harfords going about daily activities. Notice again the inverted pentagrams in the background: 
More inverted pentagrams pop up. 
The Harfords then have a big argument over sex and the desire to cheat, and Alice tells Bill she once wanted to have sex with a young man years ago at a hotel. Throughout their condo we see images of gateways in gardens, indicating again that this is a film about initiation. Gardens also bring to mind Eden, and the expulsion of Adam and Eve due to sin, or it could refer to their coming initiation into the 'garden of the gods,' so to speak, as they are about to experience the underworld in overworld. 
Bill then leaves to visit a patient who has passed away, and begins his languorous escapade for an extra-marital affair. He finds out his patient's daughter has a crush on him, but Bill decides to remain faithful and leaves. He begins to suspect marriage is bad for others, too, as Sandor had tried to convince Alice. Bill then roams the streets looking for sexual fulfillment, passing hookers and sex shops. He then gets harassed by a group of guys who (for no reason whatsoever) call him a homosexual, showing society's obsession with sex. Bill bumps into a pretty hooker and is invited to her apartment. He concedes, and steps into the world of the lower class, finding that sex is an 'issue' everywhere. More symbolic imagery is used, as we see the prominent placement of books on sociology in the whore's apartment. Kubrick is showing us that he is making a statement on sociology 'ì but not the one most people think. It's the true sociology of how the world is really run. Bill is interrupted from his cheating and decides not to. There are also numerous masks inside the hookers apartment, showing you that society wears a mask, has a fake facade of Christianity 'ì since there are Christmas trees everywhere 'ì yet is anything but traditionally religious. Instead, the masks show society as a fraud. But beyond that, Kubrick wants the viewer to see that those who really run things are masked 'ì they constitute a secret team of wealthy, upper class who remain in the shadows. In fact, this is in my estimation, to be another clue that the hooker is also not a real hooker 'ì she is part of the secret society (hence the masks in her apartment), and is being used to reel Bill in, just like Nick Nightingale. Most hookers don't study sociology. 
The whore is a hired member of the secret society and her apartment has masks as a clue. 
Bill leaves and runs across his buddy Nick playing at another club in town. Nick tells him about the after party 'ì the second party that Sandor had mentioned to Alice it turns out, where Nick plays piano blindfolded. Bill is intrigued, and decides to try to sneak in, after tracking down a cheesy mask and costume at the only costume store still open. The password, Nick tells Bill, is 'Fidelio,' bringing to mind the theme of marital faithfulness that has been constantly in question in the film so far. Bill finds the costume shop, named The Rainbow, which is what the two women who propositioned him at the party had already mentioned 'ì that he can find what he is after 'at the end of the rainbow.' This is a Wizard of Oz reference, and the mirrors and 'Alice' have already suggested Alice in Wonderland. Bill is still oblivious, however, to the synchronicity which, in my opinion, has been planned. The events are Bill's initiation, and he is being tested to see if he will be faithful either to his wife, his ambiguous sense of moral, or, ultimately, to the cult 'ì hence, 'fidelio.' It should be noted as well that the cult is clearly Satanic, and Lucifer, the fallen angel of Scripture, who sought to dethrone God, is the light-bearer. And of course light is a prism or rainbow. 
Bill finds what he has been led to 'ì the end of the rainbow. 
The costume shop is run by a foreigner who pimps out his daughter, we discover, and I suspect this reference to underage sex also implies connection to the Satanic cult, since my analysis is that events are all planned. Tom then takes a cab to the mansion and sneaks in using the password. There we see a kind of initiation ritual where numerous models are inducted into the cult in a kind of mock Catholic mass, with Bill noticing everyone wearing masks. 
Masked balls go back to ancient times, but the past few hundred years they have come to mark the party life of certain cadres of the upper echelons of power. Renaissance Britain had many masked balls, as well as France, and according to Vatican insider and exorcist, Malachi Martin in his famous book Hostage to the Devil, such ritual orgies certainly do take place. Bill is tricked into revealing his identity and we get the impression the cult is going to kill him, until a girl steps forward to 'ransom' herself for him. I suspect this is Mandy from earlier in the film, who now wants out of the secret society. Her way out will be death, as Bill will discover her name in the obituary for an overdose. Here is a great example of a modern masked ball of upper class elites . 
Bill takes the cab home and Alice wakes up giggling and laughing, as if she had been drugged. He tells her she was dreaming, and she starts to cry. He asks what the 'dream' was and she says it was 'so weird' 'ì 'we were in a deserted city and our clothes were gone. We were naked and I was terrified and I felt ashamed. And I was angry because you'¶rushed away to find clothes for us. As soon as you were gone it was completely different. I felt wonderful. Then I was lying in a beautiful garden stretched out naked in the sunlight and a man walked out of the woods. He was the man from the hotel I told you about 'ì the Naval officer. He stared at me and he just laughed. He just laughed at me'¶.He was kissing me and then we were making love, then there were all these other people around us 'ì hundreds of them everywhere 'ì they were all fucking. And then I was fucking other men, so many I don't know how many I was with. I knew I could see me in the arms of all these men'¶and I wanted to make fun of you, to laugh in your face. And so I laughed as loud as could. And that must have been when you woke me up.' 
This, in my opinion, is a key clue to the fact that they are both being inducted into the cult. Either Alice has been drugged and doesn't recall being used, thinking it was a dream, or she is a willing part of the initiation process for Bill, insofar as she has already been brought in. Either are possible. Bill is distraught and tries to track down the cult again, but is warned not to inquire any further. Bill decides he still wants to have an affair, and calls up the whore, only to discover she is nowhere to be found and that she has aids. Bill leaves and wanders the streets again, only to find that he is being followed by shady characters. He finds out in the paper that Mandy has overdosed, and he goes to the morgue to find out that she had most likely been killed. Bill goes to talk to Ziegler and Ziegler reveals that he is in the cult and was there that night when Bill snuck in. Ziegler warns him to not investigate any further, while Bill is shocked that his good friend is part of a secret society magic sex cult. It is also interesting that Ziegler's house is decorated with paintings of what appear to be British aristocracy. 
Ziegler tells him that he figured out that Nick had mentioned the cult. Ziegler tells Bill he had him followed and found out he had been seeking out why Nick had disappeared. Ziegler then says, 'Bill, suppose I tell that everything that happened there, the threats, the girl's warnings, suppose I said all of that was staged. That it was a kind of charade. That it was fake?'¶to scare the shit out of you to keep you quiet about where you'd been and what you'd seen.' Bill tells Ziegler he saw Mandy's body, and Ziegler says she was the one at the party. Bill asks what kind of charade ends with someone ending up dead. In other words, we find out that it was a ritual killing. Bill comes home to find the mask that he had lost on the pillow next to Alice, who is asleep. In other words, we are to suspect either that Alice knows he was there, or she is telling him that she is involved. Bill breaks down and 'tells her everything.' Bill has been initiated into top dog Satanic masonry 'ì not just the local low-level stuff. Significantly, Cruise's character gives the Masonic sign of Secrecy 'ì the hand on the chest with forefinger extended up, as mentioned in of Richardson's Monitor of Freemasonry , page 86. 
Oath of Secrecy 
Here is Satanist Aleister Crowley giving the sign of secrecy. 
Bill confesses to Alice and they both are upset. After the confession the realize they had promised to take their daughter Christmas shopping that morning. In the shopping scene we see another inverted pentagram and a purposefully placed 'Magic circle' game, as well as another display labelled 'magic.' The couple has now stepped into the magic circle and their eyes are no longer shut. They have been 'illuminated.' We had already seen a 'magic circle' of models at the initiation ritual in the mansion. In the toy store, Bill and Alice discuss what they should do, deciding that they should be 'grateful.' Alice says 'we should be grateful that we have managed to survive through all our adventures, whether they were real or only a dream.' Bill asks if she is sure, and Alice says she will forgive one night and Bill says 'No dream is ever just a dream.' Alice responds that they are 'awake now, and hopefully, for a long time to come' 'Forever,' they both say. 'Let's not say forever,' Alice retorts, 'it frightens me. But I do love you, and you know, there is something very important we need to do as soon as possible 'ì fuck.' 
Alice and Bill are surrounded by pentagrams and the 'Magic Circle.' 
So the film is certainly about the different issues of marital problems our society creates, with its decadence and veneer of Christianity, as well as its sexual issues, but that is only half the story. The story is about the couple 'waking up' and seeing the social power structure as it really is 'ì rich elites who are into bizarre cults and weird sex magic. If you want your eyes opened, this is the whole point of the film. The power structure is about power and sex, but not just any old thing 'ì particularly ritualized sex and gnostic, masonic, Satanic cult versions. This was the point of the Eden imagery, as well as the Alice and Wonderland and Oz references 'ì the transition both from a fantasy reality of the dreamworld and base sexual desires, into the fake world of the film itself, as well as the transition from eyes shut, to awake. Not only was it supposed to be an initiation for the couple, the viewer is supposed to be initiated to the nature of the underworld, as well. This is what all the other reviewers have missed. 
On March 7, 1999, only 4 days after screening a final cut of Eyes Wide Shut for his family and the stars, Stanley Kubrick was killed by the Satanic secret societies and it was claimed that he died in his sleep of 'natural causes'.

Hillary Clinton's ties to satanic rituals and the occult have been well-documented for decades.
Clinton insider Larry Nichols told Infowars that Hillary Clinton used to attend a ' witch's church ' in Los Angeles during Bill's presidency.
The currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is : 'the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel,' and that 'the reason why they're leaking is they're pro-Trump.'
Also, DC insider Doug Hagmann broke the news that the NYPD found a blackmail sex network on Anthony Weiner's computer.
Furthermore, the latest bombshell to come from WikiLeaks connects Clinton campaign head John Podesta to top occultist Marina Abramovic .
Marina Abramovic is a Crypto . She does not publicly admit her putrid roots but her name gives her up. Oligarch Roman Abramovich who managed to escape justice in Russia and fled to the UK is also Jewish but he is public about it.
Abramovic is a common name among Jewish people living in Slavic countries, because they like to brag that they are the descendants of Abraham. Abramovic is a derivation of Abraham. In the Holy Bible, John 8:39-44 there is actually a very revealing conversation about this specific issue:
' Abraham is our father ,' they (Jews) answered. ' If you were Abraham's children ,' said Jesus, ' then you would do what Abraham did. 
As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.
You are doing the works of your own father.' 'We are not illegitimate children,' they protested. 'The only Father we have is God himself.'
Jesus said to them, 'If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me.
Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.
You belong to your father, the devil , and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
This email comes shortly after we previously had another email where Jennifer Palmieri, Campaign Chairman John Podesta and John Halpin discuss about how much they HATE Christians, especially Catholics and Evangelicals .
Infowars reporter Paul Joseph Watson breaks down the 'spirit cooking' ritual:

The Clinton Satanic network has now been exposed on a national level thanks to WikiLeaks.

Abramovic in particular invited Podesta to a 'spirit cooking' dinner, an occult ritual started by infamous Satanist Aleister Crowley, which involves eating semen, blood and breast milk.

Here are some examples of what a 'spirit cooking' dinner with Marina Abramovic looks like:

'î Viva Europa (@realVivaEuropa) November 4, 2016 

Another email from WikiLeaks even shows Abramovic being invited to Hillary Clinton's campaign launch party.
The Drudge Report linked this article at the top of the site propelling the hashtag #SpiritCooking to the top of Twitter's trending hashtag section.
The internet exploded this morning after the news broke.
When you click on the top trending hashtag #SpiritCooking on Twitter, Hillary Clinton's page comes up.
Here's Abramovic pictured hanging out with top musicians Jay-Z and Lady Gaga.

During the RNC in Cleveland, Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson called out Clinton on her Luciferian ties.

Similarly, an article from CNN in 1996 discusses Hillary's affiliation with dark magic.
More information on that article can be found here .
Bill Clinton's book My Life: The Early Years describes their trips to Haiti where they participated in 'voodoo rituals.'
So far, all these revelations has hurt the Clinton campaign and Hillary is already losing voters.

Hillary Clinton refused to send help as the terrifying Benghazi attacks unfolded, according to messages allegedly hacked from her email server and distributed by Russian operatives.
RadarOnline has obtained a report about the allegedly hacked messages that was created by Italy's foreign intelligence agency, or the Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Esterna, after a meeting with their Russian counterparts on October 22. (These files were written in Italian, and then translated by a respected New York City professor of the language.)
One section of the report deals with September 2012 'î the same month as the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, and three others. In an alleged message from Clinton to top aide Huma Abedin, the secretary made it clear she wasn't going to rush to take action.
'Avoid that they appeal to the AUMF, lets give a political weight to the wait, take time,' the message reads. (The acronym AUMF most likely refers to an 'authorization for the use of military force.')
The text continues, 'What has happened has happened, at Sigonella they are standing still, they have to remain firm.'
Sigonella almost certainly refers to Naval Air Station Sigonella, located in the Italian island region of Sicily. According to reports, a US Air Force source once claimed that attack jets were being armed and fueled at Aviano Air Force Base in northern Italy on Sept. 11, 2012, or the night of the Benghazi attacks. The source has said the jets could have refueled at Sigonella, which is located some 400 miles from Benghazi, and helped stave off the slaughter.

What appears to be test pages for graphics clientele for news stations across the country could in fact turn out to be another Dewey wins moment or more recently, akin to the BBC reporting the collapse of building 7 on 911√¢‚Ç¨≈ö before it happened.
Election night results are big business. WorldNow.com, a 17 year old CMS and digital tech provider was recently publicly traded to San Francisco based messaging company Frankly for $45 million. SO it comes as no surprise that yet another facet of the election process is out of the oversight of citizens and in the greedy hands of the corporatocracy.
NBC affiliate WRCB TV in Chattanooga, Tennessee has inadvertently posted election night results. The results page appears to be similar to what mainstream news networks display on election night, including Presidential and Congressional results, the popular vote count, electoral votes, and percentage of precincts reporting.
As Jim Stone notes, the page was pulled directly from the WorldNow.com content management platform utilized by major networks like NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox and appears to be a non-public staging area for news and election results. The original page has since been reset.

Project Veritas Action has just released a new video relating to the investigations of Hillary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s private email servers.
In December, 2010, US Department of State IT Systems Administrator Cindy Almodovar reported that she met with Huma Abedin for thirty minutes regarding emails at the then unknown, but now notorious, @clintoneail.com site. Here√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s is the text from that email exchange:
From: Almodovar, Cindy T
Sent: Friday, December 17, 2010 11:17 AM
To: SES-IRM_Tech
Cc: SES-IRM_FO-Mgt
Subject: Meeting with Huma
I met with Huma for about 30 minutes to go over mail issues.
She gave me some examples listed below, but also, things are inconsistent. But issue #1 is of an e-mail which was sent to her twice this morning, did get received on but was not delivered. See details below.
I have a contact for the @clintonemail site, his name is Bryan Pagliano and he actually now works for State, but he apparently set all of this up.
Huma sent several tests from her clintonemail account to Lona and myself √¢‚Ç¨' they were received. But there are many messages and responses not received.
o She sent a message this morning from her state.gov account to cheftwan@mail.house.gov.
√Ç¬ß Recipient responded, but she didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get the response. I found that the response arrived and is on as √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsubmitted to Categorizer√¢‚Ç¨¬ù at 6:47 this morning.
√Ç¬ß It was resent at 7:11 am by sender to huma, received and also √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsubmitted to Categorizer√¢‚Ç¨¬ù on
o On 12/14, hdr22@clintonemail.com sent a message to huma@clintonemail.com and Valmoroli@state.gov at 10:03 pm. The subject line was blank. Huma received at Clinton address, but Lona did not receive on her state.gov account.

As a result of subsequent investigations regarding Secretary Hillary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s use of a private email server, the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. State Department reported the following:
From the unclassified May 2016 State Department report ESP-16-03:
Two staff in S/ES-IRM reported to OIG that, in late 2010, they each discussed their concerns about Secretary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s use of a personal email account in separate meetings with the then-Director of S/ES-IRM. In one meeting, one staff member raised concerns that information sent and received on Secretary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s account could contain Federal records that needed to be preserved in order to satisfy Federal recordkeeping requirements. According to the staff member, the Director stated that the Secretary√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s personal system had been reviewed and approved by Department legal staff and that the matter was not to be discussed any further. As previously noted, OIG found no evidence that staff in the Office of the Legal Adviser reviewed or approved Secretary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s personal system. According to the other S/ES-IRM staff member who raised concerns about the server, the Director stated that the mission of S/ES-IRM is to support the Secretary and instructed the staff never to speak of the Secretary√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s personal email system again.
The director referred to in OIG report is John Bentel. In 2010, he was the State Department employee who managed IT security issues for the top echelon of the department. He told FBI investigators those conversations back in 2010 never occurred. In March of 2016, Bentel refused to answer questions from Senate investigators and asserted his Fifth Amendment right 87 times during a deposition for a civil lawsuit related to Hillary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s use of a private email server.
While it seems clear Ms. Almodovar knew about the @clintonemail.com server in 2010, there is no indication that the FBI, Washington Post or New York Times have interviewed her. The Washington Post clearly knew of the aforementioned section in the OIG report, but neglected to follow through on questioning.
Since there was no indication that either the mainstream media or the Justice Department was questioning Almodovar, Project Veritas Action sent a journalist as her about the truth of the issue. Here√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a partial transcript from that interview:
PV Journalist: I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m working on a story. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m interested. I want to know the truth and I want to know if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re one of the people who came, who went to John Bentel and said they were concerned about Hillary√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s private server.
Almodovar: I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know anything about that.
PV Journalist: You weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t involved in that at all?
Almodovar: You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got to stop this because this is like harassment.
PV Journalist: This will be the last time you see me. I just want to know the truth. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m interested. I want to know if the FBI has talked to you.
Almodovar: No they haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t.
PV Journalist: They haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t at all√¢‚Ç¨≈ö
√¢‚Ç¨≈öPV Journalist: I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure reporters and people have been coming to your door.
Almodovar: No. No one has come to the door. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re the first one.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìEven though her name stands out in the emails released by the FBI, no one from the FBI ever spoke to Aldomovar,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù said Project Veritas Action founder James O√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢Keefe. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo one interviewed her or made any attempt to get to the bottom of what information she might have about this case that is so important to national security. It made us wonder'¶ who else the FBI neglected to talk with.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù

According to a new Wikileaks email, Bernie Sanders was just a Manchurian candidate and a Clinton puppet all along. We finally have confirmation of what we have suspected since Bernie said 'people are sick of hearing about your damn emails' all the way back in 2015 during one debate. That was a big give-away and a huge red flag which many have raised back then but now we finally have irrefutable proof that Bernie Sanders was just a SCAM candidate and a con artist.
Bernie's ONLY role was gather millennials plus the angry people on the left, the Democrats who feel disappointed with the Obama establishment which could later be passed over to Hillary Clinton. These people would have never came directly to Hillary Clinton in the first place so they needed an intermediary, like a vessel. Some eventually came to Hillary but not too many since it was discovered that the nomination was stolen from Bernie and he didn't protest at all.
Now yet ANOTHER email by Robby Mook who is Hillary's campaign strategist and manager has come out thanks to Wikileaks where it appears that Hillary Clinton had 'leverage' to use against Bernie Sanders in case he ever stepped over the line and that they had to 'signal' him after he violated their 'agreement'.
Wikileaks Emails ID 47397 reveals the following disturbing information: 
This isn't in keeping w the agreement . Since we clearly have some leverage , would be good to flag this for him. I could send a signal via Welch'ìor did you establish a direct line w him
We now have written confirmation that there was an agreement between Hillary Clinton and false revolutionary Bernie Sanders from the beginning. So now we know why Bernie isn't appalled by Hillary calling his supporters basement dwellers , bucket of losers and dumb millennials . Now we know why he continues to campaign with her despite being investigated by the FBI for child pornography, Satanic rituals and was even caught causing riots in places like Chicago with paid protesters dressed as Bernie Sanders supporters so they can get the blame.
If you are a former Bernie Sanders supporter who feels disappointed after this one, here's the reason why you should vote for Donald Trump and why we believe Trump is the real socialist you were all looking for.
So despite everything, he's still with her. Now we know why! I mean we always felt like we knew why but we didn't have any proof. Now we have the proof to back up our claims.

Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s New York office features an oil painting in which two men are preparing to eat another human.
The image, which was shown during a 2015 exposƒÇ¬® on the Clinton campaign headquarters by Politico, was lent to Podesta by his lobbyist brother Tony.
The painting was specifically mentioned 9 months later in an article on Podesta by Time Magazine .
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOn the wall in his office at Hillary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Brooklyn headquarters, campaign chairman John Podesta has an oil painting on loan from his lobbyist brother, who is an avid art collector,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù the Time article states. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe image shows two men hunched over a dining room table, bearing knives and forks. On the table lays a man in a suit, who looks vaguely like Podesta.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù



Podesta explained during the interview that he regularly tells colleagues that he would prefer to be the man with the fork.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s better to be the guy with the fork than the guy on the table,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù he said.
The image resurfaced on social media Friday after emails published by WikiLeaks revealed both John and his brother Tony√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s connection to Marina Abramovi√Ñ'°, a performance artist known for gory and occultist performances.
Podesta√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s painting is incredibly similar to one of Abramovi√Ñ'°√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s art displays in which she and pop star Lady Gaga eat off of a mock bloodied body.
The WikiLeaks emails specifically surrounded Abramovi√Ñ'° inviting both the Podesta brothers to attend an event known as √¢‚Ç¨≈ìSpirit Cooking.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSpirit Cooking is an event and central ritual started by Marina Abramovi√Ñ'°, who is an artist known for her gory performances and occultist rituals,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù the website Everipedia notes.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe origins of Spirit Cooking can be found in the preludes to production of the Cake of Light material, a sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
The Podestas' "Spirit Cooking" dinner?
It's not what you think.
It's blood, sperm and breastmilk.
But mostly blood. https://t.co/gGPWFS3B2H pic.twitter.com/I43KiiraDh 
'î WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 4, 2016 

Video of Abramovi√Ñ'° engaging in the ritual, which involves menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm, can be found online.
The hashtag #SpiritCooking trended for hours on Twitter Friday following the email chain√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s discovery. Clinton-supporters in the media attempted to outright deny or downplay Podesta√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s extracurricular activities, claiming such behavior is mundane.
The fact that those close to Clinton are engaged in such disturbing rituals should cause concern to any American who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t view carving Pentagram√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s into their flesh as √¢‚Ç¨≈ìnormal.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù

WikiLeaks has released another batch of emails from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta.
The whistleblowing site has published more than 50,000 emails in the lead up to the presidential election on Tuesday. Today√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s trache contains 2074 new emails.
Saturday√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s release contained transcripts from Bill Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fundraising speeches, which included the former president attacking UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and discussing the need for a tough leader to √¢‚Ç¨≈ìenforce the trigger that will re-impose sanctions√¢‚Ç¨¬ù should Iran violate the nuclear deal.
Also included are examples of Clinton aides worrying √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthere are no good answers√¢‚Ç¨¬ù to questions about the Clinton Foundation.
Chelsea Clinton using Foundation money for wedding 
A January 2012 email chain from longtime Clinton adviser and former Clinton Foundation fundraiser Doug Band accuses Chelsea Clinton of using Foundation money for her wedding.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe investigation into her getting paid for campaigning, using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents'¶.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Band says to Podesta.
Band dislikes Chelsea Clinton particularly as she was investigating his role in the Foundation and appears often in the Podesta emails.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI hope that you will speak to her and end this once we go down this road√¢‚Ç¨≈ö√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Band says.
Podesta complains about √¢‚Ç¨Àúf*cking psychotic√¢‚Ç¨¬ù media 
In an email from July 2015, Neera Tanden, Clinton aide and president of the Center for American Progress, goes on a tirade about the press being √¢‚Ç¨≈ìpsychotic√¢‚Ç¨¬ù in reference to a Politico article by Dylan Byers, which highlighted Podesta√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s concern over the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìpsychosis of the media.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey are f*cking psychotic,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Podesta sums up, in regards to the press, at the end of the chain with Tanden.
Billionaire Saban directs campaign strategy 
An email thread from July 2015 reveals the level of influence billionaire Haim Saban, one of the Clintons√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ biggest donors, has on Hillary√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s presidential campaign.
Unlike many donors, who have to go through intermediaries to get high up campaign access, Saban√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s case appears to be different. In the email to Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook, Saban requests a discussion, writing, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìCan one of you please call me at your earliest convenience? Tx.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
After Podesta and Mook get in touch with Saban, Podesta writes, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHaim thinks we are under reacting to Trump/Hispanics. Thinks we can get something by standing up for Latinos or attacking R's for not condemning.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Director of Communications weighs in, √¢‚Ç¨¬ùHaim is right 'ì we should be jamming this all the time.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìA and X 'ì can we think about what else we should do?' she asks Clinton staffers Amanda Renteria and Xochitl Hinojosa. 'Issue a broader challenge? Do something tied to Fourth of July were we declared all equal? Get CHC to do a letter?√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Brent Budowsky happy Supreme Court deadlock 
An email from February 2012, written by Brent Budowsky, columnist for The Hill, shows how the Clinton ally is advising Podesta on how to make the most of the Supreme Court deadlock.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI have been looking for this opportunity, which is not as easy as it sounds, but this would be a gift to de-brand the entire Republican party as a whole and mobilize the grassroots Democrats en masse for a sustained period,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Budowsky writes.
He adds, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIf Republicans want to make the Supreme Court dysfunctional for a year, we can turn every Republican Senator into Ted Cruz and win a big Senate campaign victory in November. Everything the public hates about Washington is embodied by Republicans here.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Getting high-ranking Muslims on board for Clinton campaign 
Kamran Bajwa, partner for major law firm Kirkland, sends an email to Podesta in July 2016 highlighting how he has been √¢‚Ç¨≈ìreaching out√¢‚Ç¨¬ù to American-Muslims who √¢‚Ç¨≈ìidentify as Americans first and as Muslims√¢‚Ç¨¬ù to help with fundraising and volunteering for Clinton.
Bajwa asks Podesta to √¢‚Ç¨≈ìplease keep this confidential√¢‚Ç¨¬ù in relation to the high-ranking Muslims he recommends including Anas Osman, Senior VP at Google Corp, Ahmad Nassar, President of NFL Players, Inc., and Faisal Ashraf, a healthcare entrepreneur.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI think a good next step would be to have the key committee people I have mentioned meet with you and the leadership team as soon as possible,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Bajwa writes.
Anti-politicians 
In August 2015, Tanden emails Podesta to discuss Bernie Sanders. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIs it the assumption of the campaign not to worry about Sanders? I'm having a hard time understanding that so I thought I'd check in,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù she says.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOur trust in government research shows how much people are feeling let down by politicians, which is fueling a real antipathy to the political class. In that world, I can understand the rise of Sanders and Trump -anti-politicians to say the least.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù she says.

An absolutely stunning Ministry of Finance ( MoF ) report circulating in the Kremlin today is expressing 'outrage/anger' against the US Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) for its leaking to the New York Post some of the details relating to the disappearance of $20 million from a private Hillary Clinton charity that Federation banking regulators have determined was a bribe used by her to pay President Obama so that she could become the American Secretary of State. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, the practice of President Obama selling American government positions was first raised in 2013 by US diplomats who publically cried foul over this massive bribery scheme 'îand that hacked emails and documents proved was widespread, including bribes to become everything form ambassadors to assistant attorneys in the Justice Department .
To the largest known bribe to President Obama for a US government position though, this report continues, MoF banking regulators discovered in a Citibank Kazakhstan numbered (secret) account originally holding $20 million linked to the American leader by transfers made from it to his 'personal/private' JPMorgan Chase account .
To how this discovery was made, this report notes, was through a MoF banking examination of the Republic of Kazakhstan who is seeking to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ( AIIB ) that the Federation is the third largest shareholder in after China and India .
During the MoF's examination of the Kazakhstan banking system on behalf of the AIIB, this report explains, a 'mysterious/suspicious' numbered (secret) account (that originally held $20 million) was discovered at Citibank Kazakhstan in the name of a private American entity (not a non-profit) called the Haiti Development Fund LLC that was created by the Clinton Foundation criminal money laundering organization and was solely funded by Canadian mining mogul Frank Giustra and Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim with the money being 'channeled/funneled' through the Clinton-Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada).
Frank Giustra, this report explains, is one of Hillary Clinton's main supporters who, so far, has given her over $100 million as well allowing her to use of one of his private luxury jets , while Carlos Slim has, likewise, pledged to give her $100 million 'îand who just months prior to Clinton announcing her run for the US presidency, in 2015, became the majority owner of the New York Times that throughout this American election cycle has turned this once internationally respected newspaper into nothing more than a Donald Trump 'destruction machine' with it even shockingly admitting ' that because Trump says things that are rude, politically incorrect, or debatable, and 'conducting his campaign in ways we've not normally seen,' there is no need for news reporters to treat him to objective reporting '.
With the Carlos Slim's New York Times being the beginning of the ' vast leftist echo chamber ' created to defeat Donald Trump, this report says, its nearly all untrue articles about him are able to be parroted by hundreds of other news sites while at the same time ignoring the vast criminality of Hillary Clinton'îand that due to Wikileaks the Clinton campaign has been forced to admit, including Hillary Clinton illegally accepting millions in bribes from radical Islamic countries , and a staggering internal Clinton Foundation document admitting that it is not a charity, but a 'political operation' that has broken the law .
Equally as stunning to the self admitting facts that the Clinton Foundation is corrupt, this report continues, has been Carlos Slim's New York Times keeping from the American people the shocking truth relating to Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta's pedophilia'îand as evidenced by his home being filled with paintings, photos and sculptures of naked teenager children, and that the Washington Post attempted to cover up , but whose original story about this abhorrent crime against children can still be viewed online .
And as if Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta's pedophilia isn't enough to shock normal human senses, this report says, Carlos Slim's New York Times covering up his fascination with human cannibalism is equally as concerning as new Wikileaks documents have revealed his satanic occult relationship with it is called 'Spirit Cooking' whose sickening rituals include the use of blood, semen and breast milk .
Though the MoF does note that the current war being waged by the FBI against Hillary Clinton ( and as we've previously reported on ) is, indeed, justified , this report concludes, their leaking to the New York Post elements of a Federation investigation isn't'îand that led Prime Minister Medvedev earlier today to state that relations between Russia and the United States ' have now hit rock bottom '.

A NEW SHOCKING VIDEO is now leaving everyone stunned. Watch and see for yourself! Barack Obama is now openly calling on illegal aliens to vote in Tuesday's election so they can help Hillary Clinton.
No one in the media is making a big scandal of out this! Let's say the vast majority of those illegal immigrants would vote for Trump, would the media create a big scandal out of it then? Of course they would! What's even more shocking is that this interview was conducted on November 4th, 2 days ago so we only learned about it now. The media is trying to hide this damning interview where Obama is openly calling on people to break the law!
Obama said when you vote you become a citizen! What the hell is wrong this guy?
Reporter: Many dreamers and undocumented are scared to vote, can they vote?
Obama: When you vote you become a citizen and no one will investigate you!
Imagine yourself going to Japan or South Africa to vote in their elections, what the hell is this a banana republic?
It is over folks this just shows how desperate the establishment is. Its either Trump or revolution. The American people can not accept the results of a stolen election where millions of illegals were allowed to vote.
This whole lawless administration is lies at every turn, Obamacare, Benghazi, Hillary's private server and emails and now they are calling on illegal aliens to vote. This is the last chance the American people have to save their country and frankly the entire world. If Hillary wins now, Republicans would never stand a chance because she will bring tens of millions of more illegals who would always vote for Democrats.
Obama even has a website for illegals where he is teaching them how to vote: iwillvote.com
Gina Rodriguez asked Obama: 
'Many of the millennials, dreamers, undocumented, uhhh 'citizens' and I call them 'citizens' cause they contribute to this country are fearful of voting, so if I vote, will immigration know where I live, will they come for my family and deport us?'
Barack Obama then answered: 
'Not true! And the reason is, first of all when you vote, you are a citizen yourself and there is not a situation where the voting rolls are somehow transferred over and people start investigating, etc. The sanctity of the vote is strictly confidential in terms of who you voted for. If you have a family member who maybe is undocumented, then you have an even greater reason to vote.'
Neil Cavuto of Fox Business was first to bring this video to the public on a major TV station, so we are eternally grateful about it because without him we wouldn't have known that the Obama regime is planning to allow and not go after illegals voting in these elections!
There is no way in hell they can freaking spin this one out

CNN asked the Democratic National Committee to prepare questions for Wolf Blitzer's interview with Donald Trump, according to emails released by Wikileaks.
In an April 25 email entitled 'Trump Questions for CNN,' the DNC's Lauren Dillon asked fellow Democrats for questions Blitzer could ask Trump.
'Wolf Blitzer is interviewing Trump on Tues ahead of his foreign policy address on Wed,' she wrote. 'Please send me thoughts by 10:30 AM tomorrow. Thanks!'
The DNC came up with a lengthy set of questions for CNN :
'ì Who helped you write the foreign policy speech you're giving tomorrow? Which advisors specifically did you talk to? What advice did they give you? Did they give you any advice that you chose not to take?
'ì CIA Director Brennan and former CIA Director Hayden have both said that our military and intelligence officers might refuse to follow some of your orders if you were president. What would you do if the military refused to listen to you? Should they be court-martialed if they refuse to follow orders?
'ì You've said you look to Ambassador John Bolton for military advice and called him 'terrific,' but he was one of the architects of the Iraq war. How do you explain your praise for Bolton if you also claim the war was a mistake? What advice have you taken from him?
You can read the rest here , but there's a few other gems:
'ì Do you think American victims of 9/11 should be able to sue Saudi Arabia in court? What role, if any, do you think Saudi Arabia had in the 9/11 attacks?
'ì You've said we should have bombed the 'right people' after 9/11 and have suggested that the government has evidence Saudi Arabia was involved. Do you think we should have instead bombed Saudi Arabia?
This is smoking gun, undeniable proof that CNN is in the tank for Hillary Clinton 'ì and the rest of the mainstream media is no different.
In fact, the Clinton campaign is acting as an assignment editor for the establishment media by telling reporters what to cover 'ì and what to bury from public view that would otherwise hurt Hillary.
Previous Wikileaks emails revealed that campaign staffers are directly working with mainstream 'journalists' to develop news stories favorable to the campaign 'ì before they're published!
'Huffington Post is doing a piece on our treasurer Jose Villareal 'î will likely focus at least partially on him sitting on the Walmart board,' said campaign communications staffer Jesse Lehrich in a 2015 email , which reads like a reporter assignment list at a major newspaper. 'Other outstanding stories include: [Buzzfeed correspondent] Ruby Cramer on our grassroots organizing, Anita Kumar (McClatchy) on where we have organizers and how we've spent our money during Q2, and [Washington Post reporter] Phil Rucker on HRC talking about gun violence prevention.'

The FBI won't overturn its decision to not charge Hillary Clinton over her illegal activities involving classified emails, according to FBI Director James Comey.
Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) broke the news on Twitter:
FBI Dir just informed us 'Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Sec Clinton'
We, here at the EU Times have reported back on 30 October 2016 that we believe the 2nd investigation is just a scam because if James Comey really wanted to indict Hillary Clinton then he would have done so back in July 2016 when he first investigated her.
Here's a quote from our previous article, WE NAILED IT!
James Comey did not provide any recent proof he stumbled upon and neither will he until the election is over. Yes he's technically not allowed to but he could just indict Hillary in a second if he truly wanted just for lying to the FBI or wiping the server to get rid of all the evidence after receiving a congressional subpoena.
Unfortunately we got it all wrong regarding the reason on why he reopened the investigation. We thought he did so just to protect himself from a possible Trump victory followed by a retaliation. We thought he would keep the case opened until after the election and then support the winner. We were wrong'¶
We did however predict that he was being blackmailed live on TV without anyone even noticing it, when Clinton said: 'I'm confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July.' Whatever they are? Including crime and whatever is found? Such a declaration is a public warning to Comey.
So it appears that James Comey is totally in the sack for the Clintons. Only God knows what they have on him. The real reason on WHY he reopened the investigation has been told to Alex Jones of Infowars by Larry Nichols also on 30 October 2016 (top video).
Like the EU Times, Larry Nichols also predicted that the new investigation is a sham and he also nailed the reason. He told Alex the FBI reopened the investigation only to distract the media from Wikileaks. He even told Alex that by Saturday or Sunday before the elections, Comey would close the case and declare her innocent again. Larry Nichols also said that James Comey is compromised because the Clintons have heavy dirt on him which they use for blackmail.
Republican Representative Trey Gowdy also predicted the exact same thing . He also said that the 2nd FBI investigation on Hillary is a sham and that there will be no indictment with Loretta Lynch ordering around.
As a fun fact, all Democrats are praising James Comey now while only a few days ago they were calling him 'Russian Agent' and ' Disgusting White Males '.

A gravely written Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) report circulating in the Kremlin this morning is warning the Security Council ( SC ) that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) has now placed upwards of 300,000 of its military forces on 'high alert' that this Western alliance's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg claims is due to growing tensions with Russia 'îbut that Federation intelligence analysts state are intended to be used, instead, for a full-scale invasion of the United States to prevent Donald Trump from assuming the presidency. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, MoD intelligence analysts became 'concerned/alarmed' over a 25 October US military joint air defense exercise in the Arabian Sea that coordinated US Navy aircraft carrier defense of US Air Force transport and refueling aircraft'îbut that further analysis revealed was but a precursor to a much larger planned American military 'event' scheduled for 14 December as part of the Pentagon's planning for the upcoming inauguration of their next president.
The Pentagon's planning for their 14 December 'event', this report continues, involves the Atlantic Ocean deployment between the United States and European Union of the aircraft carriers USS George H.W. Bush , USS George Washington and USS Abraham Lincoln whose fighter aircraft will be defending the US Air Forces' Air Mobility Command's ( AMC ) staggering deployment of 200 KC-135 Stratotanker air-to-air fueling aircraft, 150 C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft, 150 C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and 75 C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft'îall of which are 'planned/scheduled' to leave the US empty, and return fully loaded.
Raising MoD 'fears/concerns' even more about this planned Pentagon 'event', this report notes, is all of the US military commanders involved in it being given copies of a cryptically written Executive Order signed by President Obama 3 days ago (4 November) that states ' global health security is a core tenet of our national strategy for countering biological threats ' and directs the US Defense Department and US Secretary of State to cooperate, coordinate and communicate with unnamed foreign defense ministries .
With relations between the United States and the equally globalist European Union hanging in the balance as the majority of the EU's leaders fear a Donald Trump presidency , this report continues, many in the US are openly warning that Hillary Clinton, and the leftist forces loyal to her, are preparing to stage a ' false flag ' attack to regain their hold on power'îincluding one of the most feared and powerful American political operatives named Roger Stone who is, likewise, openly warning it could very well happen.
As to why Hillary Clinton fears a Donald Trump presidency, MoD intelligence analysts in this report explain, is due to the massive exposure to the American public of her many crimes'îincluding her cover-up of child rape and sex trafficking.
Making Hillary Clinton's dire situation even worse, this report continues, was FBI Director James Comey, yesterday, basically informing her that he wasn't prepared to indict her for her email crimes'îbut that US government 'deep state' sources are now leaking was a 'ploy/gambit' to keep President Obama from pardoning her before Donald Trump could assume the presidency.
With Hillary Clinton having disgraced the entire journalism profession in America for decades to come, this report says, these propagandists crimes against the citizens of US continue to astound the whole world'îincluding the once respected television news network CNN now being proven to have colluded with Clinton to destroy Donald Trump.
But to one of the greatest crimes against the American people these Hillary Clinton propagandist journalists are responsible for, this report says, is their failing to tell them that her top aide, Huma Abedin, is, in fact, an imbedded spy bought and paid for by Saudi Arabia that the Federation has warned the US government about for decades.
But to the shockingly worse crime being committed against the American people, this report concludes, is President Obama himself now openly calling for all illegal immigrants in the United States to vote for Hillary Clinton, and pledging that the corrupt government he now controls will do nothing about it.
And though not mentioned in this MoD report, there are no greater examples of how corrupt the Obama-Clinton regime has made America then the cases of a young California single mother named Mariza Reulas who is facing years in prison for the crime of selling a single supper to a member of her ladies food club and the destruction of MIT professor Cesar Hidalgo for daring to tell to the truth about Clinton's emails'îboth occurring while Hillary Clinton, and all of the criminals associated with her, are still able to walk free'îbut if Donald Trump is allowed to survive he may be able to save, along with the United States itself.

As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton routinely asked her maid to print out sensitive government e-mails and documents 'î including ones containing classified information 'î from her house in Washington, DC, e-mails and FBI memos show. But the housekeeper lacked the security clearance to handle such material.
In fact, Marina Santos was called on so frequently to receive e-mails that she may hold the secrets to E-mailgate 'î if only the FBI and Congress would subpoena her and the equipment she used.
Clinton entrusted far more than the care of her DC residence, known as Whitehaven, to Maria Santos who is a Filipina immigrant. She expected the Filipino immigrant to handle state secrets, further opening the Democratic presidential nominee to criticism that she played fast and loose with national security.
Clinton would first receive highly sensitive e-mails from top aides at the State Department and then request that they, in turn, forward the messages and any attached documents to Santos to print out for her at the home.

√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGet ready for war with Russia√¢‚Ç¨¬ù if Hillary Clinton is elected president, said progressive Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThis election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Stein warned, explaining that Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s trigger-happy militarism √¢‚Ç¨≈ìis a mushroom cloud waiting to happen.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
While Stein adamantly opposes a Trump presidency, she explained that the dangers posed by a Clinton presidency are √¢‚Ç¨≈ìarguably even more immediate and intense.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Stein blasted Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwarmongering√¢‚Ç¨¬ù that √¢‚Ç¨≈ìalmost singlehandedly√¢‚Ç¨¬ù brought us the turmoil in Libya and could lead us into a nuclear war if Clinton were elected president.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHillary brought us Libya almost singlehandedly,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Stein explained in a Thursday Fox Business interview. She continued:
And she has said that she will lead the charge with a no-fly zone in Syria, and that basically amounts to a declaration of war against Russia, who is there under international law, having been invited by the sitting government. Like it or not, Russia has the sanction of international law to be there. For us to go in and declare a no-fly zone means get ready for war with Russia. Both of us have 2,000 nuclear weapons on hair trigger alert. This is the most dangerous moment√¢‚Ç¨' according to the former president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, who, two weeks ago, said this is the most dangerous nuclear moment ever.
Stein elaborated on this view during a Facebook Live interview with progressive Marc Lamont Hill, who has endorsed Stein over Clinton: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIn this election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Stein said, adding:
Not only in regards to climate, not only in regards to these expanding wars where Hillary has this proven track record √¢‚Ç¨≈ö of the most pro-conflict military policy as possible, and she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s calling for a no-fly zone in Syria, which means we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re essentially declaring war on Russia if Hillary gets elected√¢‚Ç¨'declaring war on Russia at a time when we have 2,000 nuclear weapons between us and the Russians on hair trigger alert. This is a mushroom cloud waiting to happen. So it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s really important right now for us to stand up and start building a force to do the right thing.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo one should fool themselves into thinking that the dangers will be smaller, that they will be mitigated in any way for having Hillary in White House. In some ways, they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re arguably even more immediate and intense,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Stein said. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut the dangers will be mitigated if we have created a strong force and we stand up loud and clear and we have a political base for this social movement that is coming together across this country and, really, across the world√¢‚Ç¨'this movement that puts people, planet, and peace over profit.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s very clear what kind of a trend we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re on,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Stein explained:
This is a race to the bottom between the greater and lesser evil. Where is the exit strategy if you buy into this [idea that one must vote for one of the major parties]? It means that in every election, we have two candidates that are more corporatist, more militarist, more imperialist, more economic elites, more serving Wall Street, offshoring our jobs, more of these rigged corporate trade agreements, more of this climate policy. √¢‚Ç¨≈ö There is no exit strategy if you buy into the lesser evil. It means with each race, we come closer and closer to the cliff.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe must find and elect alternatives to the Wall Street-backed oligarchy, the warmongers, and the anti-humanitarians,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Stein wrote on Twitter.
Stein, who has previously described Clinton as √¢‚Ç¨≈ìQueen of corruption,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù attacked Clinton for her questionable ties to Qatar and Saudi Arabia:
During her interview with Stein, Fox Business host Kennedy blasted other members of the mainstream media for ignoring and trying to √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsmother√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Stein√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √¢‚Ç¨≈ìauthentic√¢‚Ç¨¬ù and √¢‚Ç¨≈ìinteresting√¢‚Ç¨¬ù candidacy.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m surprised that the mainstream media has taken an interesting, authentic candidate like yourself√¢‚Ç¨' they were so obsessed with Bernie Sanders√¢‚Ç¨' and you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got someone, the embodiment of this new and interesting political tapestry, and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve essentially ignored you and smothered your candidacy,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Kennedy said.
Stein agreed and said that the corporate media√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s blackout of her campaign and their perpetuation √¢‚Ç¨≈ìspeaks volumes.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù She said, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMy campaign is a very inconvenient truth that there is a politics of integrity out there. √¢‚Ç¨≈ö Every day, there are more revelations how both √¢‚Ç¨≈ö [Trump and Clinton] are walking, talking scandal machines, and people are clamoring for something else.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù She added, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe corporate media, the apologists for the Democrats and Republicans, and the political pundits are doing everything they can to intimidate people into voting for the system that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s throwing them under the bus.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù

On Sunday evening, side-by-side images of Hillary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s campaign chairman John Podesta and his brother Tony next to police sketches of potential suspects in a 2007 kidnapping of a three-year-old girl took over the internet.
The resemblance is striking, and Reddit, 4chan, and Twitter rapidly took up the case.

Madeleine Beth McCann should have celebrated her 13th birthday with her family in England this year, but she vanished from her bed during a family vacation to Portugal in 2003. The case gripped the entire world, becoming one of the most high profile missing persons cases in history. Coverage of her kidnapping was comparable to the press interest in the death of Princess Diana.
Her parents had been out with friends at the hotel restaurant approximately 200 feet from where the child had been sleeping. When her mother Kate McCann went to check on her around 11 pm, but she was gone.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe go to bed every night with the agonising feeling that just maybe tomorrow we will find something to lead us back to Madeleine. To let us know what happened. To give us hope,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Kate McCann, who is now an ambassador for Missing People, said at the launch of a new nonprofit organization called Find Every Child, in London this week .
Though it has been nearly a decade since their little girl vanished, the family has continued the search, and believe that there is a possibility that she may still be alive.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhen my little girl first disappeared, on that horrendous night that changed our lives forever, I could never have imagined that nearly 10 years later we would still be in the same position,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù she continued.
In 2013, five years after Portuguese police had closed the case, they reopened it and revealed two new police sketches. It was believed that they were supposed to be of the same man, but from two different witnesses. Reddit and others on social media are now asking, what if it was actually two different men, and what if it was the Podestas?

IRAQI Christians will pray for Donald Trump's election victory after they condemned US Government for 'abandoning' them to the barbaric terror of Islamic State.
The Christian community in the latest Iraqi town to be freed from ISIS have opened up about how they were terrorised at the hands of the twisted jihadi militants.
The once-bustling Qaraqosh, which boasted of more than 50,000 Christian residents, was recaptured from the jihadis last week.
Residents who stayed in the town have described how ISIS told every Christian to pay a massive tax, convert to Islam or face execution.
Those who survived the terror have now voiced their outrage that President Obama refused to protect them when Iraq's largest Christian city fell to ISIS more than two years ago.
A man in the village said he hopes Donald Trump 'ì a widely favoured candidate in the town 'ì will bring a different approach to Iraqi Christians.
He told the camera: 'Obama has never helped the Christians. In fact, he despises them. In the last 26 months, he has shown he despises all of them.
'But we have hope in the new president, Trump.'

Donald Trump has previously spoken up about how Christians have been left to fend for themselves by the US government.
A Catholic priest in the town said: 'The US government led by President Obama could have protected us 'ì or at least helped us to protect ourselves.
'But unfortunately Obama abandoned us, and chose not to get involved.'
A young girl wearing a crucifix then added: 'We hope this new guy called Trump will help us more than Obama did.'
Last Sunday, Father Ammar took mass in a shelled-out Church of the Immaculate Conception for the first time in two years.
He said: 'Yes, they destroyed and burned some houses and churches, but we can rebuild them.
'After being away for exactly 811 days, after being attacked by the forces of evil, we have come back to worship in freedom.
'What counts is that we can pray here again'
The church, still largely in rubble from the chaotic war, is Iraq's largest and used to regularly host more than 3,000 people a week to its Sunday mass
The liberation comes as Kurdish-led forces fight to free both of ISIS' largest remaining strongholds 'ì Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria.

WikiLeaks has published its 33rd tranche of emails from the hacked account of Hillary Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s campaign chairman, John Podesta.
The whistleblowing organization has now published more than 55,600 emails in a series of daily online releases which it said were building towards the November 8 presidential election.
Emails released Sunday included messages accusing Chelsea Clinton of using Clinton Foundation funds for her wedding as well as leaked transcripts of Bill Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fundraising speeches.
WikiLeaks has claimed its email publishing servers suffered a sustained DoS attack after it released #DNCLeak2 over the weekend.
THERE ARE 2 ADDITIONAL LEAKS ADDED TO THIS STORY COMPARED TO THE STANDARD RT STORY. THEY ARE AT THE BOTTOM.
Goldman Sachs speeches 
In an email from January 23, 2016 Clinton Research Director Tony Carrk quoted the Democratic presidential nominee apparently expressing little appetite for prosecuting rogue Wall Street bankers.
In the mail to Clinton campaign Director of Communications Jennifer Palmieri, Press Secretary Brian Fallon and Podesta, Carrk said he was sending excerpts from Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Goldman Sachs speeches.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI'm not interested in, you know, turning the clock back or pointing fingers,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Clinton is reported to have told Tim O√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢Neill, formerly of SJU Wall Street Trading Room and Credit Suisse, following a paid speech.
Clinton apparently then went on to recommend that the financial sector take a leading role in setting out regulations for their own troubled industry: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry. There's nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Less than one year earlier, Democratic media adviser Mandy Grunwald suggested to Podesta in another communication leaked Monday that Clinton should take a conciliatory tone with regard to Wall Street.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI would include something from the Maggie Haberman piece on HRC's Goldman Sachs speech,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù writes Grunwald.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSomething like, 'When HRC recently spoke to bankers at Goldman Sachs, instead of holding them accountable for their activities that crashed the economy, she told them that banker bashing was foolish and had to stop. She said 'soothing' that we all got into our economic problems together.'
√¢‚Ç¨ÀúIllegal ivory√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ as leverage on China 
Hillary Clinton directed her now-campaign chair Podesta to use reports of illegal elephant tusk smuggling by Chinese government officials as √¢‚Ç¨≈ìleverage√¢‚Ç¨¬ù during a 2014 White House visit to the nation.
Three days before President Obama√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s visit to Beijing in November 2014, the former secretary of state highlighted a NY Times article on how Chinese delegates reportedly smuggled home poached ivory from Tanzania.
A message from Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hrod17@clintonemail.com opens by praising Podesta√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √¢‚Ç¨≈ìteasing√¢‚Ç¨¬ù of reporters and √¢‚Ç¨≈ìflashes√¢‚Ç¨¬ù of a smile at a recent press conference before asking the then-White House adviser to raise the ivory story with China√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s president directly.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOn China, I know you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be in Beijing next week, so am sending a news report about how Xi√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s official party on its visit to Tanzania loaded up their planes w poached ivory, likely w full knowledge of [President Jakaya] Kikwete√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s government,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Clinton writes.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìPlease raise this issue directly w XI, both because it is critical on the merits but also because it's another way you can gain some leverage with the Chinese.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
The email subject line was, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBelow is what I sent POTUS on election and China poaching.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
A √¢‚Ç¨Àúfact sheet√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ provided by the White House regarding Obama√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s visit shows discussions centered on the ebola crisis, economic relations, and a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìshared vision for Afghanistan.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù An effort to work together to √¢‚Ç¨≈ìstop the trade in illegal wildlife products√¢‚Ç¨¬ù is also mentioned.
Clinton √¢‚Ç¨Àútotally blew√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ crime question 
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio thought Clinton √¢‚Ç¨≈ìtotally blew√¢‚Ç¨¬ù a debate question about her support for a controversial federal crime bill passed by her husband.
In a March 2016 email , de Blasio was less than impressed with Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s attempt to pass off a question on mass incarceration to her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders back in March.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHillary was fantastic on the gun control answer, then totally blew the mass incarceration question,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù de Blasio wrote to Podesta.
The question was posed during a live CNN debate by anchor Don Lemon, who asked Clinton why black people should trust her to end a pattern of mass incarceration when she supported a 1994 law which many blame for √¢‚Ç¨≈ìlocking up a generation of black men.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Clinton began her answer by reminding people that Sanders also supported the bill, a tactic which appears to have irked Mayor de Blasio.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhy on Earth did she say √¢‚Ç¨ÀúAre you going to ask Senator Sanders that question?√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ instead of just addressing the issue,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù de Blasio wrote.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhen she makes it about her, she loses the high ground. Stating the obvious, I know, but she keeps doing it√¢‚Ç¨≈ö√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Podesta brothers plan to influence India on NGO clampdown 
Podesta sought to enlist the help of his lobbyist brother to influence an Indian Intelligence Bureau crackdown on Greenpeace and a key donor, the Ford Foundation, Monday√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s leaked emails reveal.
Correspondence between John and Tony Podesta from May 2015 show the pair planned a lunch with the Indian ambassador to discuss a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìvery serious situation√¢‚Ç¨¬ù facing Greenpeace in which the Indian government accused the group of financial irregularities. The claims eventually led to the cancellation of its license to operate there.
The bid to influence India√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s decision-making came at the request of Karen Sack, managing director of conservation group Ocean Unite, who asked if John Podesta could get in touch with his brother at The Podesta Group.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìApparently The Podesta Group has the contract for the Republic of India in the US, but Kumi [Naidoo, Greenpeace executive director] has no way to reach Tony or another principal,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Sack writes.
John Podesta forwarded the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsmall request√¢‚Ç¨¬ù to his brother, highlighting Kumi Naidoo√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s large following globally.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWant to talk to the head of Greenpeace? Kumi Naidoo is a very well known South African with a big international following, but I think the GOI [Government of India] likely to stick it to them.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
He also explained he was trying to use his influence to help the Ford Foundation charity, which had similarly √¢‚Ç¨≈ìgot on the wrong side of GOI√¢‚Ç¨¬ù. However, he expressed a belief that their issue √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcan be more easily resolved.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
A reply from Tony Podesta proposes a lunch with an Indian ambassador as well as confirmation he would be √¢‚Ç¨≈ìhappy√¢‚Ç¨¬ù to talk to Greenpeace.
A leaked July 2015 email about funding shows Podesta describing global charity the Ford Foundation as a √¢‚Ç¨≈ì mainstay √¢‚Ç¨¬ù for the Center for American Progress think-tank, which he founded in 2003.
Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s emails could √¢‚Ç¨Àúeither win 49 states, or lose 49 states√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 
As previously reported , in March of 2015, Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s camp were debating whether Hillary should make a joke about her √¢‚Ç¨≈ìemail situation√¢‚Ç¨¬ù.
Staffers were √¢‚Ç¨≈ìnervous√¢‚Ç¨¬ù about the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìpotentially nuts√¢‚Ç¨¬ù move and, in freshly leaked correspondence, sought advice from Philippe Reines √¢‚Ç¨' a former senior adviser from Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s days as Secretary of State and someone who was likely privy to the contents of said emails.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìTrust me, most of the email themselves are funnier than any joke we can come up with. Read in total by America she would either win 49 states, or lose 49 states. I go back and forth,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù said Reines.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut I would not make a joke just for the sake of making a joke, because email retention = Benghazi,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù he warned.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t jam State to release them at this point, but if Dan [Schwerin, Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s speech writer] can think of a light way to say √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI am proud of the work we did at State and hopefully at some point everyone will be able to read what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s in them as a way to better understand that work√¢‚Ç¨≈ö√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Reines suggested.
Bernie Sanders is a Jerk 
We have previously reported about the agreement between Bernie Sanders and Clinton Campaign. We have also previously reported about Hillary's others insults about Bernie's supporters: basement-dwellers, bucket of losers, stupid millennials, etc. but now here's another one.
This email is part of the DNC Leaks not of Podesta. DNC insider Hilary Rosen was caught emailing Jon Reinish and telling him that 'Bernie Sanders is a petty jerk': yes, she has a statement coming out. he is a petty jerk
Trump is right, Megyn Kelly is a Bimbo 
Another DNC Leak email says that Donald Trump is right about Megyn Kelly. Yes she is a BIMBO! Well well well but you freaks of nature were saying Trump is a sexist for saying that. Then that means you too are sexists you Democrat liars.

In a video released by Project Veritas, James O√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢Keefe exposes what everyone except Democrats have known to be true. There is a lot of voter fraud.
In the video, NYC Democratic Commissioner of the Board of Elections Alan Schulkin is caught on hidden camera at a United Federation of Teachers holiday party admitting that there is widespread voter fraud in New York City.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYeah, they should ask for your ID. I think there is a lot of voter fraud,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù said Schulkin, who elaborated on the types of voter fraud that are taking place in New York.
Voter fraud has been labeled as a right-wing myth by the left, but Schulkin, a Democrat, confirmed everyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worst fears, going against the grain of his own party.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou know, I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s too much to ask somebody to show some kind of an ID√¢‚Ç¨≈öLike I say, people don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t realize, certain neighborhoods in particular they bus people around to vote,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù said Schulkin.
When asked about which type of neighborhoods the busing of voters takes place in, Schulkin confirmed that it was minority neighborhoods, adding, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthey get busses and they move people around.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Schulkin expressed concern over voter fraud and suggested that Mayor Bill de Blasio was to blame for a lot of the voter fraud taking place in New York City.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe gave out ID cards. De Blasio. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s in lieu of a driver√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s license, but you can use it for anything. But, they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t vet people to see who they really are. Anybody can go in there and say I am Joe Smith, I want an ID card. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s absurd. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a lot of fraud. Not just voter fraud, all kinds of fraud.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Despite having disapproval with de Blasio√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s faulty ID program and widespread voter fraud, Schulkin also expressed concerns over safety in the polling locations as well as the potential for voter fraud, specifically with regards to Muslims wearing burkas.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey detonate bombs in the public schools, which we are using. That could disrupt the whole election√¢‚Ç¨≈öYour vote doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even count, because they can go in there with a burka and you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if they are a voter.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
It is clear after listening to a New York City Democratic Election Commissioner that the Democrats are in denial of the fraud that surrounds them. Schulkin confirms that voter ID laws are something that New York City desperately needs as a way to curb voter fraud.

Last December, Project Veritas caught NYC Democratic Commissioner of the Board of Elections Alan Schulkin on hidden camera at a United Federation of Teachers holiday party admitting that there is widespread voter fraud in New York City. He explained how Muslims can use burkas as a way to commit voter fraud.
Project Veritas wanted to test this theory by sending an undercover journalist dressed in full burka to Huma Abedin's polling location to see if they could vote. Shockingly, an election official offered the PV journalist Huma Abedin's ballot.
PV Journalist: 'Not even just voter ID because of people voting twice, but people can like cover their faces, you know what I'm saying?'
Alan Schulkin: 'The Muslims can do that too. You don't know who they are.'
PV Journalist: 'The Muslims, yeah. Especially, all those Burkas. Someone could claim oh it's my religion, but you don't know if they are pretending or not.'
Alan Schulkin: 'Exactly.'
Alan Schulkin: 'Your vote doesn't even count even, because they can go in there with a burka and you don't know if they are a voter. Your vote gets discounted because they come in there with a burka on and they can vote. People think that it's a liberal thing to do, but I take my vote seriously, and I don't want ten other people coming in negating my vote by voting for the other candidate when they aren't even registered voters.'
Election Offical: 'Goodmorning. Last name.'
PV Journalist: 'Abedin.'
Election Official: 'Abedin.'
Election Official: 'And that's your last name?'
Election Official: 'And how do you spell Abedin?'
PV Journalist: 'A B E DI N.'
Election Official: 'I don't know honey. I'm looking for it in the books. But your name is not in the book. For some reason it's not here, but that doesn't mean you can't vote by paper ballot. You just can't vote by machine'
PV Journalist: 'Ok so I can vote today?'
Election Official: 'By paper.'
PV Journalist: 'So I can vote as Huma Abedin, but just with the paper ballot?'
Election official: 'If that's the name you voted with in the last election, and you haven't changed your name?'

Donald Trump is appealing to the black voters. Brunell Donald-Kyei came on FOX Business Lou Dobbs show and said that Donald Trump wants to make a new contract with African Americans and Latino Americans.
From the National Diversity Coalition for Trump Brunell Donald-Kyei and Bruce Levell break down Donald Trump's support for minority communities.
Donald Trump said: Look, I'm not Jay-Z, I'm not JayLo, I'm not Trina, I'm not trying to entertain you but what I am saying is look I have a contract with African-American and Latinos, I want to put $100 billion into your communities over the next 8 years and not only that, I'm gonna put $20 billion into School Choice.
So basically what happened is, black people are waking up better hearing Donald Trump's messages now, you got to remember the mainstream media a lot of them, not FOX, but they been calling him a racist, a the divider and all of these things, in an attempt to walk away from the fact that Hillary Clinton nor does the president have a record of doing anything for our innercities whether be blacks or Latinos.
Brunell Donald-Kyei asked blacks and latinos to try something new this time around, she said: Vote Trump and put that $100 billion dollars, that $20 billion that Donald Trump is offering, make him prove it to you, give him 4 years, give him a chance. We need that money for our communities, we need it!
Trump basically saying: I'm gonna make your communities prosperous.
Donald Trump has a great message.

David Franzoni, the writer of Gladiator, announced that he wants to cast Leonardo DiCaprio in the role of Rumi in an upcoming bio-pic about the medieval Persian poet . Franzoni has also suggested casting Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Rumi's mentor and dear friend, Shams of Tabriz. White liberals, 'people of color' and others partial to de-colonial theory are at it again claiming that white people have misappropriated something 'ì or in this case, someone 'ì of their own. Hurling accusations of 'whitewashing' at Franzoni and Hollywood, they are trending the hashtag #RumiWasntWhite . 
In fact, Rumi was white. He was an ethnic Persian who wrote the vast majority of his world-renowned poetry in his native language. The Persians are the cultural-historically dominant subgroup of the ethnic and linguistic grouping of Iranian peoples, which also includes the native peoples of the Caucasus region (especially in Azerbaijan and Ossetia), the Kurds, Pashtuns, and Balochis among others. The so-called 'Tajiks' of Central Asia (present-day northern Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and part of Uzbekistan) are simply Persians who have been given another name by 19th century British and Russian colonialists who schemed to colonize this area of Iran. 
It is not just any area either. Known as 'Khorasan' or sunrise land in Persian, this is where the majority of native Persian scientists and poets of the so-called 'Islamic Golden Age' hailed from. It is also Rumi's birthplace. Stan means province in Persian. Afghanistan and the rest of the stans in that region are totally artificial nation-states, which is partly why they are so dysfunctional. The Persian spoken in the stans is referred to as 'Dari' (Parsie Darbari or 'Tajiki') because it was the courtly (Darbari) language of the Crown (Taj). 
The Persians and other Iranians never called their realm 'the Persian Empire' or referred to their country as 'Persia.' This was an ancient Greek designation that caught on in the West. When, in 1935, Reza Shah Pahlavi asked Westerners to refer to his country by its proper name he meant to remind the West that 'Iran' is shorthand for Iran Shahr, a middle Persian form of the ancient Persian Aryana Khashatra or 'Aryan Imperium.' To this day, many natives of the part of Khorasan that Rumi hails from refer to their land as Aryana. The first recorded usage of the term 'Aryan' is in the rock carved inscriptions of ancient Persian Emperors such as Darius and Xerxes, who used to sign their decrees: 'I am a Persian, son of a Persian'¶ an Aryan of Aryan lineage.' 
These men were white and they established the most tolerant, humanitarian, and constructive form of government in pre-modern times, which at its zenith counted nearly 1 out of every 2 people on Earth among its subjects. I am not even counting the realms governed by Scythians and Sarmatians, northern Iranian tribes who refused the Empire, and rode freely in an area from the Ukraine to the Gobi. Their warrior women became the basis for Greek legends about the Amazons. The Persians and their northern cousins were phenotypically identical to modern Europeans, having all descended 'ì ethnically and linguistically 'ì from the same Indo-European or Caucasian community of prehistory. 
It is only beginning with the catastrophic Arab invasion of Iran Shahr in the 7th century AD that Iran's ethnic composition began to be forcibly altered. (The Hellenistic colonization of the Persian Empire did not have this effect, since the Greeks were fellow Aryans.) Consistent with their messenger's mandate in the Quran, after burning libraries, mutilating art, and massacring urban populations, these half-savage desert tribesmen took to enslaving and selling Persian women at public markets. Two centuries of Persian insurgency, especially in the Azerbaijan and Mazandaran regions, ended in defeat. The Zoroastrian mystics who led this Khorramdinan ('those of the Joyous Religion') insurgency 'ì a continuation of ancient Persia's Mazdakite sect 'ì donned the cloak of Islam in order to survive. They were badly persecuted nonetheless, since the idea of esoteric (Bateni) interpretation (Zand) is declared heresy by the Quran itself 'ì which insists that its legal injunctions are clear, perfect, and unalterable. These Batenis or Zandiqs were the nucleus of the Sufi movement whose epitomizing voice Rumi eventually becomes. 
When he was born in 1207, Khorasan was still ethnically white. Some of the region's illustrious scientists were forced to pen their treatises in Arabic, rather than in their native Persian, because their research was being commissioned by Arabs (who at first just tried to wipe out Persian science). However, Persian remained the language of poetry and the Persian poets of Khorasan, especially Ferdowsi, actually saved the Iranian national identity by maintaining the linguistic structure that enfolded an Aryan modality of thought within itself, and by fostering the kind of living tradition of ancient Indo-European lore that we see in the Shahnameh. The poets, and even the Iranian scientists forced to write in Arabic, effected a Persian Renaissance of sorts that both inspired and reinforced regional revolts that came to the brink of liberating large parts of Iran from the Arab Caliphate by the 11th century AD. 
Then the Turks and Mongols poured in from Asia in the 12th and 13th centuries, respectively. During Rumi's adolescence, the Mongol hordes rushed into Khorasan forcing his family to flee from Balkh in 1219 and head westwards across Iran, moving each time the Mongols advanced further. Entire cities were razed. Ultimately the Mongols would be responsible for a genocide of half 'ì yes, half 'ì of the Iranian population. The half that survived was subjected to plunder, rape, and forced miscegenation. Rumi ultimately wound up in Anatolia, which is where Mowlana Jalaluddin Balkhi picked up his nickname. Rum (pronounced Roum) is the Persian name for 'Rome', including the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantium 'ì so Rumi means 'the Roman'. Konya, where Rumi settled, was hardly Turkish when he arrived there. 
Easternmost Anatolia, the home of the Kurds, has always been ethnically and linguistically Iranian. This region, and the more central part of Anatolia in which Rumi's family settled, had only been conquered by the Seljuq Turks (which the Ottomans broke off of later on) for a little over a century. It was a conquest as bloodthirsty as the Mongol one (in fact, the Turks and Mongols are ethnically related), the most catastrophic consequence of which was the miscegenation of the population of Azerbaijan 'ì itself a Turkicized appellation for Azar Padegan or 'Fire Stronghold', that province of Iran in the Caucasus mountains that was thought to be the birthplace of Zarathustra (one reason why the insurgency against the Arab-Muslims was based there). From Baku to Tabriz, Azerbaijan was demographically white and it took centuries of Seljuq Turkish occupation to change this before Iranians re-conquered the area. So there is no reason whatsoever to think that Shams, the mentor from Tabriz that Rumi met in 1244, was other than a white man. He was certainly a native Persian speaker, and a newly arrived Seljuq Turk in Azerbaijan in those days would have spoken Turkish. 
The worst thing about the Turkish and Mongol invasions was not that they represented a second wave of miscegenation in a white nation already under Arab occupation, it is that both of these Asian conquerors adopted an orthodox form of Islam. Largely nomadic and illiterate tribes, unlike the highly-civilized Persians, the Mongols and Mongoloid Turks felt at home in the worldview of the Quran. One wonders how Rumi's mystical philosophy would have taken shape had he grown up in an Iran where the Persian Renaissance of the generation before him were to have continued. Iranians say, Masnavi√© Mowlavi ast Qor√¢n be zab√¢n√© Pahlavi, meaning 'the Mathnawi of Rumi is the Quran in Pahlavi.' The term Pahlavi refers to the middle Persian language of Pre-Islamic Iran, so that the saying suggests Rumi made out of Islam something tolerable to the Persian ethos. Of course, as I suggested above, Rumi only represents the culmination of this process, which I would describe as a kind of Sufi Stockholm Syndrome. A brutally colonized and terrorized population of 'very understanding' white folks come to identify with their hostage taker and begin to make excuses for him that are so good that he would never have been able to dream them up himself. So if there is any whitewashing going on, it is Rumi who whitewashed Islam. 
Some of the less vile people who have jumped on the #rumiwasntwhite bandwagon have tried to say that his ethnicity really does not matter, since his message is for all mankind. The fact is that a 'message for all mankind' (women included) is an Aryan idea in the first place, and a specifically Persian one at that. Ancient Greek writers and thinkers, like Herodotus and Xenophon, who lived under the Persian Empire knew that the opposition to slavery, religious tolerance, a humanitarian concern for the welfare of all peoples, and a Cosmopolitan openness to learning from other cultures were Persian ideals. They were grounded in the worship of Wisdom preached by Zarathustra and became state policy under Cyrus and Darius. This tradition survived the vicissitudes of centuries of history, influencing Roman Europe through Mithraism and guiding the statecraft of Khosrow Anoushiravan 'ì one of the late great Persian Emperors in the century before the Arab-Muslim Conquest of Iran. There is an agenda to erasing this heritage: it allows de-colonial theorists to claim that only non-white people can be colonized, and to demonize white colonialism by excluding the benevolent Persian Empire from the history of the white world. Iran's glorious history 'ì that of Rumi's folk 'ì puts the lie to their claim that Caucasian superiority in science, technology, and the arts always came at the expense of exploited non-white peoples. 
Despite Rumi's best efforts to whitewash Islam, anyone who has seriously studied Islamic scripture and law knows 'ì as he should have 'ì that this is apostasy: 'Love's creed is separate from all religions: the creed and denomination of Lovers is God.' 'Love's valley is beyond all religions and cults'¶ here there is no room for religions or cults.' What these verses sound like are the teachings of the Nizari Ismailis, better known as the Order of the Assassins, who actually did and still do claim that Rumi was secretly a preserver of their movement. The Nizaris adopted Persian as their liturgical language. They were the Sufis who remained truest to the Khorramdin teachings after the failed insurgency against the Arab invasion. In fact, they renewed the insurgency by waging a winning war against the Caliphate 'ì until the Turks and Mongols descended on Iran. 
#RumiWasWhite and so were all Persians and other Iranians before being colonized, genocided, raped, and plundered by Semitic Arabs and Asiatic Mongols and Turks 'ì half-savage peoples who parasitically appropriated the greatness of Iranian (i.e. Aryan) Civilization in the name of Islam. 
Besides even if Rumi wasn't white, what about 100% white roles played by black actors? Why the hell do we have movies with black vikings? Why is the heck was Heimdall played by a black actor named Idris Elba in the Thor movie? Where is the uproar there? Of course there's no uproar because there is an agenda in which whites are labeled 'evil' no matter what they do.

Hillary Clinton has been caught in yet another dirty trick in Wikileaks latest storm of email leaks.
The Democrats were planning to frame Donald Trump as a KGB-Russian agent and Putin puppet since April 2016.
Here's what Wikileaks email ID 27381 reveals:
We don't have a ton on Simes, but the pro-Russia stuff ties in pretty well to idea that Trump is too friendly with Putin/weak on Russia
Now what do you say about that? We always knew the accusations were false but now we have the proof. The Democrats are dirty! She is a disgusting filthy witch and a Soros puppet while we're at puppets!
Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump during the 3rd debate of being a 'Putin puppet' but if Trump is a Putin puppet just for wanting to be a friend with Russia and not do war with them, then what is Hillary Clinton to George Soros when she took all those dozens of millions of dollars from him? Her slave? His personal door mat?

Ohh God the horror! Trump is so evil for talking dirty and being horny on some pu**y tape 12 years ago so let's show the world how pure and divine we are by using the same language.
Liberals are such disgusting animals. No brains, no empathy, no logic, average 70 IQs, zero political knowledge but who cares? They are famous, they think they get a pass on whatever they do because of that.
They are truly the filth of the earth! Many Americans are struggling with their health plans, jobs, debt, foreclosures and everything but these privileged filthy human wastes are coming to lecture you, to tell you that you are a scumbag redneck for wanting change.
They are privileged wastes, remember that! They are not going through what you're going, they are tweeting hate from their multi-million dollar mansions while you're struggling to put food on the table.
They have ruined America. You think America's $20 Trillion debt is a joke? Who is going to pay it? Will these celebrity wastes pay your debt when the economy implodes? What happens when America will reach Zimbabwe's hyperinflation rates? You think Hillary will fix the economy? First of all she doesn't want to fix anything and second she wouldn't even know how to even if she wanted.
Open your eyes America, this is your last chance to stop your country from transforming into Brazil > Venezuela > Zimbabwe and finally North Korea. It would be a slow painful process but you have the power to put an end to it by voting for Trump today!

Leaked funding documents reveal an effort by George Soros and his foundations to manipulate election laws and process rules ahead of the federal election far more expansively than has been previously reported.
The billionaire and convicted felon moved hundreds of millions of dollars into often-secret efforts to change election laws, fuel litigation to attack election integrity measures, push public narratives about voter fraud, and to integrate the political ground game of the left with efforts to scare racial minority groups about voting rights threats.
These Soros-funded efforts moved through dozens of 501(c)(3) and (c)(4) charities and involved the active compliance with civil rights groups, government officials, and purportedly non-partisan groups like the League of Women Voters.
The leaked documents also reveal deliberate and successful efforts to manipulate media coverage of election issues in mainstream media outlets like the The New York Times.
Conservatives and Republicans have no opposing effort or source of funds that represents even a small fraction in opposition to level of the Soros-led manipulation contained in the leaked documents.
The documents reveal that the Soros campaign fueled litigation attacking election integrity measures, such as citizenship verification and voter ID. It funded long-term efforts to fundamentally transform election administration 'î including the creation of databases that were marketed to state governments for use in voter verification. It propped up left-leaning media to attack reports of voter fraud, and conducted racially and ideologically targeted voter registration drives.
The racially targeted voter registration drives were executed at the same time Soros dollars were funding other public relations efforts to polarize racial minority groups by scaring them about the loss of voting rights and the dangers of police officers.
The Soros documents reveal hundreds of millions of dollars being poured into the effort to transform the legal and media environment touching on elections. One document notes that poverty-alleviation programs are being de-emphasized for this new effort. It states: 'George Soros has authorized U.S. Programs to propose a budget of $320 million over two years, with the understanding that the annual budget for U.S. Programs will be $150 million beginning in 2013.'

A woman who accused Donald Trump of repeatedly raping her two decades ago when she was a 13-year-old aspiring teen model has again dropped a federal lawsuit over the alleged assaults.
The accuser, identified in the lawsuit by the pseudonym 'Jane Doe,' was expected to appear at a news conference in Los Angeles Wednesday, but that appearance was abruptly canceled.
The lawyer who organized the event, Lisa Bloom, said Trump's accuser had received threats and was too frightened to show up.
The accuser's lead attorney, Thomas Meagher of New Jersey, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. He filed a one-page notice dismissing the case Friday evening in federal court in Manhattan. No explanation was given for the action.
Bloom did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday.
Through his attorney, Trump had flatly denied the woman's allegations.
There was plenty of speculation 'î and skepticism 'î from social media users about the validity of the charges.
Hillary Clinton's niece came out for TRUMP because 'selfish' aunt wants to win for all the wrong reasons.

A sobering new Security Council ( SC ) analytical report on the US presidential election states that a new American Revolution has begun which today's popular vote is just the beginning of; and that could fully last up to an entire decade, especially if this election is stolen from Donald Trump. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, Federation intelligence analysts in their 'deciphering/uncovering' what the current US presidential election is really all about have heavily relied on 'outliers' [a thing situated away or detached from the main body or system] such as artificial intelligence ( AI ) models, social media trends and psychological analysis of the American electorate.
This report notes that the Security Councils use of these 'outliers' to both understand and explain what is occurring during this US presidential election provides the only proven scientific evidence of what is occurring as the so called polling data used by the American propaganda media has been proven to be nothing more than a manipulation device used to keep people from voting for or supporting the anti-establishment candidate Donald Trump.
Examples of this being true, this report explains, lie in too many examples to fully cite'îbut includes the once respected Monmouth University poll found manipulating data to favor Hillary Clinton , news networks NBC and CBS found manipulating polling data to show Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump when she was actually losing , and CNN manipulating their poll data to favor Hillary Clinton too .
Unlike manipulated polling data showing Hillary Clinton will win this election, however, this report continues, the objective and independent scientific 'outliers' used by Security Council research analysts show not only Donald Trump winning'îbut winning in a landslide victory.
Evidence proving this assertion of a Donald Trump US presidential win, this report notes, lies first with artificial intelligence analysis'îthat includes the MogIA supercomputer showing Trump winning in landslide and showing he is more popular than President Obama , and a just released AI computer simulation showing Trump winning with 289 electoral votes compared to Clinton's 249 .
Social media trend lines in this election, likewise, proves a Donald Trump landslide win in this election, this report continues, as his Facebook-Twitter-Instagram-YouTube 'presence' dwarfs Hillary Clinton's by a staggering 74 million 'îand that is further validated by the over 700,000 Americans who have come to his campaign rallies, as opposed to the barely 60,000 that have attended Hillary Clinton's .
Most fascinating though of the 'outliers' used in this Security Council report is the psychological analysis of the American electorate conducted by a virtually unknown US political project called ' We Need Smith ''îwhose scientifically conducted studies shockingly proved that anyone from a liberal Democrat, to a conservative Republican was able to win the US presidency as long as they promised to destroy the corrupt political system currently ruling America .
The 'We Need Smith' project, this report explains, is named after a popular US Great Depression era movie called Mr. Smith Goes To Washington about a newly appointed United States Senator who fights against a corrupt political system'îand that during this present US presidential election only Donald Trump and US Senator Bernie Sanders fit the mold of.
Critical to note about the 'We Need Smith' project too, this report continues, is that it was co-founded by the legendary American pollster Patrick Caddell 'îwho almost singlehandedly was responsible for putting President Jimmy Carter in office in 1976, but also presided over Carter's unprecedented defeat in 1980 at the hands of the US establishments most hated candidate Ronald Reagan.

Interestingly to note too, this report says, is Caddell's scientific analyses showing that the hatred of the American people towards their elites comes from both the left and right 'îand as evidenced by the equal explosive political movements known as Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party insurgencies .
This report grimly concludes, however, with a warning that Soviet Communist leader Joseph Stalin's attributed statement'î' Those who cast the votes decide nothing. Those who count the votes decide everything. ''îmay, indeed, be active in the present US presidential election after newly released secret documents revealed that Hillary Clinton's main supporter, multi-billionaire George Soros, has not only been manipulating the entire American election system , but one of his companies is, also, providing vote county software to 16 States ( they've since denied )'îand that should Donald Trump have this election stolen from him the people of that nation will most surely revolt.

WikiLeaks has released the 34th batch of emails from the hacked account of Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta, on the eve of the election. This latest tranche includes 888 communications.
Much of the latest emails' content repeats from previous WikiLeaks releases, because entire email threads are not always released at once.
'Needy Latinos' considered for VP 
In one leaked email, dated August 21, 2015 with the subject line 'Needy Latinos and 1 easy call,' Podesta writes to Clinton, 'A few calls you might consider making,' apparently in relation to potential vice president choices.
Podesta then names Federico Pena, Bill Richardson and South Carolina Governor Jim Hodges. The first two are presumably the 'needy Latinos.'
Pena, former secretary of the US Department of Transportation under President Bill Clinton, endorsed Barack Obama over Clinton for the 2008 election and served as his campaign chair. He is covered extensively in the email.
Podesta goes on to say that Pena's 'Cabinet stints ripped up his family,' and that Pena 'gave everything to the cause and no time to his family, he went through a messy divorce in the late 90's and was left really down and felt like no-one reached out to him then so he felt pretty cut off from Clinton World.'
Podesta, passing along all of this information after speaking with former Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, gives Clinton four steps in completing a call with Pena, writing: '1) you really enjoyed seeing Cindy at the Chambers event and appreciate her support. 2) ask him how he's been doing 3) ask about his views on the race and what she should be doing in Colorado 4) ask that he consider publicly supporting you.'
An email reply from Hillary Clinton herself reads: 'Agree about calls. Just a few additional points: several Latinos have asked that I consider Pena for VP.'
On Richardson, a former governor of New Mexico and US ambassador to the UN under President Clinton, Podesta writes that a recent phone call between Bill Clinton and Richardson went well, 'not withstanding the fact that [Richardson] can be a dick.'
'He had a good conversation with the President and has been good in his interviews since,' Podesta says of Richardson, telling Hillary that a call to Richardson ahead of his upcoming appearance on NBC's 'Meet the Press' might seal an endorsement.
Donna Brazile 
The extent of the cozy relationship between the Clinton campaign and CNN was revealed in an email from the former head of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile, which contained, almost verbatim, the wording of a question Clinton was to be asked at a town hall in Ohio.
Sent the day before the televised event, which aired on March 13, 2016, Clinton is given the wording for a question she will be asked regarding discrimination amongst trade unions.
Also included is the wording of a question her opponent Bernie Sanders is to be asked on income inequality.

According to a new Wikileaks email leak , a Clinton staffer has been caught ' sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch '.
Chicken is a code-word for children, babies among pedophile and satanic ranks.
Moloch is a Demon to which the ancient Jewish people of the past were caught by Moses while they were sacrificing their own babies when he was on top of Mount Sinai receiving the 10 Commandments from God.
Moses was so angry and upset that he broke the first set of the 10 Commandments! He condemned and damned everyone. He later went to the mountain again and got a second set of of the 10 Commandments.
In Leviticus 18:21 God forbid the chosen people to do such a horrible thing:
Do not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Moloch, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the LORD.
God also ordered in Leviticus 20:2 to 20:5 that any follower of Moloch must be put to death:
Say to the Israelites: 'Any Israelite or any foreigner residing in Israel who sacrifices any of his children to Moloch is to be put to death. The members of the community are to stone him.
I myself will set my face against him and will cut him off from his people; for by sacrificing his children to Moloch, he has defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name.
If the members of the community close their eyes when that man sacrifices one of his children to Moloch and if they fail to put him to death,
I myself will set my face against him and his family and will cut them off from their people together with all who follow him in prostituting themselves to Moloch.
This is NOT a joke people, this is serious SATANIST stuff and either you believe in God or not, it's your problem, but what matters is that these people DO BELIEVE IN WHAT THEY DO!
16 years ago, on 15 July 2000 Alex Jones was the first and only to date, to ever infiltrate and secretly videotape the Bohemian Grove . Guess what they were doing there'¶ Mock (or real?!?) sacrifices of children to Demon Moloch.

The 2016 US Presidential election has seen a coming together of hard-core Bush-era neocons and the anti-Bush liberal-left in support of the candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton.
The unofficial coalition, which looks likely to help propel the Democratic nominee to the White House (if the polls are to believed), will have surprised many, but it's not the first time self-identified progressives have 'ì wittingly or unwittingly 'ì aided the cause of the most reactionary people in western politics.
The neocons: a group of ultra-hawkish hard-right imperialists, who are quite happy for the US to illegally invade other sovereign states and drop bombs all over the world. The liberal-left: who profess their support for human rights, internationalism and progressive causes.
At first sight, these two groups don't appear to have much in common. But the truth is the liberal-left have for a long time been the accomplices of the endless war lobby.
Think back to 1999 and the US-led bombing of Yugoslavia. Never mind that the Balkan state was a multi-party democracy that operated an economy with very high levels of public/social ownership: the liberal-left cheered as bombs rained down on Belgrade, Nis and Kragujevac . Many 'progressives' swallowed hook, line and sinker the lurid claims of a 'genocide' being committed in the province of Kosovo, which were later dismissed by a UN court.
Although it was promoted as a 'humanitarian' venture, the bombing of Yugoslavia was in fact a hard-right project pushed by fiercely anti-socialist/anti-communist Cold War warriors.
It's worth noting the names on the Executive Committee of the 'Balkan Action Committee' which lobbied hard for war against Yugoslavia in 1999. They included Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rumsfeld 'ì three men we would all hear a lot more from in the build-up to war with Iraq.
The liberal-left were also broadly on board for the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, an assault we were told would greatly help women's rights.
However, in 2003, there was a break between most of the liberal-left and the neocons over the invasion of Iraq. This military aggression, unlike the one against Yugoslavia, was led by a Republican president. George W. Bush, the man at the helm, was too much of a Texan 'redneck' for educated liberal-leftists to support.
Progressives who had no problem with backing an illegal war against Yugoslavia, found they did have a problem backing an illegal war against Iraq.
In the end, the only 'liberals' who supported the Iraq invasion were neo-cons masquerading as liberals, and we all saw through their disguise.
In 2011, though it was 'business as usual' for the neocon/liberal-left alliance as a 'nice' Democrat administration helped destroy Libya 'ì the country which had the highest living standards in Africa 'ì and whose 'tyrannical' government provided free health care, education, and electricity to all of its citizens.
Again, this was a military assault which was pushed by neocons, the same crowd who'd lobbied for war against Yugoslavia and Iraq. Once again the liberal-left didn't seem to notice, or indeed to care, who was behind it.
The toppling of Muammar Gaddafi (the latest neocon-designated 'New Hitler' who was hell-bent on 'genocide'), would lead to a more democratic Libya with major advances in human rights, liberal-leftists assured us. In fact, the NATO attack on Libya turned the country into a failed state and a haven for jihadists.
Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State in 2011, played a prominent role in the destruction of Libya 'ì so much so that Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, in a recent interview with John Pilger, has labelled it 'Hillary's war.'
But Libya has been quietly forgotten during the Presidential election campaign, as indeed has the Iraq war.
Liberal-leftists who couldn't bear the sight of George W. Bush are lining up with pro-Iraq war hawks to try and get HRC elected.
Film-maker Michael Moore, who made the fiercely anti-Bush documentary, Fahrenheit 9-11, finds himself on the same side as Bush's speechwriter David Frum and Robert Kagan, co-founder of the Project for the New American Century. That would have seemed unthinkable a few years back, but it's happening today, folks.
Why are America's liberal-left doing this? It's not as if Trump or Clinton are the only options: Dr Jill Stein's policies on social justice, war and peace, and climate change are far more progressive than Clinton's. Why, instead of backing Stein, are they enabling Washington's war lobby again, just as they did in 1999 and in 2011 during the bombing of Libya? Don't they ever learn their lesson? How naive are liberals to be fooled by the sudden neo-con concern for 'women's rights' and the rights of immigrants and gay people?
Make no mistake, the PNAC crowd are backing Clinton, not because they are appalled at sexist/racist or politically incorrect statements made by Donald Trump, but because they believe HRC will be the candidate who is more likely to continue the policy of endless war. More specifically, in regards to Syria, they want a US President who will prioritize on toppling the secular government of President Assad 'ì not defeating ISIS. Trump's great 'crime' in their eyes is that he does want to prioritize on ISIS 'ì and horror of horrors 'ì to work with Russia to defeat terrorism.
As America goes to the polls today, the stakes could not be higher. Clinton's support for the imposition of a No-Fly Zone against Russian and Syrian aircraft risks starting World War Three, and the deaths of potentially hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people.
Is that what the 'progressives' who are lining up with the destroyers of Iraq really want?

Breaking all the breaking noise from the leftist media! Pundits, establishment scum, satanists, celebrities, filth of the Earth, party traitors and everyone who opposed Donald J Trump, bow down to the great 45th president of the United States of America!
BOW DOWN SCUM! YOU ARE ALL DEFEATED!
So far Donald Trump stands at 276 electors out of 270 needed to win the presidency. Counting is still going on in some states such as Arizona, New Hampshire, Michigan and Alaska. After counting is over in those states. Trump could very well exceed 300 electors.
This victory qualifies as a LANDSLIDE!
Donald Trump fought a long war, he was despised and hated by the media and by the establishment but he eventually won! Now its time for MAGA!
First and foremost we would like to thank GOD himself for helping the light to prevail against the dark! After years of darkness its finally time for light.
Second we congratulate Trump himself for all the hard-work and he did work very hard, speech after speech, little pause, little sleep. He deserves the victory!
Third we would like to thank each and every single small blog, forum, youtuber, news website and ourselves of course the EU Times which stood firm WITH Trump since day 1 when he first announced and to each and every single activist who helped propel Donald Trump to victory.
Fourth we would like to thank the American voter who was smart and ignored all the noise and hate against Donald Trump!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

A sobering new Security Council ( SC ) analytical report on the US presidential election states that a new American Revolution has begun which today's popular vote is just the beginning of; and that could fully last up to an entire decade, especially if this election is stolen from Donald Trump. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, Federation intelligence analysts in their 'deciphering/uncovering' what the current US presidential election is really all about have heavily relied on 'outliers' [a thing situated away or detached from the main body or system] such as artificial intelligence ( AI ) models, social media trends and psychological analysis of the American electorate.
This report notes that the Security Councils use of these 'outliers' to both understand and explain what is occurring during this US presidential election provides the only proven scientific evidence of what is occurring as the so called polling data used by the American propaganda media has been proven to be nothing more than a manipulation device used to keep people from voting for or supporting the anti-establishment candidate Donald Trump.
Examples of this being true, this report explains, lie in too many examples to fully cite'îbut includes the once respected Monmouth University poll found manipulating data to favor Hillary Clinton , news networks NBC and CBS found manipulating polling data to show Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump when she was actually losing , and CNN manipulating their poll data to favor Hillary Clinton too .
Unlike manipulated polling data showing Hillary Clinton will win this election, however, this report continues, the objective and independent scientific 'outliers' used by Security Council research analysts show not only Donald Trump winning'îbut winning in a landslide victory.
Evidence proving this assertion of a Donald Trump US presidential win, this report notes, lies first with artificial intelligence analysis'îthat includes the MogIA supercomputer showing Trump winning in landslide and showing he is more popular than President Obama , and a just released AI computer simulation showing Trump winning with 289 electoral votes compared to Clinton's 249 .
Social media trend lines in this election, likewise, proves a Donald Trump landslide win in this election, this report continues, as his Facebook-Twitter-Instagram-YouTube 'presence' dwarfs Hillary Clinton's by a staggering 74 million 'îand that is further validated by the over 700,000 Americans who have come to his campaign rallies, as opposed to the barely 60,000 that have attended Hillary Clinton's .

Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity Executive Director Daniel McAdams stated that Donald Trump's victory has proven the entire political class in Washington and especially the mainstream media that does their bidding to be completely out of touch with the American people.
The victory of Republican Party candidate Donald Trump in the US presidential elections proves that Washington's political class and the mainstream US media are completely detached from the actual US electorate, Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity Executive Director Daniel McAdams told Sputnik.
'More than anything else, Donald Trump's victory has proven the entire political class in Washington and especially the mainstream media that does their bidding to be completely out of touch with the American people,' McAdams said.
According to McAdams, over the course of the election, the mainstream media has proven not to be independent resources seeking out inconvenient truths, but rather 'a lapdog to the power elite.'
Earlier in the day, Trump won the US presidential elections despite most of the analysts and opinion polls predicting his defeat to Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton.

The threat of World War 3 is over! We can now breathe relaxed people! World War 3 will have to wait for another era! It is time for peace and prosperity.
RUSSIA 
Russia is ready and looks forward to restoring bilateral relations with the United States, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, commenting on the news of Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election.
'We heard [Trump's] campaign rhetoric while still a candidate for the US presidency, which was focused on restoring the relations between Russia and the United States,' President Putin said, speaking at the presentation ceremony of foreign ambassadors' letters of credentials in Moscow.
'We understand and are aware that it will be a difficult path in the light of the degradation in which, unfortunately, the relationship between Russia and the US are at the moment,' he added.
Speaking about the degraded state of relations between the countries, the president once again stressed that 'it is not our fault that Russia-US relations are as you see them.'
Earlier today, in a message to Donald Trump the Russian President expressed confidence that the dialogue between Moscow and Washington, in keeping with each other's views, meets the interests of both Russia and the US.
The Russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some 'burning issues that are currently on the international agenda, and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security,' RIA Novosti reported.
On top of it, Putin has expressed confidence that 'building a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each other's positions, meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.'
Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin has also expressed hope that Trump's victory in the presidential election will help pave the way for a more constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington.
'The current US-Russian relations cannot be called friendly. Hopefully, with the new US president a more constructive dialogue will be possible between our countries,' he said.
'The Russian Parliament will welcome and support any steps in this direction,' Volodin added on Wednesday.
A member of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security, Senator Aleksey Pushkov, has meanwhile noted that Hillary Clinton's stake on the conflict with Russia has eventually done her a terrible disservice.
'[Playing the] 'Russian card' and portraying Putin as a bad guy did not help Clinton. On the contrary, staking on the conflict with Moscow has only caused fear, doing her a disservice,' he tweeted.
According to many observers, US-Russia relations are now at their lowest point since the Cold War. Putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of Russia's relations with the US 'was not our choice,' however.
For things to improve between Moscow and Washington, the US should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect Russia's interests rather than try to dictate terms, Putin said last month.
The US will have to negotiate with Russia on finding solutions to international issues as no state is now able to act alone, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week, adding that problems in bilateral relations began to mount long before the Ukrainian crisis broke out in 2014.
FRANCE 
In France, Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has said that the election results mustn't weaken relations between Europe and the US, and assured that France remains an ally of the US, and will have to see what the new president's policies will be.
The leader of the French 'National front' party, Marine le Pen, has congratulated Trump on his win over Twitter, posting, 'Congratulations to the new US president Donald Trump and the free American people!'
ITALY 
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who had previously openly supported Hillary Clinton, congratulated Donald Trump and gave assurances that Italy's ties with the United States remain strong.
'I wish him well. The Italo-American friendship is solid,' Renzi said at the start of a speech in Rome.
UNITED KINGDOM 
UK Prime Minister Theresa May expressed readiness to work with Donald Trump 'building ties to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations.'
Nigel Farage, UK Independence Party leader, who was a figurehead in Britain's exit from the European Union, said Trump has fought a brave campaign.
'I hand over the mantle to @RealDonaldTrump! Many congratulations. You have fought a brave campaign,' Farage wrote on this Twitter. Earlier he said he would accept a job from Donald Trump if the latter became president.
HUNGARY 
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban responded to Trump's victory with the words 'what a great news. Democracy is still alive,' posted on his Facebook page.
AUSTRIA 
Austria will remain a 'bridge builder' between the East and West and is ready to cooperate with any head of state chosen by the American people, Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said.
'We are a 'bridge builder' and the country in which both the East and the West are well represented. We will continue with this course. We will accept any result of the election and will continue to strive for joint work with the United States,' Kurtz said on radio OE1, as cited by RIA Novosti news agency. He also compared the results of the US election with the Brexit vote.
Austria's far-right Freedom Party (FPO) leader Heinz-Christian Strache said Trump's victory in the election is the righteous punishment for the corrupt establishment.
'The political left as well as the aloof and sleazy establishment are being punished by voters and voted out of various decision-making positions,' Strache said on Facebook. His party is hopeful its own anti-immigrant and EU-critical candidate Norbert Hofer will become the European Union's first far-right head of state on December 4.
PALESTINE 
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement that he 'congratulates the elected American president, Donald Trump, and hopes that peace will be achieved during his term,' as cited by AP.
INDIA 
Indian Prime Minister Narenda Modi also congratulated Trump, tweeting he is 'looking forward to working with [Trump] closely to take India-US bilateral ties to a new height.'
AUSTRALIA 
Australia's foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said her government is ready to work with 'whomever the American people in their wisdom choose to be their president.' She noted that the US administration 'will have a number of challenges, particularly in our region, and we want to work constructively with the new administration to ensure the continued presence and leadership of the United States in our region.'
SOUTH KOREA 
One of America's top allies in the Pacific, South Korea, said that they would expect the US to go on with the policy of pressuring North Korea.

Rep. Paul Ryan must step down as Speaker of the House.
America rejected his big government, open borders globalism.
Paul Ryan rejected Trump all year long.
And now the majority are calling on Wisconsin lawmaker to step down.
Americans deserve a Republican Speaker who will support President Trump. A bridge, not a wall.
Sean Hannity spoke tonight on FOX after Donald Trump won the election for President of the United States. He noted that he spoke with Trump three times throughout the night after he said the following:
And on every objective measure, you know thank God the American people this is about one thing. They see that Washington is broken and by the way Republicans are just as guilty. Paul Ryan is not going to be the Speaker off the House in January. I was going to save that for my program tomorrow. He's not going to be the Speaker. His state went for Donald Trump tonight.
I mean it's an amazing turn of events because the establishment on both sides Republican and Democrat have lost touch with the real lives of real Americans that are really suffering and Donald Trump has now opened the door and said we're going to fix it and we're going to turn that table over and you know what, I wish him all the best cause it's not going to be easy because it's all the same people that opposed him in the lead up to tonight are going to be opposing him tomorrow.

The Liberal media just can't give Trump his due after his historic win yesterday. Still today at 3:30pm 'ì nearly 24 hours since voting stopped 'ì the liberal media will not show Trump's total winning results.
The New York Times which did a respectable job last night keeping with timely updates still does not show Trump wins in Michigan or Arizona. Yet they report Michigan with 100% reporting with Trump up 48% to Clinton's 47%.
Arizona is worse. They show Trump leading in Arizona by five points with 100% reporting (50% to 45%).
Trump also nearly won Minnesota and New Hampshire which he lost only by 1437 votes.
Real Clear Politics is still showing Trump with only 225 delegates to date, under reporting his 300+ delegates materially.

All other electoral maps are showing Donald Trump stuck at 279 as we speak. They will eventually update but this is going on for hours now. They are so humiliated and filled with hatred against Trump that they simply delay updating their maps.
The count is over and the only one showing the finalized updated map at this point is Wikipedia which shows 306 electors.
Just a few days ago the media was having wet dreams about a Hillary Clinton landslide. They were fantasizing about Hillary getting 352 electoral votes . What a bunch of pathetic scumbags. Cancel your subscription to them, subscribe to us instead. The EU Times, we have openly supported Donald Trump since he first announced in June 2015! When everybody else was bashing him back in the primaries over bimbo Megyn Kelly, over low-energy Jeb! we were among the few who were bashing left and right everywhere to defend our dear leader of whom we immediately fell in love with just because of his immigration program alone and then more goodies were added to the table as time went on, trade deals, NAFTA, TPP, returning of jobs, industry from China, Mexico, etc. Check our archives, read our older stories, convince yourself that we are 100% Trump authentic and Trump supporters since day 1!

CNN , Washington Post , New York Times , NBC News , Google , absolutely NO ONE has updated their maps to include Michigan and Arizona! Well at least it looks like CNN finally awarded Arizona to Trump which now stands at 290 electors but they are refusing to grant him Michigan despite finishing the count hours BEFORE Arizona. They simply can't believe that so many blue northern states went to Trump'¶
It is official, it wasn't just a victory, it was a LANDSLIDE VICTORY, the people have spoken!

It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s easy to glance at Tuesday√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s popular vote √¢‚Ç¨' which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012 √¢‚Ç¨' and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated.
While she underperformed relative to Obama√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 2012 totals in several Midwestern states √¢‚Ç¨' Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin √¢‚Ç¨' Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s more, she far surpassed Obama√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 2012 vote total in Florida, the country√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it.
Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. A review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college.
The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nation√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s most critical battleground states.
Let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t yet final because not all precincts have reported.
FLORIDA √¢‚Ç¨' 29 EVs √¢‚Ç¨' 98 percent reporting 
Obama 2012: 4,235,270
Clinton 2016: 4,485,745
Romney 2012: 4,162,081
Trump 2016: 4,605,515
Conclusion: Trump beats Obama by some 370,000 votes and wins Florida. (Note: Clinton herself won 250,000 more votes in Florida than Obama did in 2012.)
PENNSYLVANIA √¢‚Ç¨' 20 EVs √¢‚Ç¨' 97 percent reporting 
Obama 2012: 2,907,448
Clinton 2016: 2,844,705
Romney 2012: 2,619,583
Trump 2016: 2,912,941
Conclusion: Trump squeezes past Obama by a margin of some 5,000 votes and wins Pennsylvania. (Note: Clinton runs about 60,000 votes behind Obama, but would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had more than enough to defeat Romney in 2012.)
OHIO √¢‚Ç¨' 18 EVs √¢‚Ç¨' 94 percent reporting 
Obama 2012: 2,697,260
Clinton 2016: 2,317,001
Romney 2012: 2,593,779
Trump 2016: 2,771,984
Conclusion: Trump edges Obama by roughly 75,000 votes and wins Ohio. (Note: Clinton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worst battleground state showing was Ohio, winning 380,000 [!] fewer votes than Obama.)
Stop right there and crunch the numbers: Florida (29) + Pennsylvania (20) + Ohio (18) = 67 EVs.
Romney finished with 206 EVs. By protecting all of those, and then taking 67 from Obama, Trump would hit 273 and win the presidency.
The question: Did Trump 2016 defeat Obama 2012 in all of the states Romney won? Yes. Here√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a look at the competitive ones:
√¢‚Ç¨' NORTH CAROLINA (98 percent reporting): Trump 2,339,603 √¢‚Ç¨≈ö Obama 2,178,388
√¢‚Ç¨' ARIZONA (73 percent reporting): Trump 947,284 √¢‚Ç¨≈ö Obama 930,669
√¢‚Ç¨' GEORGIA (93 percent reporting): Trump 2,068,623 √¢‚Ç¨≈ö Obama 1,761,761
√¢‚Ç¨' UTAH (78 percent reporting): Trump 360,634 √¢‚Ç¨≈ö Obama 229,463
A review of the Romney 2012 states confirms that Trump, in this hypothetical matchup, would have carried every single one against Obama.
It doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter that Obama would have trounced Trump by nearly 300,000 votes in Michigan; by more than 200,000 in Wisconsin; by 175,000 in Virginia; and by 160,000 in Colorado. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s similarly meaningless that Obama would have narrowly defeated Trump in Iowa, Nevada, and New Hampshire. The 44th president carried all of those states in 2012, and in this hypothetical contest, he would successfully defend all of them. But it wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be enough.
The electoral college would produce a razor-thin margin: Trump 273, Obama 265.
Again, this is an apples-to-oranges exercise. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s impossible to know how the Obama campaign might have targeted certain voters in a contest against Trump, or whether Trump would have the same success in the three big battleground states against a more formidable opponent. But that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not the point here; the point is that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not entirely fair to blame Clinton for depressing Democratic turnout when she ran even with him in five of the country√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s most competitive states and ahead of him in a sixth, Florida, the single biggest swing state √¢‚Ç¨' and still lost the electoral college.

A grim new Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that intelligence analysts of the System of Forward-looking Military Research and Development ( SFLMRD ) have now placed the United States in the ' active zone ' of nations currently undergoing a ' Colour Revolution ' as both US and EU elites have united to topple the soon to come government of President-elect Donald Trump. [ Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, SFLMRD intelligence analysts are tasked with using ' modern/sophisticated ' technologies to ensure and protect the Federation's national security interests'îand of which the MoD has previously identified ' Colour Revolutions ' as being one of the gravest threats, not only to Russia, but the entire world.
During the MoD's 2014 meeting of the Moscow Conference on International Security , this report explains, Federation military commanders labeled ' Colour Revolutions ' as a new US and European approach to warfare that focuses on creating destabilizing revolutions in other nations as a means of serving their security interests at low cost and with minimal casualties .
The some of first of these Western ' Colour Revolutions ' to be unleashed on an unsuspecting world, this report continues, was in 2003 when the legitimately elected democratic government of Georgia was overthrown in what was called the ' Rose Revolution ''îand that turned this once peaceful nation into a Western military puppet who, in 2008, launched an unprovoked attack against the Federation , but that was quickly and decisively defeated.
Next to be attacked by a Western ' Colour Revolution ', this report notes, was Ukraine, in 2004, who's ' Orange Revolution ' resulted in the 2014 overthrow of that nations legitimately elected government in what the powerful American private intelligence agency Stratfor (aka The Shadow CIA ) called ' the most blatant coup in history ''îand like Georgia before it, has, likewise, been used by the West as a military puppet against the Federation .
In 2005, this report continues, the West then launched a ' Colour Revolution ' against Kyrgyzstan called the ' Tulip Revolution ''îbut that ultimately failed leading that nation, in 2014, to expel the US military from its territory .
Once the subversive tactics of the West in their using their ' Colour Revolutions ' against other nations was ' deciphered/discovered ', this report says, both Iran (2009-' Green Revolution ') and Russia (2011-' White (Snow) Revolution ') were able to be stop them from being successful and causing great loss of life.
To exactly how the West ' engineered/manipulated ' their ' Colour Revolutions ', this report explains, was through the use of what are called non-governmental organizations ( NGO's ) using very innocuous sounding names that the United States and European Union would secretly funnel millions-of-dollars into for the purpose of fermenting rebellion'îand which, in 2015, President Putin signed a law against preventing their nefarious actions in the Federation .
Heading nearly all of these Western backed and financed ' Colour Revolution ' NGO's, this report details, is the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros 'îwho has not only fomented rebellions across the world costing thousands of innocent lives, he was, also, recently exposed as being Hillary Clinton's puppetmaster controlling all of her actions during her failed bid to become the US president .
Unlike the Federation that has protected itself against a George Soros led, and US-EU funded, NGO ' Colour Revolution ', this report grimly warns, the United States government has now become the most vulnerable nation in the world to this type of ' rebellion/warfare ' as he funds hundreds of organizations violently opposed to both America and that nations core moral values .
And immediately upon Donald Trump being elected as the 45 th President of the United States, this report states, these George Soros funded NGO's launched their newest ' Colour Revolution ' intended not only to destroy President Trump, but the entirety of America.
Led by the George Soros funded MoveOn.org NGO , this report continues, this new ' Colour Revolution ' striking American began with tens-of-thousands of protesters striking nearly all of the United States largest cities 'îand that was quickly followed with thousands of these revolutionaries calling for the assassination of President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence before they can take office .
To the main ' purpose/reason ' behind these protests, this report explains, is to initiate a ' brutal/violent ' response from US government forces seeking to suppress them and reestablish order'îwhich in turn these revolutionaries will use as an example of how the American government is no longer legitimate because it's killing innocent people, and, therefore, must be overthrown.
Not being understood by the American people about how these ' Colour Revolutions ' work, this report continues, is that they are intended to last for years'îlike in Ukraine that took a full 10 years before that government was overthrown.
To the most basic reason why this ' Colour Revolution ' is now targeting the United States, this report details, are the US-EU elites fear of President-elect Donald Trump whose choice of nationalism over globalism has left European leftist leaders in ' complete horror ' as the populace revolution he, Trump, is leading is soon to wash ashore in Europe as new elections for nearly all of the continent are nearing'îwith Holland being the first fall , and France soon to follow , and whose next leader, Marine Le Pen , just proclaimed: ' Congratulations to the new President of the US, Donald Trump, and the American people 'ì free! '
With the US propaganda mainstream media still in denial of what has happened to them because of President-elect Donald Trump's victory, and Google now reporting that their top search term is ' How did Donald Trump win? ' , this report further states, it bears notice that the Kremlin and its intelligence analysts were among the only entities in the world who correctly stated Donald Trump would win'îand as we had detailed in numerous reports, including Russia Confirms Supercomputer Findings Showing Donald Trump Landslide Victory and Russian Report Warns: American Revolution Has Now Begun, May Last Entire Decade .
But to the most global consequential outcome of Donald Trump becoming the 45 th President of the United States, this report concludes, (and as we had previously alerted you to on 13 May in our report Putin Warns Military Commanders: 'If It's Hillary Clinton, It's War' ) was President Putin's advisor Sergei Glaziev stating just hours ago how close to catastrophe our world actually was: ' Americans had two choices: World War III or multilateral peace. Clinton was a symbol of war, and Trump has a chance to change this course .'
Let's all hope President Trump can, indeed, change this course because the world, literally, now hangs in the balance if he doesn't.

'First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win!' Mahatma Gandhi, India's legendary activist. It is now time for a NEW New World Order! A patriotic and conservative world order because we had enough of what we already experienced for years!
One of the most confounding aspects of Donald Trump's election as 45th President of the United States is that in the space of a year 'ì indeed less than a year 'ì a man with zero political experience has destroyed two of the most entrenched political dynasties: Bush and Clinton.
Just pause on this for a moment, and place it in the context of someone who in response to his appearance on the political stage as a candidate for the Republican nomination was met with ridicule and scorn. Consequently, a mainstream media and liberal commentators for whom politics is an exclusive club, the preserve of a select group of blessed people who belong to the club as if by divine right, have just been delivered one almighty slap-down The sense of entitlement that emanated from the Clinton campaign during this election was astonishing to behold. Hillary Clinton emitted the demeanour of a woman approaching a coronation rather than an election, disdaining not only on Donald Trump but also his supporters, whom she infamously described as 'deplorables'. This was her undoing.
One of the most salient consequences of the 2008 global economic crash, which ushered in the worst crisis within capitalism since the 1930s, has been the collapse of the political center ground and with it the dominance of the liberal order.
In this respect, it is just as Karl Marx opined in his Communist Manifesto:
'All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life√¢‚Ç¨≈ö'
The analogy that best describes this process is a battlefield after the smoke has cleared to reveal the ideological right on one side and its left wing counterpart on the other, ready to go to war over the right to shape the future. And as Brexit in the UK and now Trump's electoral victory in the US leaves no doubt, this is a struggle currently being won by the right.
This is not to suggest the struggle is completely over however. On the contrary, the political, social, economic and constitutional crisis ushered in by Brexit proves that there remains some distance to travel before the matter is settled in Britain, while Trump's election will inevitably give rise to strong opposition in the streets, perhaps even sparking a much needed revival of the left across the US, which based on the success of the Sanders campaign is far from dead.
Focusing in on Donald Trump and based on statements he made in the course of his campaign, it is interesting to observe that among the many places where you will find the most grievously disappointed people in response to his victory, are NATO headquarters in Brussels and Daesh (also known as ISIL/ISIS) and Nusra headquarters in Syria. It is evidence of the hitherto insurmountable contradiction that has lain at the heart of Washington's geopolitical priorities and strategy these past few years. Trump, in contrast, laid it out very simply when he said, 'Russia is killing ISIS. Assad is killing ISIS. I think it would be a good idea to get along with Russia.'
This being said, the acid test is what he does rather than what he has said, which is why it remains far too soon to be complacent in welcoming a new dawn in Washington's relations with Russia or the rest of the world. Trump also said some harsh things about China and Iran during his election campaign, which taken in conjunction with the fact that as president he immediately becomes the CEO of an empire that is no longer sustainable, requires us to exercise caution rather than celebration at this stage.

Shocking video out of Chicago shows a mob of young black men viciously beating an older white man because he voted for Donald Trump, dragging him through the streets as he hangs out of the back of his car.
The clip shows the thugs repeatedly screaming, 'you voted Donald Trump' as they assault the victim from every angle while others steal his belongings.
'You voted Trump,' the mob screams, 'You gonna pay for that sh*t.'
Another woman shouts 'beat his ass,' while another man is heard laughing before remarking, 'Don't vote Trump.'
A second video of the incident which is dubbed with the 'F**k Donald Trump' song, a phrase now being chanted by 'protesters' across the country, shows one of the attackers driving away in the man's vehicle while his hand is still stuck in the window as the car drags him down the street.
'The scene is frankly reminiscent of a lynching,' remarks Chris Menahan .
It is not even clear if the victim was a Trump supporter. Presumably, the mob used that as an excuse to beat and rob him.
YouTube quickly deleted the video, but it has been mirrored on numerous different websites.
If the roles had been reversed, and Trump supporters had been caught on tape viciously beating a black Hillary voter, this would be a national news story right now.
This is simply unacceptable 
As it is, you won't see this on CNN any time soon. Perhaps blacks should also be deported to Africa'¶ they never seem to be satisfied, no one ever seems to make them happy. They even rioted and protested during Obama, with one of their own as president. Black Lives Matter was formed during Obama.
Besides maybe us whites are bad with them and misbehave with them, sometimes willingly and purposefully while other times by mistake. So it would be best if we separate so that we don't have these ancient conflicts anymore. This man who was beaten so badly never did anything wrong to these people, neither willingly nor unwillingly but these conflicts still happen because we are not compatible with each other.
After all first Republican president Abraham Lincoln believed in separation , he freed them from slavery but he also said:
I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in anyway the social and political equality of the white and black races 'ì that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything.
Now we do disagree with Lincoln's idea of superior-inferior relationship. It would however be best to separate though. It just doesn't work. Despite having almost 2 centuries now since the Emancipation Proclamation, conflicts still run rampant and no real friendship has ever been established. They should be resettled perhaps to Liberia, a plan supported by Abraham Lincoln and be helped financially with billions or even trillions of dollars until they can start their own economy and industry. They do deserve that. Anyone intermarried with them should be free to either stay in the US and divorce or simply go along with their families.

The Obamas refused to be photographed welcoming President-Elect Donald Trump and his wife Melania to the White House Thursday morning, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal .
'The Obamas canceled a photo-op of the current and future first couples outside the south entrance of the White House. In his first visit to the White House after the 2008 election, Mr. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama posed for the cameras alongside President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush. The decision not to participate in this tradition illustrates how bitter the campaign was, particularly for Mrs. Obama who delivered some of the most emotional arguments against electing Mr. Trump.'
Fox News reported that there was no pool video of Trump's arrival due to an unspecified problem. There does not appear to be any photographs published yet of Trump's arrival to the White House.

President George W. Bush and Mrs. Laura Bush and President-elect Barack Obama and Mrs. Michelle Obama pause for photographs Monday, Nov. 10, 2008, after the Obama's arrival at the South Portico of the White House.

US President Barack Obama has said that the United States should be the country to win a new global health race and find a cure for cancer 'once and for all.' 
'Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer,' Obama said during his final State of the Union address on Tuesday, referencing Joe Biden's remarks last year when he announced not to run for president. 
'Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources they've had in over a decade,' he added. 
'Tonight, I'm announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he's gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I'm putting Joe in charge of Mission Control. For the loved ones we've all lost, for the family we can still save, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all,' Obama stated. 
Biden launched a high-profile push last year to find a cure for cancer, which kills millions of people around the world every year, after his oldest son, Beau, died from brain cancer in May. 
In October, Biden announced that he would not enter the US presidential race, saying after the death of his son he lacks the emotional energy required to put up a good fight against Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. 
Biden's wife, Jill, said she was disappointed her husband decided not to seek the Democratic nomination. 'I believed he would've been the best president,' she said. 
In his comments on Tuesday night, Biden said his priority will be increasing public and private funds to fight cancer. 
'The federal government will do everything it possibly can'ä'î through funding, targeted incentives, and increased private-sector coordination'ä'î to support research and enable progress,' Biden wrote in a blog post. 
Biden compared the commitment to fighting cancer to President John F. Kennedy's dedication to send American scientists to the moon more than five decades ago: 'This is our moonshot.'

Illegals waving Mexican flags, blacks, communists, white social justice warriors burning American flags, gays, transgenders and basically all degenerated freaks of nature united in violent riots across the US, shouting and tweeting assassinate Trump chants. The photos and videos you are about to see should make your stomach turn upside-down. After you finish reading, scroll down and watch.
As an advice, avoid provoking these wild beasts unless you want to get beaten down badly, hospitalized or even killed, if they ask you who you voted for, lie to them, tell them Hillary Clinton, Gary Johnson or Jill Stein. We have seen countless aggravated assaults and even down-right murders in the last days against patriotic Americans who voted for Donald Trump. Do NOT engage these wild beasts no matter how much sorrow you may feel in your heart when you see different kind of scenes, such as burning of the US flag, torching stores, cars, chanting hate, etc. Let them go wild and do what they do until January 20th. After that, the law will crack down on them like you never seen before.
The American people have swallowed enough, soon retribution will come and millions upon millions will finally get deported and arrested. These people need to be punished. California in particular is worst. The millions of Mexicans who invaded California are now calling for 'Calexit'. Sure after illegally invading that state, they now call for it to secede so they can later unite it with Mexico. These people must think the Americans are stupid. Getting their hands on Silicon Valley and Hollywood for free? IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN MEXICANS! According to Wikipedia, there are only 38% whites living in California as of 2015 after decades of ongoing invasion. Due to the that the state is permanently locked as a blue Democrat state. Republicans can sit on their tongues and eat their own eyeballs and that state will never go red in the current condition it is. This makes the road for Republicans extremely difficult since California holds the larges number of electors, 55. Non-Hispanic whites decreased from about 76.3 'ì 78% of the state's population in 1970 to 38.0% in 2015 making them a minority in their own country. Its not like they committed suicide, they are still there but the number of migrants surpassed them, making them a minority now.
According to a census from 2010 when California had 37.2 million population in total (in 2015 it had 39.1 million) only 15.7 are white and 2.6 mil black. The rest is South American, mostly illegals. Those who are legal, are illegally legal if you understand what we mean. They've got their citizenship through Obama's amnesties. These people will always vote Democrat, riot and demand free stuff. They need to be deported immediately or America will lose California forever which would be a shame! America must not allow Calexist. Imagine losing Hollywood and Silicon Valley! You can't just immigrate to a foreign nation, then demand secession, then later demand unification with your country of origin.
You think this is a joke? Have a look! The media is telling you however that 'Americans are calling to secession'. No! These are South American invaders, mostly Mexicans! They need to get deported, all of them! Both LEGAL and ILLEGAL because most 'legals' obtained their citizenship illegally.

So who is fomenting this? Go to minute 1:33

We know for a fact that most of these riots are planned and paid for by globalist billionaire George Soros. He too needs to be arrested along with his entire family and have his entire fortune seized and nationalized into the US federal budget. America could use his money, after all its dead broke! The bastard is already old, 83 years old to be exact and he may not live for much longer but still he should face justice for all the riots, calls to assassinations and violence he is provoking.
See these buses? They brought thousands of protesters to Austin, Texas! Yes, the riots are ORGANIZED, PAID, SPONSORED, etc. George Soros and his entire family needs to be locked up.



They are even running ads on Craigslist searching for more rioters:

Whites who are doing this are suffering from what is known as the Stockholm Syndrome . They do not even realize what they are doing.
These people look like they are straight from Noah's times, when God flooded the Earth because he had enough:


Man attacked for voting for Trump'¶








Cher! Didn't this harlot said that she will leave America if Trump is elected? Now she's pushing for riots and violence?






Look at this sorry retard! She got more votes? So what? He got more electors! Besides she got millions of ILLEGAL votes from illegal border crossers which shouldn't even be allowed to vote.

Confront whiteness? What if someone would say confronting blackness? Hmm? What about confronting Jewishness? Ahh yeah: dats rayyysist!
And we thought Jews were our friends'¶ perhaps we were wrong!
Look at how this moronic liberal mother is installing fear into this poor child! I bet she told her something similar to this: 'There's a big fat blonde boogieman living in the tower of Sauron, and we here are the warriors of God, we have been sent by Jesus himself to purify America, we need to kill him because he wants to kill us all.' Where's CPS when you need them?


Look at the guts these Mexicans have! Instead of laying low and pretending like they are not even there, look at what they are doing. It's like basically: look at how disgusting, disturbing and violent I am, don't you wanna deport me?






To the woman in the left, yes Trump is NOT your president. Pena Nieto is, go back to Mexico.
If you're Chinese and refuse to acknowledge Trump as your president then go back to your Communist president Xi Kingpin.


Perhaps these Socialists should move to Venezuela or North Korea.



Sure they do! In Mexico! :)
No granny, he's not YOUR president, but who cares? Hillary wouldn't have been other people's president. Trump won despite having your evil which stealing millions of votes. Don't like it? Pack your bags and get out! It's time to clean America! Venezuela and Cuba would suit your better, they have multicultural socialist hellholes. Just the way you like it!
The electoral college is part of the Constitution but who cares? Viva la Che Guevara Chaos and communism, hammer and sickle!

Muh feelings! What a disturbing feminazi character'¶ who would date this creature?
Indeed, he's not your president, Pena Nieto is, go embrace him!

Ruling coalition lawmakers stand to approve the passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade deal in the lower house of the parliament in Tokyo on November 10, 2016.
Japan's Lower House of parliament has passed the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement, despite the fact the deal is likely doomed after Donald Trump's US presidential election victory. Even Barack Obama gave up on TPP according to The Wall Street Journal.
The ruling coalition of the Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito backed the agreement, while most of the opposition boycotted the vote.The bill was sent to the Upper House for final approval, with the ruling coalition expecting it to be signed into law by November 30.
TPP has been one of the key points in the economic program of Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, who wanted to boost the country's exports. However, experts view the TPP approval by Japan as a more of symbolic gesture, as the deal is unlikely to ever get a green light under Trump.
During the campaign, the newly-elected president slammed the TPP, which was pushed forward by Barack Obama to limit China's economic power, calling the agreement a 'disaster.'
TPP was 'dead and buried,' Marcel Thieliant, Japan Economist from Capital Economics, told Deutsche Welle, adding that 'the upshot is that the long-term losses for Japan from the TPP not coming into force are substantial.'
A former Chinese diplomat, now with the China Institute of International Studies, suggested that the TPP would be the 'first casualty' of Trump's success.'Since China isn't in that bloc, we don't have anything to lose,' Ruan is cited by Reuters as saying.
The demise of the TPP prompted Beijing to intensify efforts to achieving its own free trade deal in the Asia-Pacific. China's Vice Foreign Minister, Li Baodong, said that the country will be looking for support of its initiatives at the Asia-Pacific regional summit in Peru on November 19-20.
'Trade and investment protectionism is rearing its head, and Asia-Pacific faces insufficient momentum for internal growth, and difficulties in advancing reforms,' Li told journalists.
'China believes we should set a new and very practical working plan, to positively respond to the expectations of industry, and sustain momentum and establish a free trade area in Asia-Pacific at an early date,' he added.
Beijing proposed the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to regulate free trade in the area.
According to Li, the presence of Chinese President Xi Jinping in Peru confirmed Beijing's 'confidence in promoting the FTAAP process.' Previously, Beijing was concerned the TPP would be used by Washington to make China open it's markets by becoming part to the agreement or isolating the country from other economies in the region.
Obama had framed TPP, which excluded China, as an effort to write Asia's trade rules before Beijing could, establishing US economic leadership in the region as part of his 'pivot to Asia'.
Besides the US and Japan the TTP deal included Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.
The agreement was part of Washington's 'pivot to Asia,' with Obama hoping it would establish US economic leadership in the region by formulating Asia-Pacific trade rules before Beijing does it.

Elly Warren, from Melbourne, was travelling Africa before she tragically died on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old woman who was travelling in Africa was last seen dropping off her bag at a beachside hostel before being found dead in a toilet cubicle.
Elly Warren, from Melbourne, was expected to return to Australia on Monday before heading to New Zealand with her boyfriend for a holiday.
Days before she set off for Africa, the 20-year-old told her father: 'It's dangerous Dad, I don't know if I should be going over there.'
And things took a turn for the worst after she was raped and attacked when she reportedly walked home alone from a party in Mozambique on Wednesday.
The young traveller had booked two nights at the beachfront Wuyani Pariango backpackers in the picturesque Tofo Bay but she failed to return to her room.
Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, the hostel manager, who wished to remain anonymous, said staff members had seen the woman before she went missing.
'She came in alone to drop off her bag and then left to meet a friend,' the hostel manager revealed.
'She had pre-booked her accommodation but never stayed here.'
The 20-year-old had been holidaying and doing a volunteer stint in Mozambique.
The young woman had booked two nights at the Wuyani Pariango backpackers in Tofo Bay.
Daily Mail Australia understands Ms Warren's body is currently being transported from Tofo Beach to the country's capital Maputo, some 500 kilometres away where a post-mortem will be performed.
Paul Warren, the distraught father of the avid traveller, is currently travelling to Mozambique in an effort to bring his daughter's body home.
On Thursday he revealed his heartbreak over his daughter's terrible death.
A tearful Mr Warren told 7News: 'She even told me, 'It's dangerous dad, I don't know if I should be going over there'.
'And I said to her: 'Yes it is, very dangerous'.'
On Thursday evening, hours after paying a moving Facebook tribute to his daughter, Mr Warren also revealed on social media an autopsy would be conducted to determine her cause of death.
'I would just like everyone to pray for our Elly right now,' he wrote on Facebook.
'She is at peace with Sam, our dog, who she grew up with and loved dearly. Thank you all for your thoughts and well wishes Elly touched us all in some special way.
'The funeral is going to take some time as Elly was in a remote fishing village called Pemba.
'There is going to be an investigation and autopsy, which I have been informed can take up to two weeks.
'I will be going over there in a few day to bring my baby back home. God bless you Elly Rose Warren.'
The hostel manager said staff saw Ms Warren drop her bag off before heading out to see a friend but she failed to return to her room (pictured is one of the rooms at the hostel)
The young traveller had booked two nights at the Wuyani Pariango backpackers in Tofo Bay.
Staff members at the hostel claimed they saw Ms Warren drop her bag off before heading back out to meet a friend.
Her family, who found out about the young traveller's death in a heartbreaking late-night phone call from another backpacker, believe she became separated from her group before her body was later found in a toilet cubicle, The Age reported.
The revelation comes after her sister Kristy Warren took to Facebook to warn backpackers to be 'careful who they go [travelling] with'.
'My sister was in Africa whilst my mum got a phone call from one of the backpackers saying to her that her daughter has been murdered,' Ms Warren posted to Facebook.
'As I heard that my heart dropped. It is a parent's nightmare to get a phone call like this.'
Describing her sister as 'maybe too ambitious', she urged travellers to be vigilant when overseas.
'I want to say if you are thinking of going travelling or going overseas please be careful who you go with,' she wrote.
Ms Warren had been in the country since late September as part of Underwater Africa, a conservation program that 'helps protect the oceans'.
The volunteer tour's booking manager Graeme Warrack told Daily Mail Australia the young traveller had left their group the day before she was killed.
A room at the backpackers Ms Warren was last seen before her death.
Ms Warren (pictured) has been killed while on a volunteer holiday to Mozambique, Africa.
The 20-year-old from Mordialloc, in Melbourne's south-east suburbs, was also reportedly sexually assaulted before her death.
'Elly arrived with us on the 27th of September and left our program on the November 8,' he said.
'We dropped her at her new accommodation at 5pm, to hear the news the next day has left us as broken as anyone can be, she was our friend and colleague.
'We're trying to find out where exactly she went once she left us, that's something we can't answer.'
Mr Warrack described Ms Warren as 'the life of the party' and said her death had taken a large toll on her fellow volunteers and scientists.
'Elly was an incredible volunteer who was doubtlessly the life and soul of any activity,' he said.
Ms Warren's mother, Nicole Cafarella told The Age her daughter was 'just one of those girls that wanted to travel the world and see everything she could before she was 30'.
Just days earlier Ms Warren had posted a video to Facebook of herself swimming with whale sharks off the Mozambique coast.
