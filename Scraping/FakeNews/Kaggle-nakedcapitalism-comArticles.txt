CETA: ''I trust that an agreement will be reached in the course of today with Belgium, Wallonia and other parts of the country,' Mr Juncker told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France' [ Business Times ]. 'Some two hours of Belgium negotiations broke up without an apparent agreement early Wednesday, following six hours of similar talks the previous evening.' Reading all the Eurocrat statements, it looks to me like 'an' agreement, to Juncker, means an agreement to sign the agreement, CETA, at some future date (so that Thursday's summit with Justin Trudeau can proceed). 
CETA: 'What's Wallonia's deal? A primer on its role in CETA's crisis' [ Globe and Mail ]. ' [Walloon Premier Paul Magnette's] Socialist Party is under growing political pressure within Wallonia, an economically depressed rust-belt region. The Marxist party has been steadily gaining ground in recent polls, pushing the Socialists further to the left on issues such as trade.' There needs to be a left equivalent for 'Always Be Closing.' 
CETA: 'CETA has bigger problems than not-so-'tiny'-after-all Wallonia' [ Rabble. ca ]. '[B]y EU standards it is not all that small. Wallonia's population is 3.5 million, almost a third of the Belgian total of somewhat more than 11 million. There are seven EU countries with smaller populations. Each of the EU's 28 member states has veto power over CETA. That is how the EU works – on the Three Musketeers principle, one for all and all for one. If one or more of the smaller member states, such as Slovenia or Estonia, or one of the tiny island states with far fewer than a million people, Cyprus or Malta, vetoed the deal, would we be calling them tiny and insignificant?' 
CETA: 'Corporate Sovereignty Helps To Bring EU-Canada Trade Deal To Brink Of Collapse' [ TechDirt ]. This looks like what's on offer to Wallonia: 
The fact that CETA's ISDS/ICS remains the most problematic area can be seen from a fascinating CETA document (pdf) that was recently leaked. It's called the 'Joint Interpretative Declaration on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union and its Member States,' and is an attempt to offer additional guarantees that are enough to convince Magnette and other CETA skeptics to allow its signing and ratification: 
This interpretative declaration aims to provide a clear and unambiguous statement of what Canada and the European Union and its Member States agreed in a number of CETA provisions that have been the object of public debate and concerns. This includes, in particular, the impact of CETA on the ability of governments to regulate in the public interest, as well as the provisions on investment protection and dispute resolution, and on sustainable development, labour rights and environmental protection. 
The section on Investment Protection is by far the longest, reflecting the seriousness of the problems there. Here's a key paragraph: CETA clarifies that governments may change their laws, regardless of whether this may negatively affect an investment or investor's expectations of profits. Furthermore, CETA clarifies that any compensation due to an investor will be based on an objective determination by the Tribunal and will not be greater than the loss suffered by the investor. 
As that demonstrates, there is nothing new in the declaration. Nobody is claiming that CETA will stop governments changing their laws, just that the massive fines that can be imposed by supra-national tribunals are likely to discourage them from doing so. Similarly, claiming that those fines will be 'based on an objective determination by the Tribunal and will not be greater than the loss suffered by the investor' simply confirms the untrammelled power of the tribunal to impose whatever fine it thinks is appropriate. 
Lipstick on a pig. 
TPP: 'If the trade deal comes up during the lame-duck session this fall, the two [Vice Presidents] could play leading roles on opposite sides of the debate: Kaine as a potentially significant 'no' vote should the pact come up for a vote while he's still in the Senate, and Biden as President Barack Obama's go-to guy for shoring up Senate support and casting the tie-breaking vote if need be' [ Politico ]. 
TPP: 'The TPP 'provides no guarantee of equal rights and remedies to migrants for labor violations, no regional task force or other solution to address region-wide trafficking issue and no region-wide restrictions on abusive behaviors by recruiters who prey on desperate workers simply trying to feed their families,' Celeste Drake, the AFL-CIO's trade and globalization specialist, said during a call with reporters. While the broader deal does not contain migrant worker protections advocated by the labor group, Malaysia is obligated through a separate 'consistency plan' to undertake certain reforms for protecting migrant workers' [Politico]. Weak-ass framing from the AFL-CIO (no surprise here) and terrible reporting from Politico (ditto). The issue with Malaysia is not 'certain reforms to protect migrant workers,' and not even 'trafficking.' The issue is slavery , which Obama is enabling in order to get the deal passed. Use the word! 
TPP: 'Australia could face a growing number of expensive legal claims from foreign corporations if the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) comes into force, a new report has warned' [ Guardian ]. 'Dr Kyla Tienhaara, from the Australian National University, said Australia ought to learn from Canada's experience after it signed the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which came into force in 1994 and led to dozens of legal cases against Canada by US corporations [under ISDS].'

' But Trump's biggest local political donation [in Chicago] was the $50,000 he donated to Emanuel's first mayoral campaign' [ Chicago Reader (DG)]. 'That donation came on December 23, 2010, a couple months before Rahm was elected. In 2011, Emanuel's administration approved the god-awful 20-foot-high 'T-R-U-M-P' sign that the Donald felt compelled to plaster on his building overlooking the Chicago River. But Mayor Emanuel's not Trump's only Democratic pal in town. Trump also hired Alderman Burke's law firm to handle his tax appeals to Assessor Berrios's office. Burke then won Trump several million dollars worth of property tax breaks.' There don't seem to be many degrees of separation between the elites. I suppose that's why they're elites… 
Policy 
' A hotelier's guide to the 2016 presidential election' [ Hotel News Now ]. 'Many hotels in the U.S. rely on a flow of legal immigrants to fill a variety of positions. Hoteliers want that pipeline of potential employees to remain open, while avoiding additional red tape to verify their statuses.' 
'Battlegrounds: The Fight for Mosul and Election Day Disruptions' (podcast) [ Foreign Policy Editor's Roundtable ]. If you want to get a good reading on the insanity that is The Blob , this is the podcast for you. The speakers spend a good twenty minutes discussing the details of Syria and Iraq, concluding that historians will look back on it as 'a forty year's war,' without ever once giving a reason for us to be there . Soothing NPR voices, no anger, a lot of laughter. Smart people. 
War Drums 
'Hillary Clinton Promises A More Muscular Foreign Policy As President' [ HuffPo ]. 'As secretary of state, Clinton was an early supporter of arming and training members of the Syrian opposition to fight Assad, a plan that faced resistance out of concern that it would be difficult to appropriately vet fighters and ensure that weapons didn't fall into the hands of extremists. Today, the program is off to a slow start, with only 54 graduates from the first class, several of whom scattered after coming under attack by an al Qaeda affiliate in Syria. As commander-in-chief, Clinton would dramatically escalate the program, she said. ' Who was in charge of the training program? Ira Magaziner? 
The Voters 
'What Do Trump and Marx Have in Common?' [Jochen Bittner, New York Times ]. This is another piece along the lines of the article from the Manhattan Institute's City Journal that Yves linked to this morning, although it's not a piece of outright hackery. For example: 'When Hillary Clinton calls half of Mr. Trump's voters a 'basket of deplorables,' she sounds as aloof as Marie Antoinette, telling French subjects who had no bread to 'eat cake.'' But both articles deploy the 'angry populists of left and right' vs. the 'sensible center' trope (remember that in the Beltway you should never display anger; it's a strong taboo). Bittner concludes: 'Mrs. Clinton has the chance to change, by leading a political establishment that examines and processes anger instead of merely producing and dismissing it.' Obama destroyed hope by not delivering change. And now Clinton is holding the bag for the anger that caused. From the Department of Schadenfreude…

The Trail 
'But academic research has picked up something that thousands of hours of campaign punditry has missed completely: Donald Trump talks like a woman' [ Politico ]. 'Donald Trump is a stunning outlier. His linguistic style is startlingly feminine, so much so that the chasm between Trump and the next most feminine speaker, Ben Carson, is about as great as the difference between Carson and the least feminine candidate, Jim Webb. And Trump earns his ranking not just because he talks a lot about himself or avoids big words (both of which are true); according to Jones, he also shows feminine patterns on the more subtle measures, such as his use of prepositions and articles. The key then is not what Trump talks about—making Mexico pay for the wall or bombing the hell out of ISIL—but rather how he says it.' Readers?

Yves here. I strongly suspect that Naked Capitalism readers will find a lot not to love about this proposal, but I'll let you have at it in the comments section. I'll start with two. The first is setting up this program as bonds, when they are most like a trust account. And why should the amount of the grant be set at birth? A lot of children suffer severe setbacks after birth, like the death of a parent or debilitating injury. 
Second is that this proposal does nothing to address the expressed problem. The issue is that even though children from lower-income backgrounds might get into college, they can't mix much/at all socially with the better off students because they don't have the spending money to allow them to do that. But these 'bonds' provide for spending money only for perceived-to-be-legitimate purposes, like the education itself. Even though going on ski trips with the other kids might be key to economic advancement, it would be politically unacceptable for a government program to pay for that sort of thing. 
By Lynn Parramore, Senior Research Analyst at the Institute for New Economic Thinking. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website 
Imagine that a black child from a family of modest resources gets the opportunity to attend an elite college preparatory school. Motivated by a love of learning and strong desire to achieve, he excels in school and goes on to attend highly regarded universities, earning advanced degrees. Surely that child is well positioned to ascend the ladder of economic prosperity in America, right? 
Not so fast. 
The goal of broadening financial wealth to all Americans, regardless of race, gets plenty of applause across the political spectrum. But so far this goal has remained devilishly elusive. To understand why you have to know how people come by wealth in the first place. It's popular to say that we build wealth through discipline — by hitting the books, working hard and saving money. The reality is a little different. 
Past Injustice Shapes Present Reality 
Darrick Hamilton knows this from personal experience. Despite his family's modest means — not poor but hardly affluent — he attended the Brooklyn Friends School, an elite private institution where teachers emphasized social justice. Hamilton started college at Oberlin excited to seek out his path to the American Dream. But he soon found out that the path was smoother for some than for others. 
All around him, white kids from affluent families were getting checks in the mail from their parents — money that could be spent on tuition, extracurricular activities, and the kind of socializing that builds professional networks. Black students of more modest means, on the other hand, were often at a disadvantage even when their parents were able to help financially. If they received money from home, things besides books demanded financial attention. The same was true if they had a job. Even when black students worked hard and saved diligently, the money was often spoken for before it was time to pay the tuition bill for the semester. 
The reason has to do with the cumulative effects of centuries of gross economic disadvantages that black families have endured, from slavery to Jim Crow and beyond. The legacy of those severe headwinds is that even when an individual family is able to reach the middle class, there is still likely to be a constellation of poorer extended family members in need of various kinds of financial assistance. When they call, you help, if you can. Economists call this 'wealth leakage.' 
Hamilton noticed this phenomenon play out among black students at school and in the professional realm. Rather than enjoying resources from parents and grandparents, they often had to provide money for cousins, nieces, uncles, and siblings. After obtaining his Ph.D. in economics at UNC-Chapel Hill, Hamilton, who now teaches economics and urban policy at The New School in New York, focused on how poverty in the family increases the racial wealth gap for middle class black individuals. 
The source of wealth building in America, he realized, is less what you save than your capacity to invest in an asset through money given by parents and grandparents. These transfers are critical to the acquisition of assets, like a home or a small business — the kinds of things that require huge down payments. 
'If you're not fortunate enough to get that down payment or have that resource at a key juncture of your life,' observes Hamilton, 'you will not have that pathway towards building economic security that somebody else has. You could be a jerk. You could be a good person. It has little to do with the particular individual.' 
This logic flies in the face of the long-cherished belief that education and hard work are the great equalizers in American society. Many still insist that much present day inequality is caused by bad individual decisions and not by structural problems associated with discrimination. But the vast inequality between black and white citizens suggests that there's more going on than poor choices. In 2013, according to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, the median household wealth was $134,230 for whites compared to a paltry $11,030 for black Americans. 
The reason, says Hamilton, is pretty clear: 'In a capitalist system, if you lack capital, it just locks in inequality.' 
Fortunately, he thinks the problem can be alleviated if we are willing to aim the attack at the source. Hamilton and his colleague William A. Darity, Jr. of Duke University are stratification economists, pioneers in an emerging subfield of social science who focus on the structural dimensions of a person's economic position. They propose a solution to wealth inequality that may appeal across the political spectrum: Why not give every American baby seed capital so they can grow up to take part in the capitalist system? This could be done, they argue, through 'Baby Bonds' that would be set up for every child born. 
How Baby Bonds Work 
Baby Bonds, in Hamilton's formulation, would be funded directly out of Treasury and held in an account by the federal government, similar to Social Security. The amount a child receives would depend on the wealth position into which she is born. If she's the offspring of Oprah Winfrey and Bill Gates, she might get $500, but upwards of $50,000 if she is born at the lowest rungs of the economic ladder. The average amount for a child would be around $20,000. Accounts would be guaranteed a nominal one and a half rate of return, and the payout would not take place until the child becomes an adult. At that time, you get to spend the money — but not just on anything. The funds would have to be used for a 'clearly defined asset enhancing activity,' like financing a debt-free education, purchasing a business, or buying a home. (The program would need to be coupled with financial reform and regulation to mitigate predatory effects, including extraordinary tuition increases aimed at exploiting better-resourced young adult baby bond recipients). 
A commission would be set up to identify exactly what kinds of activities might qualify. 
'These conditions are set up to protect the resource,' says Hamilton. 'In my own situation, if I had received an infusion of cash as a young adult, there would have been a lot of family needs to take care of before I could begin thinking about self-investment like purchasing a home. Specifying what the money can be spent on may not guarantee an outcome, because people still choose the investment they engage in, but it at least ensures that the investment is an asset-enhancing endeavor which can help build wealth over the long run.' 
Unlike some past proposals for child savings accounts, Baby Bonds are designed so that it doesn't matter if your parents can contribute or not. Hamilton says this is done so that however good or bad or affluent or poor your parents may be, as a citizen you get some seed capital so that you can take part in the American economic mobility system. 
But wouldn't such a program be too costly? 
Not at all, says Hamilton. He notes that there are about 4 million children born every year, so if the average account is at $20,000, the whole program might cost $80 billion. If you add another $10 billion, the very highest estimate for administering the program, it comes to $90 billion maximum. That might sound like a lot, but not when you consider what the federal government already spends trying to promote asset ownership through the tax code. He cites a report on all such policies (like the mortgage interest reduction and reductions in capital gains) by CFED , a Washington-based non-profit focused on expanding economic opportunities for low-to-moderate income Americans. All told, these programs cost over $500 billion dollars . (The mortgage interest deduction alone is estimated to cost more than $405 billion for tax years 2014 through 2018 ). 
Next to these figures, Baby Bonds looks like a bargain. They also have the advantage of distributing the capital where it's needed most. Federal programs already in place tend to funnel money towards the more affluent, says Hamilton, noting that the bottom 60 percent of earners get about 5 percent of that $500 billion, while the top 10 percent get well over half. He thinks that Baby Bonds could be fully funded simply by capping the existing mortgage interest reductions. 
So how would a race-blind program help to close gaps in wealth and income between black and white Americans? 
Hamilton points out that about 85 percent of black households fall below the national median of the wealth distribution, so the means test for the Baby Bonds program as well as its target needs to be keenly focused on wealth. 
Baby Bonds address wealth in two ways: First, because of the way black people are clustered at the poorer end of the wealth distribution, more will qualify for the program. Secondly, because the program is focused on asset-enhancing activities, they will benefit when they become adults and are able to use the funds to build the kinds of assets that have so often been out of reach historically. 
A Potential Political Winner? 
Inequality has been a hot topic this political season, but much of the discussion has focused on student debt. Hamilton acknowledges that this is important, but it's not enough to close the racial wealth gap. 
'It will help avoid wealth leakage for millions of people and black individuals that end up going to college,' he says. 'It's certainly the case that black students are disproportionately impacted by student debt. But this only helps those who actually end up going to college. It's limited in its approach.' 
Something more is needed. He notes that in other countries, programs similar to Baby Bonds have already been implemented, such as a child trust program set up in 2005 that gave every British citizen born on or after September 1, 2002 an investment account to build savings that would help fund their transition to adult life. 
The U.K. program differed from Baby Bonds in several key ways: it was smaller in scale, parents could add to the account, and the trust was unconditional, meaning that the money could be used for anything rather than a specific set of potentially wealth-building activities. Unfortunately, the program sank under a wave of austerity in 2011 following the global recession, so it's unclear exactly how well it worked because the children who received the accounts are not yet old enough to have used them. 
Could Baby Bonds work in America? Hamilton observes that in the past, both conservatives and liberals have endorsed programs designed to give American children a stake in the future. KidSave, a program conceived by then-Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, with then-Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as co-sponsor, would have allotted each child a small deposit at birth (around $1000), with additional $500 deposits every year for five years. The money would then be invested in a limited number of mutual funds, but it couldn't be withdrawn until retirement, when a substantial nest egg would have theoretically grown. Various versions of the plan attracted support from conservatives like Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and the Heritage Foundation. 
The premise behind Baby Bonds is slightly different; it's based on the recognition that the problem in building wealth is not savings. 
'Most Americans don't save, period,' says Hamilton. 'It's really getting access to that asset that's going to appreciate. Homes give Americans most of their wealth, or, if not homes, some other asset. So this is moving us a bit from that narrative of how to leverage poor people to do better things by giving them incentives to saying, well, why don't we empower them with an account so that they actually can make decisions that can lead to their mobility.' 
Hamilton observes that Baby Bonds simply arm everybody with the opportunity to benefit from the markets— an idea the most die-hard free market champion might appreciate. 'If conservatives really believe in the fairness of the markets,' he says, 'then let's give everybody opportunity to participate. We're talking about babies, so this is before we start coming up with narratives about the deserving poor or the undeserving poor. We're saying, at birth, we're going to give everybody a chance to engage in economic mobility in America.' 0 0 0 0 0 0

Yves here. This Real News Network interview with Lawrence Wilkerson , not surprisingly, is pretty sobering. The rush transcript didn't have apostrophes, so I added them as best I could, but there are sure to be some spots I missed. 
SHARMINI PERIES, TRNN: Welcome to the Real News Network. I'm Sharmini Peries coming to you from Baltimore. 
The Obama administration is currently considering a proposal to send more arms to CIA backed anti Assad forces in Syria. According to the Washington Post, Obama has not made a decision yet and could leave it up to whoever wins the election in November. This of course raises questions of what would a President Hillary Clinton or President Donald Trump do in Syria? This has also been the topic at the presidential debates, recently. 
Joining us to discuss the Clinton's and Trump's approach as to foreign policy is Larry Wilkerson. Larry is a retired United States army soldier and former Chief of Staff to the United States Secretary of State Colin Powell. He's also just published an article in National Interest, written together with Gordon Adams about this topic. Larry thank you so much for joining us today. 
LARRY WILKERSON: Thanks for having me Sharmini. 
PERIES: So Larry in your recent piece titled No Hillary Clinton's Foreign Policy Judgment Isn't As Good As Everyone Says, you argued that a case for Clinton as a better foreign policy president on the basis on knowledge and experience. Now factoring all of this in, what's going on in Washington in terms of how they should behave or what foreign policy actions or military actions need to be taking place in Syria. How do you think Hillary Clinton would act? 
WILKERSON: I'm very concerned about it. I can tell you that right up front. Her posture with regard to Syria in general when she was secretary of state and some of the remarks shes made during the campaign, lead me to believe that she'll be very bellicose with regard to Syria. I hope I'm wrong. I hope a better judgement prevails. But as I said in the National Interest article, I,'m not all that convinced of it. That's based primarily on her track record with regard to Libya which is now a disaster, and it's my understanding that she was one of the if not the principle advocates of action in Libya when President Obama somewhat reluctantly decided to do it, following NATO into that country. And she was also an advocate of the war in Iraq and regime change there. So in those two instances, her judgement was flawed, seriously flawed you could argue, and based on her rhetoric with regards towards Syria, I certainly don't want to see that kind of judgement continued in that regard. 
PERIES: And in the recent debate, she was advocating a no fly zone over Syria. What does that mean and what implications will it have in terms of geopolitical allegiances at this time? 
WILKERSON: We're not dealing with a Libyan air force or an Iraqi air force or indeed a Syrian air force. What we're dealing with here is Russian air forces perhaps even as you and I were discussing eventually Chinese air forces, so they're not there now I don't think, and the Syrian air forces. So if we go in to establish a no fly zone and were serious about it, the first airplane that penetrates that zone is all important because youve just about got to shoot it down. If it's a Russian airplane, youre in trouble because youve now performed an act of war against Russia and Syria. What that means, well just have to wait and see but I don't think itll mean anything good for either side, or ultimately for Syria. 
So we're talking about if we lay down something like a no fly zone and say this is it as of midnight on such and such a time, no aircraft can fly through here. And suddenly 5 minutes later even, a Russian aircraft flies though, we have two choices. We shoot it down and risk war with Russia and that has all kinds of ramifications that are outside Syria as well as in Syria. Or we back off our claim and look like ineffectual boobs. I don't think either of those outcomes is conducive to US national security interests so I don't think we should go there in the first place. 
PERIES: Larry recently I did an interview with former CIA analyst, Ray McGovern and he said that President Putin in Russia, sees the next few months before potential Clinton presidency as a window of opportunity for consolidating Russia's position in the Ukraine and in Syria. Now many world leaders are predicting that a Clinton, as you have just done, will likely to escalate the situation particularly in Syria that this is an area that President Obama has been restrained with. Do you think that Ray is correct, that Putin consolidating his power and will Hillary Clinton in her assessment, go ahead on with Putin? 
WILKERSON: I'm concerned about it, as I said before because of her previous actions and because of some of the people she has advising her that look a lot like the people who were advising George W. Bush in his first administration from 2001-2005 of which I was a rather intimate member. So I am concerned about it. I hope that once she is in the Oval Office and if she indeed shes elected and she gets all the briefings and is brought up to speed and so forth. And she gets the council of her military leaders, she will be more circumspect and be more rational let us say than she is sometimes compelled to be on the political circuit and on the campaign trail. That's my hope. But as I said, based on her track record, I have some concern. Perhaps not as much as Ray but I still have some concern. 
PERIES: Now there's been a number of other defense analyst in recent years who argue that the president has relatively little room to maneuver because the intelligence community, the Defense Department and the State Department are the ones that really policy strategy. To what extent is that correct, science youve been at the center of all of this? 
WILKERSON: Defense Department does have an enormous amount of influence on the national security decision making process. There's no question about that. As do other nefarious influences like Lockheed-Martin, Halliburton and all the usual suspects weve heard about who influence congressional decision making and ultimately influence where the money goes and so forth. I think probably in this particular instance though with regard to Syria, what I'm hearing is the military and particularly the joint chiefs of staff are reluctant to enter this trade with potential for starting a shooting war with Russia. 
So I hope that what I'm hearing is correct and that they will act as a break on anything precipitant military action that secretary, then President Clinton or President Trump for that matter, would be willing or want to order. 
Let me just say that Trump has been all over the sheet of music if you will on this. But the remarks I have heard that resonate with me are those that would keep us out of these small wars on the periphery of empire if you will. They cost a fortune in blood and treasure and don't really promise to and rarely do solve anything. They certainly don't bring peace to instable regions and regions in conflict that Syria is today. They just make things worse. 
PERIES: Then finally Larry, when Hillary Clinton became the Secretary of State and then there was this very public pronouncement of resetting relations with Russia, what went wrong? Why are we where we are now where shes accusing the Russians of hacking into emails and as you know there's controversy over what she actually said in the debate in terms of the Russian involvement in all of this. Why is she escalating this and what went wrong with resetting the relations with Russia? 
WILKERSON: What went wrong with resetting the relationship was us. The US of A. We have wasted no opportunity to make Mr. Putin more powerful politically in his own country. As soon as he figured out that sticking his fingers in Washingtons eyes was a winning political formula, you could guarantee you were going to get more fingers in our eyes. More so than that, geopolitically and geostrategically, that is to say in the heart of Russia's near abroad we have been making moves from Ukraine to Georgia. And we have been making moves that anyone including myself, being the ruler of a country first erstwhile great power and seeing it happen would be responding to and responding to with the elements of national power which I have that can compensate for weakness that I have too. 
By that I mean Id be responding with everything from cyber warfare to little green men, to whatever I had that was competent and powerful in my arsenal that I felt like I could win with against the United States and ultimately against NATO. That's precisely what Putin has been doing. You could almost sit down and map it. Every time we make a mistake they capitalize on that mistake. I don't just mean mistakes as in execution or mistakes in being in somewhere where we shouldnt be at in a particular time. I mean policy mistakes. The policy mistake most glaringly pushing ourselves into Russia's near abroad and NATO along with us with ballistic missile defense, with exercises and so forth. 
If I were Putin I wouldve responded the same way. I think that Id have been just as smart as he has and Id capitalize on my streets against weaknesses and I wouldve gained the political capital that hes gained in the course of this time. It's not all totally our fault but a whole lot of it is. 
PERIES: So if we are collecting our thoughts here, Larry Russian, Chinese now, possibly Iranian collaboration over Syria are serious times. 
WILKERSON: And Russia exercising for the first time since the death of Anwar Sadat with the Egyptians. Russia selling major armaments to the Egyptians for the first time since I think about that same time period. The world is changing. Power is shifting and the United States needs not to be fearful of such changes but it needs to be a lot smarter of how it plays those changes to its own benefits. 
One of the things it needs to be most hard about is fear of deployments of its own military forces to get engaged in things like weve been engaged in for the past 20 years. Things like Afghanistan, things like Iraq, things like Syria and so forth. We really have no capability to influence these conflicts, these basically civil wars and so forth. Trying to do so from the opening as we did in Afghanistan with Mujahideen for example by having the CIA essentially arm everybody that we can find that looks like he might be a freedom fighter, only to discover months or maybe half a year or so later that they're anything but freedom fighters. 
Indeed, they're using some of the weapons that we sold them on our troops or on our own formations is just not the answer. It simply doesn't work clandestinely or openly to the support elements in these conflicts that we know basically don't have a hares breath chance of winning. The mistake in Syria has been as I said all along. That is our attempt to get rid of Bashar al-Assad. We need to face up to that mistake. We need to be more receptive to his remaining in power and some guys. The best we can probably get at the negotiating table is that maybe hell be gone sometime in the unspecified future. 
But we need to understand that sometimes we have to give a little too, especially if we want to stop the bloodshed in Syria which is reaching proportions where everyone in the world ought to be appalled at. 
PERIES: Alright Larry. I look forward to your report next week as things really escalate and intensify over Syria. Thank you for joining us. 
WILKERSON: Well lets hope that no one else decides to throw in their lot with the forces in Syria. China and Russia are quite enough, thank you very much. 
PERIES: Indeed. I thank you again and thank you for joining us on the Real News Network. 0 0 0 0 0 0

Yves here. Germany seems determined to test the Eurozone experiment to destruction. As we've long said, it insists on contradictory aims: running large trade surpluses, not being willing to finance them, and not permitting high levels of fiscal spending to serve as another mechanism to provide for transfers to 'deficit' countries. By contrast, people in New York and California don't even think much about the fact that they are getting less out of the Federal government than they pay in taxes and are effectiely supporting consumption in places like Mississippi. 
By Wouter den Haan, Professor of Economics and Co-Director of the Centre for Macroeconomics, London School of Economics; Martin Ellison, Professor of Economics at the University of Oxford; Ethan Ilzetzki, Assistant Professor, London School of Economics; Michael McMahon, Associate Professor of the Department of Economics, University of Warwick; and Ricardo Reis, A.W. Phillips Professor of Economics, LSE. Originally published at VoxEU 
The October 2016 expert survey of the Centre for Macroeconomics (CFM) and CEPR invited views from a panel of macroeconomists based across Europe on Germany's trade surplus, its impact on the Eurozone economy, and the appropriate response of German fiscal policy. More than two-thirds of the respondents agree with the proposition that German current account surpluses are a threat to the Eurozone economy. A slightly smaller majority believe that the German government ought to increase public investment in response to the surpluses. 
Germany posted a record-high current account surplus of 8.5% of GDP in 2015; indeed, the German surplus has overtaken China's surplus as the largest in the world. Germany's current account was slightly in deficit when the euro was created in the late 1990s, it steadily increased in the early 2000s and has continued to rise since the Global Crisis of 2008. Since 2010, the increase in the current account has been accompanied by fiscal surpluses, with the German government moving from a deficit of 4% of GDP in 2010 to a surplus of 1.2% in the first half of 2016. Global Imbalances 
Through the prism of the trade balance, the current account surplus can be viewed as a symptom of Germany's economic success. German exports increased from 30% of GDP in 2000 to 47% in 2015. But with imports at merely 39% of GDP, this implies that Germany is providing capital to the rest of the world at a very high rate. Indeed, German savings have increased from roughly 20% to nearly 30% of GDP, while domestic investment has remained roughly constant at around 20% of GDP. 
One view, harking back to Keynes, is that such large capital flows could be very destabilising, particularly within a system of fixed exchange rates (or a currency union). The argument is that while countries with current account deficits may come under severe pressure to adjust, countries with surpluses face no corresponding pressures. 1 Keynes's solution – which was part of the inspiration for the creation of the IMF – was that occasional exchange rate adjustments might be necessary in order to rebalance international credit flows. 
A number of commentators have suggested that Germany's large current account surpluses reflect such imbalances. Paul Krugman attributes the Eurozone crisis in part to Germany's current account surplus. The capital flows that this current account financed dried up as the crisis unfolded. But the burden of the adjustment fell solely on the Eurozone periphery, which closed their current account deficits, without the aid of Germany where the current account has only increased. In this view, German fiscal surpluses are an international version of the paradox of thrift. 2 
The IMF (2016) and the European Commission (2016) have both warned of the risks of Germany's current account surpluses; and both have urged Germany to take actions to reduce its external surplus, for example, by increasing public investment. 
While the nature of the Eurozone makes exchange rate adjustments impossible, the IMF reckons that Germany's real exchange rate is now 15-20% undervalued (IMF 2016, p. 7). The US Treasury has gone so far as to add Germany to its 'monitoring list' of countries engaged in 'unfair currency practices', even though Germany does not have a national currency (US Treasury 2016). 
In contrast, Jens Weidmann, President of the Bundesbank, has argued that German net capital outflows are primarily structural, resulting from Germany's high level of economic development and ageing population. He also argues that the Eurozone's common monetary policy allowed slower current account adjustments, thus mitigating the Eurozone crisis (Weidmann 2014). The German economics ministry claims that Germany's surplus is 'a sign of the competitiveness of the German economy and global demand for quality products from Germany'. 3 
The first question in the October 2016 expert survey of the Centre for Macroeconomics (CFM) and CEPR addressed the question of whether large German surpluses are reasons for concern. 4 To focus the question, we asked the experts about its consequences for the Eurozone, but they were free to address wider implications in their comments. 
Q1: Do you agree that German current account surpluses are a threat to the Eurozone economy? 


Sixty-seven panel members answered this question and a large majority (69%) agree or strongly agree with the proposition. A number of panel members point to evidence of the risks of current account balances. Ricardo Reis (LSE), for example, says that 'current account imbalances during 2000-08 played a central role in the Eurozone crisis of 2010-12' (see Obstfeld 2012 and Lane 2013). 
Other panel members suggest that German current account surpluses are a symptom of the common European currency. Michael Wickens (Cardiff Business School and University of York) warns that 'the main underlying problem is the single currency. Germany's current account surplus reflects its competitiveness, but due to the single currency, it can't appreciate against the Eurozone countries with chronic current account deficits. It is all reminiscent of the failures of the Bretton Woods system, which of course eventually collapsed due to currencies becoming misaligned.' 
Simon Wren-Lewis (Oxford) agrees that 'the surplus represents an undervalued real exchange rate in Germany, which requires more inflation in Germany relative to the rest of the Eurozone'. 
Wouter Den Haan (LSE) suggests that the problem is exacerbated by conditions in the Eurozone periphery: 'There is a very good chance that the Eurozone is in a bad equilibrium in which consumers do not spend because they are concerned about future earnings and firms are hesitant to hire workers and raise wages because they are concerned about demand for their products. Even if this is not behind the high savings rate in Germany, it does make this increase in precautionary savings more problematic in the periphery.' 
A number of panel members (Charles Bean, LSE; Jonathan Portes, National Institute of Economic and Social Research) warn that Germany's current account surplus is not uniquely a Eurozone problem, but is also large enough to contribute to the low global real interest rates. 
The global dimension is also the main counter-argument of the panel members who think that the German current account is not a threat to Eurozone stability. Robert Kollman (Université Libre de Bruxelles) points out that 'the German current account surpluses do not represent a threat to the Eurozone economy, because Germany trades more with the rest of the world than with the rest of the Eurozone'. 
Pietro Reichlin (Università LUISS G. Carli) caveats his concern about the German current account with the view that 'part of the surplus is due to exports to extra-European countries and these benefit some EU peripheral economies that are exporting intermediate inputs and parts to Germany'. 
Others do not feel that there are theoretical grounds for concern about the German current account. Francesco Lippi (Università di Sassari) argues: 'I do not see why the savings of my neighbour should be a problem for me. Rather, they are a potential source of financing my investment. I do not know a single reasonable model where current account surpluses are a problem.' 
Robert Kollman points to research that the key shocks driving the German current account shocks are not central to the Eurozone's ills (see Kollmann et al. 2015, 2016). Nezih Guner (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona) agrees that German current account surpluses are structural: 'current account surpluses partly reflect positive supply shocks (such as labour market reforms that lowered wages and made German economy more competitive) and the current demographic structure that results in high savings rates.' Germany's Fiscal Policy 
With exchange rate adjustment off the table within a currency union, the main policy recommendation to reduce Germany's current account surplus has been a change in German fiscal policy. Martin Wolf points out that the current account surplus is driven primarily by an increase in the supply of savings of German households and thus reflects insufficient aggregate demand. 5 He warns that Germany isn't carrying its weight in the global economy and has failed to contribute to global aggregate demand. 
By this view, the German government's move to fiscal surplus is a direct drag on the global recovery. The argument is that with interest rates at zero and other governments in worse fiscal positions, the German government should do more to contribute to European and global demand. 
The IMF has called on Germany to 'focus on raising potential growth and reinforcing rebalancing, which will also support the fragile recovery in the euro area', including the use of fiscal resources to 'boost high quality public investment'. 
The European Commission concurs that 'weak investment has contributed to the high and persistent current account surplus and poses risks for the future growth potential of the German economy'. The Commission joins the IMF in suggesting that 'there continues to be fiscal space for higher public investment, while complying with the rules of the stability and growth pact'. 
In contrast, Jens Weidmann suggests that an expansionary German fiscal policy will do little to spur demand in the Eurozone periphery as the import component of Germany public spending is merely 9%. And while Willem Buiter agrees that Germany's current account surplus is excessive, he thinks that fiscal expansion may not be consistent with German inflation stability and that the European Central Bank should finance fiscal expansions elsewhere. 6 
The second question in our survey asked the experts whether the current account imbalance is a reason for the German government to increase public spending. We were not asking whether public spending should increase for other reasons (say low interest rates), although current conditions may – of course – affect the answers given. 
The question was explicitly conditioned on the fact that Germany is part of the Eurozone and we asked the respondents to answer from the point of view of the Eurozone. That is, when countries' fiscal deficits are high, the Eurozone regularly demands that action is taken to reduce public spending: so does it similarly make sense for the Eurozone to ask Germany to increase public spending given its large current account surplus? 
Q2: Do you agree that the German government should increase public spending given its persistently large current account surplus and given that it is part of the Eurozone? 


Sixty-seven panel members answered this question with a large majority (67%) agreeing or strongly agreeing that the German government ought to increase public spending in response to the current account surpluses. 
Panel members who think that the German current account poses risks to Eurozone stability largely supported policy action. The main policy recommendation is an increase in public investment. Stefan Gerlach (BSI Bank) proposes that 'more public spending on specific public infrastructure projects that pass a careful cost-benefit analysis and contributes to economic growth would be desirable.' 
Sweder van Wijnbergen (Universiteit van Amsterdam) notes that 'Germany's (public capital)/GDP ratio is HALF of the comparable ratio in the Netherlands'. In contrast, Nezih Guner thinks that public investment might be counterproductive: 'Public spending on investment incentives or infrastructure, for example, can further enhance the productivity advantage of German economy and can very well make the situation worse.' 
Another argument in favour of a German fiscal expansion relates to the asymmetry of fiscal rules in the Eurozone. Costas Milas (University of Liverpool) points out that 'the EU Treaty talks about 'corrective' fiscal measures when the deficit exceeds 3% of a country's GDP. There is no similar mechanism in case of a (relatively) big fiscal surplus'. 
Ricardo Reis, on the other hand, states that 'the Treaties do not put the European institutions in charge of aggregate demand management. Therefore, it makes perfect sense for there to be a pronounced asymmetry between requiring the reduction of fiscal deficits, but having nothing to say about fiscal surpluses.' But he does suggest that discretionary policy is desirable at this point in time: 'It seems likely that both Germany and the rest of the Eurozone would benefit from some fiscal expansion in Germany… Given the increase in the primary surplus since 2004, there also seems to be some room to do so.' 
A number of panel members support policy action, but not an increase in public spending. Francesco Giavazzi (IGIER, Università Bocconi) and Nicholas Oulton (LSE) advocate tax cuts. In addition, Jürgen von Hagen (Universität Bonn) warns that fiscal action is desirable at the federal level, but not at the state level: 'Lander public finances are mostly unsustainable and an increase in spending is not called for.' Wendy Carlin (University College London) proposes increasing incentives for women to participate in the labour force. 
Panel members who are opposed to German fiscal action largely point to the limited evidence that such action would reverse the current account surplus. Gernot Müller (Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen) points out that 'evidence to date suggests that the link between fiscal policy and the current account is weak. In fact, not even the sign of how a fiscal expansion impacts the current account is clear (see Kim and Roubini's 2008 paper on twin divergence).' 
Evi Pappa (European University Institute) adds: 'In my own research, I also show that fiscal consolidation, as a means to induce an internal devaluation in a two country model works, but it affects very little economic activity in the periphery. A more effective way for correcting current account imbalances is transferring resources from Germany to the periphery' (see bandiera et al. 2016).

By Wolf Richter, a San Francisco based executive, entrepreneur, start up specialist, and author, with extensive international work experience. Originally published at Wolf Street 
Five years ago, when Google announced that it would build a super-high-speed fiber-optic network in Kansas City, and then roll it out in other cities, it started an effort to own and control the data pipelines going into homes and businesses. 
Given how frustrated consumers are with their ISPs, it seems people couldn't wait for Google Fiber, now operated by Alphabet's Access. Google then spent a fortune building out the network in select cities around the country. This could have been huge . At a huge cost. 
'Amazing bet,' is what Craig Barratt, senior VP at Alphabet and CEO of Access, called Google Fiber in a blogpost yesterday. In the same breath, he also announced that they would 'pause' the build-out of Google Fiber in cities where it had been planned, that there would be layoffs and reassignments, though he didn't say how many, and that he'd 'step aside' as CEO of Access. 
His replacement has not been announced. 
He's the third CEO of an Alphabet division to part ways since June. He prefaced this whole debacle this way: 
And thanks to the hard work of everyone on the Access team, our business is solid: our subscriber base and revenue are growing quickly, and we expect that growth to continue. I am extremely proud of what we've built together in five short years. 
Google Fiber is one of two big entities in 'Other Bets' of the Alphabet empire, whose CEO Larry Page and new-ish CFO Ruth Porat are trying to crack down on ballooning costs. 
The other big entity in 'Other Bets' is Nest Labs, which makes internet-connected thermostats and the like. In a brilliant move, Google had acquired it in 2014 for a breath-taking $3.2 billion. But by now, this move has become very unbrilliant. 
In June, Tony Fadell, Nest co-founder and CEO, quit after internal disputes over this focus on spending. Some key Nest employees moved to Google's new hardware division. And the entity is in turmoil. 
In August, Bill Maris, CEO of Google's venture capital arm, GV, also left. 
Earlier this year, Alphabet got second thoughts about its ambitious robotics efforts and put Boston Dynamics up for sale. It had acquired the experimental robot maker in 2013 for $500 million. But tensions soon arose, and co-founder Andy Rubin bailed out in 2014. No deal yet. 
Then there was, infamously, Google Glass…. 
So Google Fiber is in good company. It will cease efforts to install a fiber network in 10 cities where it had been planned but not fully committed, according to Ars Technica . In addition, San Francisco was supposed to get Google fiber for sure, but that has now been cancelled too. 
The 11 cities where Google Fiber has been nixed: Chicago, Dallas, Jacksonville, Los Angeles, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, and Tampa. 
In 'this handful of cities' and also 'in certain related areas of our supporting operations, we'll be reducing our employee base,' Barratt wrote. Hence the layoffs. 
Google Fiber has already been rolled out in Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Kansas City (Missouri and Kansas), Nashville, Provo (Utah), Salt Lake City, and The Triangle (North Carolina). And it's still publicly committed to building the network – subject to change, I suppose – in Huntsville (Alabama), Irvine (California), San Antonio, and Louisville. 
In June, Google Fiber announced that it would acquire Webpass, a 13-year-old company that provides high-speed wireless internet in Boston, Chicago, Miami, San Diego, Oakland, and San Francisco. A wireless network is a lot cheaper to install in urban areas with multi-family housing than fiber-to-the-home. 
About 9% of the employees at Access will lose their jobs, though some people could be reassigned to entities of Alphabet, according to Ars Technica: 
The source did not say exactly how many employees that percentage represents. Access includes more than just Google Fiber, so the percentage of Google Fiber employees being laid off or reassigned is probably a little higher. 
Alphabet headcounts are hard to come by, but this Bloomberg report says Access has about 1,500 employees. The Information report indicates that Google Fiber had about 1,000 employees before the layoffs. If both of those numbers are accurate, then the percentage of Google Fiber employees being laid off or reassigned to other parts of Alphabet might be around 13.5 percent. 
Google Fiber apparently has not hit its subscriber goals, and fiber construction is a costly endeavor. While the company isn't giving up on fiber entirely, it may be able to deploy Internet service at a lower cost using wireless technology. 
'It's billions of dollars a year just to maintain this stuff, and Google doesn't want to spend that kind of money on just being another player in that market,' Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, told Bloomberg . 
'I think the new CFO put an end to the experiment that wasn't really going anywhere,' Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless industry analyst, told Bloomberg . 
So serving up digital ads is still Alphabet's main business, and flourishing. Controlling the high-speed pipeline to get these ads into homes and businesses, and grabbing whatever data can be grabbed by ISPs via deep-packet inspection and other methods still seems to be part of the plan, but now through cheaper and less glamorous wireless services and no longer through the holy grail of data pipelines, optical fiber. And so goes another huge dream to diversity away from advertising.

TTP, TTIP, TISA 
CETA: 'EU's Canada free-trade CETA deal could be back on as Walloons agree to last-minute deal' [ Telegraph ]. 'Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel said that Wallonia was now in agreement, and the regional parliaments may now agree to CETA by the end of Friday night, opening the door to the deal being signed. Mr Tusk said that once the regional votes had taken place, he will inform Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Any extra concessions given to Wallonia may mean other countries will want to look again at the deal, however.' (The BBC's headline, then — 'EU-Canada trade deal: Belgians break Ceta deadlock' — is quite irresponsible. As is– 
CETA: 'Belgium breaks Ceta deadlock' [ EUObserver ]. Not quite: 
Belgium's political entities agreed to a declaration on Thursday (26 October), which gives their government a green light to sign Ceta, the EU-Canada trade pact. 
The agreement was promptly sent to EU ambassadors in Brussels, to be discussed later in the afternoon. 
After a week of marathon negotiations, Belgian prime minister Charles Michel said that Thursday's talks had calmed 'outstanding concerns'. 
As part of the trade-off, Belgium will ask the European Court of Justice to clarify the proposed investment court system, which was one of the most controversial elements of the trade deal. 
Ceta was due to be signed off by EU leaders and Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau at a summit in Brussels on Thursday. Trudeau cancelled the trip during the night as no agreement had been reached in Brussels. 
It's not known when the summit will take place, or whether the Belgian go-ahead was the last hurdle. 
The other 27 EU countries must first accept the Belgian deal. 
At their meeting on Thursday, EU ambassadors will be accompanied by lawyers and representatives of the EU institutions, who will examine the legality and consequences of the text. 
The Walloon parliament will vote on the agreement on Friday. 
Still, how do we slay these undead deals? The same thing happened with TPP. 
CETA: 'The great CETA swindle' [ Corporate Europe Observatory ]. 'The latest PR move is a 'joint interpretative declaration' on the trade deal hammered out by Ottawa and Brussels and published by investigative journalist collective Correctiv last Friday. It is designed to alleviate public concerns but in fact does nothing to fix CETA's flaws. In September, Canada's Trade Minister, Chrystia Freeland, and her German counterpart, Sigmar Gabriel, had announced such a text to appease Social Democrats, trade unions and the wider public who fear that CETA would threaten public services, labour and environmental standards and undermine governments' right to regulate in the public interest. Several governments, notably Austria, had linked their 'yes' to CETA to the declaration. [But] According to environmental group Greenpeace, the declaration therefore has the 'legal weight of a holiday brochure'.' 
Legal experts have also warned that the declaration 'could be misleading for non-lawyers, who might think that the Declaration will alter or override the CETA'. But it does not change CETA's legal terms – and it is these terms which have raised concerns. As Canadian law Professor Gus van Harten explains: 'Based on principles of treaty interpretation, the CETA will be interpreted primarily according to the text of its relevant provisions…. The Declaration would play a subsidiary role, if any, in this interpretative process.' In other words, legally (and thus politically), the CETA text is far more important than the declaration – and the former could prevail over the latter in case of a conflictive interpretation. 
The post then goes on to analyze the provisions of the declaration in detail, comparing them to the text. (Readers may remember that TPP advocates have made the same sort of claim for the TPP Preamble, which the text also over-rides . So, the Belgians are smart to get a court ruling on this. And we might also expect the adminsitration to use similar tactics to (the toothless distraction of) the CETA 'resolution' in the upcoming attempt to pass the TPP. 
'Belgian officials were discussing a working document aimed at addressing Wallonia's concerns on the trade deal. The document, published by Belgian state media RTBF, shows that Belgium is moving toward requesting additional safeguards for the agricultural sector 'in cases of market turbulence.' It also puts forward a number of requests regarding the investor court system, including 'progressing towards hiring judges on a permanent basis'' [ Politico ]. This seems to be a different document from the 'declaration'; it was leaked by a different source. Here is is; it's in French . 
TPP: 'Eight major financial services industry associations made an appeal to congressional leaders to support passage of the TPP this year, arguing that the deal is 'vital to ensuring that the U.S. financial services sector remains a vibrant engine for domestic and global growth'' [ Politico ]. What the heck is a 'vibrant engine'? Maybe a screw loose or something? Needs a tightening to stop the shaking and shimmying? 
TPP: 'Health, labor and consumer groups are warning President Barack Obama to refrain from including a 12-year monopoly period for biological drugs in legislation to implement the TPP as a means for addressing congressional concerns over the pact. The groups argue that such a move could undermine future efforts to shorten that protection period under U.S. law' [ Politico ]. 'The letter, signed by Doctors Without Borders, the AFL-CIO, AARP, Oxfam and Consumers Union, also expresses concern over reports that the administration is prepared to negotiate side letters with TPP countries to reinforce U.S. lawmaker demands that countries respect a 12-year protection period, which reflects U.S. law.'

'As a longtime Bill Clinton adviser came under fire several years ago for alleged conflicts of interest involving a private consulting firm and the Clinton Foundation, he mounted an audacious defense: Bill Clinton's doing it, too' [ Politico ]. 
'The unusual and brash rejoinder from veteran Clinton aide and Teneo Consulting co-founder Doug Band is scattered across the thousands of hacked emails published by WikiLeaks, but a memo released Wednesday provides the most detailed look to date at the intertwined worlds of nonprofit, for-profit, official and political activities involving Clinton and many of his top aides. 
The memo at one point refers bluntly to the money-making part of Clinton's life as 'Bill Clinton Inc.' and notes that in at least one case a company — global education firm Laureate International Universities — began paying Clinton personally after first being a donor to the Clinton Foundation. 
I think it's important for young women and girls to see that a corrupt dynasty can occupy the White House a second time.

'Goldman Sachs: Election Won't End Like Brexit' [Barrons, via Across the Curve ]. 'We think that the upcoming U.S. election won't end up as another Brexit-styled surprise for for two reasons.' 
First, and most importantly, whole both situations represented an opportunity for voters to endorse a change in the status quo, voters in the UK were asked to decide on an idea whereas in the US they are being asked to decide on a person. The distinction is illustrated in US polling by the difference between the small share of Americans who believe the country is moving in the right direction (29%) and majority who approve of the job President Obama is doing (52%). 
Second. While the polls conducted on the eve of the referendum vote showed 'remain' with a 4.6pp lead, in contrast to the 3.8pp actual vote margin in favor of 'leave', an average of polls published by the Economist magazine the day before the election showed a tied race, and showed 'leave' leading for much of the prior month. As much as 10% of the public in many of these surveys was also undecided. By contrast, Sec. Clinton has led the average of presidential polls consistently for more than a year, with the exception of one week in late July following the Republican convention, and for most of the last year her lead has been substantial, averaging 4pp since the last primary elections were held.

This year, however, is the first time in at least six decades that the Democratic nominee is positioned to win a majority of these upscale voters' [ New York Times ]. 'What these figures suggest is that the 2016 election will represent a complete inversion of the New Deal order among white voters. From the 1930s into the 1980s and early 1990s, majorities of downscale whites voted Democratic and upscale whites voted Republican. Now, looking at combined male and female vote totals, the opposite is true.'

Warren and progressive policy groups such as the Roosevelt Institute are 'developing a hit list of the types of people they'll oppose—what one source called 'hell no' appointments—in a Clinton administration.'' Well, we can but hope that the Roosevelt Institute has improved since 2011 . Readers?

ARTICLE

by Yves Smith 
Yves here. It's hardly a secret that the Clintons are deeply loyal to Wall Street. Bob Rubin and his numerous well-heeled followers are a powerful, arguably dominant, faction in the Democratic party, and they are tightly aligned with the Clintons. 
Nomi Prins gives a useful overview of how Hillary has attempted to blame the financial crisis on everything but the deregulation that her husband supported and the reckless behavior that resulted and how her anti-bank noises, like her criticism of Wells Fargo, is tepid and late in coming. 
However, I quibble with some of her article. It's surprising to see her single out Gary Gensler, former head of the CFTC, as a bank crony. Gensler is widely seen as pushing for much tougher oversight and enforcement despite being in the disadvantaged position of being at a secondary regulator. Recall that he was up against Bernanke and Geithner, a weak Mary Shapiro at the SEC, and an indifferent-to-captured Obama at the helm. 
It's also surprising to see Prins fail to mention the cronies rumored to be Clinton's top picks for Treasury Secretary: Larry Fink of BlackRock and Tony James of Blackstone. Both firms would profit ginormously if the Wall Street looting plan that Hillary supports and James is promoting, that of having all workers pay 3% of their pay into mandatory retirement accounts, were to become law. 
As we've indicated, the cost of this 'fix' is greater than any of the ideas proposed to shore up Social Security (as opposed to cut it by stealth). I hate to say it, but I believe Prins' failure to flag this risk is due to her still hewing to orthodox financial views and thus believing that Federal deficits are a problem, as opposed to desirable, most of the time, and regarding senior members of the asset management heavyweights as less dangerous than executives of TBTF banks. Since even the modest re-regulation that has taken place since the crisis has increased shadow banking, and firms like Blackrock and Blackstone are major players, it would be naive to depict them as problem-free and disinterested. 
By Nomi Prins, a former Wall Street executive and the author of six books of which the most recent is All the Presidents' Bankers: The Hidden Alliances That Drive American Power (Nation Books). Originally published at TomDispatch 
As this endless election limps toward its last days, while spiraling into a bizarre duel over vote-rigging accusations, a deep sigh is undoubtedly in order. The entire process has been an emotionally draining, frustration-inducing, rage-inflaming spectacle of repellent form over shallow substance. For many, the third debate evoked fatigue. More worrying, there was again no discussion of how to prevent another financial crisis, an ominous possibility in the next presidency, whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton enters the Oval Office — given that nothing fundamental has been altered when it comes to Wall Street's practices and predation. 
At the heart of American political consciousness right now lies a soul-crushing reality for millions of distraught Americans: the choices for president couldn't be feebler or more disappointing. On the one hand, we have a petulant, vocabulary-challenged man-boar of a billionaire, who hasn't paid his taxes, has regularly left those supporting him holding the bag , and seems like a ludicrous composite of every bad trait in every bad date any woman has ever had. On the other hand, we're offered a walking photo-op for and well-paid speechmaker to Wall-Street CEOs, a one-woman money-raising machine from the 1% of the 1%, who, despite a folksiness that couldn't look more rehearsed, has methodically outplayed her opponent. 
With less than two weeks to go before E-day — despite the Trumptilian upheaval of the last year — the high probability of a Clinton win means the establishment remains intact. When we awaken on November 9th, it will undoubtedly be dawn in Hillary Clinton's America and that potentially means four years of an economic dystopia that will (as would Donald Trump's version of the same) leave many Americans rightfully anxious about their economic futures. 
None of the three presidential debates suggested that either candidate would have the ability (or desire) to confront Wall Street from the Oval Office. In the second and third debates, in case you missed them, Hillary didn't even mention the Glass-Steagall Act, too big to fail, or Wall Street. While in the first debate, the subject of Wall Street only came up after she disparaged the tax policies of ' Trumped-up, trickle down economics ' (or, as I like to call it, the Trumpledown economics of giving tax and financial benefits to the rich and to corporations). 
In this election, Hillary has crafted her talking points regarding the causes of the last financial crisis as weapons against Trump, but they hardly begin to tell the real story of what happened to the American economy. The meltdown of 2007-2008 was not mainly due to 'tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy' or a 'failure to invest in the middle class,' two subjects she has repeatedly highlighted to slam the Republicans and their candidate. It was a byproduct of the destruction of the regulations that opened the way for a too-big-to-fail framework to thrive. Under the presidency of Bill Clinton, Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era act that once separated people's bank deposits and loans from any kind of risky bets or other similar actions in which banks might engage, was repealed under the Financial Modernization Act of 1999. In addition, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act was passed, which allowed Wall Street to concoct devastating unregulated side bets on what became the subprime crisis. 
Given that the people involved with those choices are still around and some are still advising (or in the case of one former president living with) Hillary Clinton, it's reasonable to imagine that, in January 2017, she'll launch the third term of Bill Clinton when it comes to financial policy, banks, and the economy. Only now, the stakes are even higher, the banks larger, and their impunity still remarkably unchallenged. 
Consider President Obama's current treasury secretary, Jack Lew. It was Hillary who hit the Clinton Rolodex to bring him back to Washington. Lew first entered Bill Clinton's White House in 1993 as special assistant to the president. Between his stints working for Clinton and Obama, he made his way into the private sector and eventually to Wall Street — as so many of his predecessors had done and successors would do. He scored a leadership role with Citigroup during the time that Bill Clinton's former Treasury Secretary (and former Goldman Sachs co-Chairman ) Robert Rubin was on its board of directors. In 2009 , Hillary selected him to be her deputy secretary of state. 
Lew is hardly the only example of the busy revolving door to power that led from the Clinton administration to the Obama administration via Wall Street (or activities connected to it). Bill Clinton's Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs , Timothy Geithner worked with Robert Rubin, later championed Wall Street as president and CEO of the New York Federal Reserve while Hillary was senator from New York (representing Wall Street), and then became Obama's first treasury secretary while Hillary was secretary of state . 
One possible contender for treasury secretary in a new Clinton administration would be Bill Clinton's Under Secretary of Domestic Finance and Obama's Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, Gary Gensler (who was — I'm sure you won't be shocked — a Goldman Sachs partner before entering public service). These, then, are typical inhabitants of the Clinton inner circle and of the political-financial corridors of power. Their thinking, like Hillary's, meshes well with support for the status quo in the banking system, even if, like her, they are willing on occasion to admonish it for its 'mistakes.' 
This thru-line of personnel in and out of Clinton World is dangerous for most of the rest of us, because behind all the 'talking heads' and genuinely amusing Saturday Night Live skits about this bizarre election lie certain crucial issues that will have to be dealt with: decisions about climate change, foreign wars, student-loan unaffordability, rising income inequality , declining social mobility , and, yes, the threat of another financial crisis. And keep in mind that such a future economic meltdown isn't an absurdly long-shot possibility. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve, the nation's main bank regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , the government entity that insures our bank deposits, collectively noted that seven of our biggest eight banks — Citigroup was the exception — still have inadequate emergency plans in the event of another financial crisis. 
Exploring a Two-Faced World 
Politicians regularly act one way publicly and another privately, as Hillary was 'outed' for doing by WikiLeaks via its document dump from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's hacked email account. Such realities should be treated as neither shockers nor smoking guns. Everybody postures. Everybody lies. Everybody's two-faced in certain aspects of their lives. Politicians just make a career out of it. 
What's problematic about Hillary's public and private positions in the economic sphere, at least, isn't their two-facedness but how of a piece they are. Yes, she warned the bankers to ' cut it out ! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors!'— but that was no demonstration of strength in relation to the big banks. Her comments revealed no real understanding of their precise role in exacerbating a fixable subprime loan calamity and global financial crisis, nor did her finger-wagging mean anything to Wall Street. 
Keep in mind that, during the build-up to that crisis, as banks took advantage of looser regulations, she collected more than $7 million from the securities and investment industry for her New York Senate runs ( $18 million during her career). In her first Senate campaign, Citigroup was her top contributor. The four Wall-Street-based banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) all feature among her top 10 career contributors. As a senator, she didn't introduce any bills aimed at reforming or regulating Wall Street. During the lead-up to the financial crisis of 2007-2008, she did introduce five (out of 140) bills relating to the housing crisis, but they all died before making it through a Senate committee. So did a bill she sponsored to curtail corporate executive compensation. Though she has publicly called for a reduction in hedge-fund tax breaks (known as 'closing the carried interest loophole'), including at the second debate , she never signed on to the bill that would have done so (one that Obama co-sponsored in 2007). Perhaps her most important gesture of support for Wall Street was her vote in favor of the $700 billion 2008 bank bailout bill. (Bernie Sanders opposed it.) 
After her secretary of state stint, she returned to the scene of banking crimes. Many times. As we know, she was also paid exceedingly well for it. Friendship with the Clintons doesn't come cheap . As she said in October 2013, while speaking at a Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments' Symposium, 'running for office in our country takes a lot of money, and candidates have to go out and raise it. New York is probably the leading site for contributions for fundraising for candidates on both sides of the aisle.' 
Between 2013 and 2015, she gave 12 speeches to Wall Street banks, private equity firms, and other financial corporations, reaping a whopping $2,935,000 for them. In her 2016 presidential run, the securities and investment sector (aka Wall Street) has contributed the most of any industry to PACs supporting Hillary: $56.4 million . 
Yes, everybody needs to make a buck or a few million of them. This is America after all, but Hillary was a political figure paid by the same banks routinely getting slapped with criminal settlements by the Department of Justice. In addition, the Clinton Foundation counted as generous donors all four of the major Wall Street-based mega-banks. She was voracious when it came to such money and tone-deaf when it came to the irony of it all. 
Glass-Steagall and Bernie Sanders 
One of the more illuminating aspects of the Podesta emails was a series of communications that took place in the fall of 2015. That's when Bernie Sanders was gaining traction for, among other things, his calls to break up the big banks and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. The Clinton administration's dismantling of that act in 1999 had freed the big banks to use their depositors' money as collateral for risky bets in the real estate market and elsewhere, and so allowed them to become ever more engorged with questionable securities. 
On December 7, 2015, with her campaign well underway and worried about the Sanders challenge, the Clinton camp debuted a key Hillary op-ed , 'How I'd Rein in Wall Street,' in the New York Times . This followed two months of emails and internal debate within her campaign over whether supporting the return of Glass-Steagall was politically palatable for her and whether not supporting it would antagonize Senator Elizabeth Warren. In the end, though Glass-Steagall was mentioned in passing in her op-ed, she chose not to endorse its return. 
She explained her decision not to do so this way (and her advisers and media apostles have stuck with this explanation ever since): 'Some have urged the return of a Depression-era rule called Glass-Steagall , which separated traditional banking from investment banking. But many of the firms that contributed to the crash in 2008, like A.I.G. and Lehman Brothers, weren't traditional banks, so Glass-Steagall wouldn't have limited their reckless behavior. Nor would restoring Glass-Steagall help contain other parts of the ‘shadow banking' sector, including certain activities of hedge funds, investment banks, and other non-bank institutions.' 
Her entire characterization of how the 2007-2008 banking crisis unfolded was — well — wrong. Here's how traditional banks (like JPMorgan Chase) operated: they lent money to investment banks like Lehman Brothers so that they could buy more financial waste products stuffed with subprime mortgages that these traditional banks were, in turn, trying to sell. They then backed up those toxic financial products through insurance companies like AIG, which came close to collapse when what it was insuring became too toxically overwhelming to afford. AIG then got a $182 billion government bailout that also had the effect of bailing out those traditional banks (including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which became 'traditional' during the crisis). In this way, the whole vicious cycle started with the traditional banks that hold your deposits and at the same time could produce and sell those waste products thanks to the repeal of Glass-Steagall. So yes, the loss of that act caused the crisis and, in its wake, every big traditional bank was fined for crisis-related crimes. 
Hillary won't push to bring back Glass-Steagall. Doing so would dismantle her husband's legacy and that of the men he and she appointed to public office. Whatever cosmetic alterations may be in store, count on that act remaining an artifact of the past, since its resurrection would dismay the bankers who, over the past three decades, made the Clintons what they are. 
No wonder many diehard Sanders supporters remain disillusioned and skeptical — not to speak of the fact that their candidate featured dead last ( 39th ) on a list of recommended vice presidential candidates in the Podesta emails. That's unfortunately how much his agenda is likely to matter to her in the Oval Office. 
Go Regulate Yourselves! 
Before he resigned with his nine-figure golden parachute, Wells Fargo CEO and Chairman John Stumpf addressed Congress over disclosures that 5,300 of his employees had created two million fake accounts, scamming $2.4 million from existing customers. The bank was fined $ 185 million for that (out of a total $10 billion in fines for a range of other crimes committed before and during the financial crisis). 
In response, Hillary wrote a letter to Wells Fargo's customers. In it, she didn't actually mention Stumpf by name, as she has not mentioned any Wall Street CEO by name in the context of criminal activity. Instead, she simply spoke of 'he.' As she put it, 'He owes all of you a clear explanation as to how this happened under his watch.' She added, 'Executives should be held individually accountable when rampant illegal activity happens on their watch.' 
She does have a plan to fine banks for being too big, but they've already been fined repeatedly for being crooked and it hasn't made them any smaller or less threatening. As their top officials evidently view the matter, paying up for breaking the law is just another cost of doing business. 
Hillary also wrote, 'If any bank can't be managed effectively, it should be broken up.' But the question is: Why doesn't ongoing criminal activity that threatens the rest of us correlate with ineffective management — or put another way, when was the last time you saw a major bank broken up? And don't hold your breath for that to happen in a new Clinton administration either. 
In her public letter, she added , 'I'll appoint regulators who will stand with taxpayers and consumers, not with big banks and their friends in Congress.' On the other hand, at that same Goldman Sachs symposium , while in fundraising mode, she gave bankers a pass relative to regulators and commented: 'Well, I represented all of you for eight years. I had great relations and worked so close together after 9/11 to rebuild downtown, and [I have] a lot of respect for the work you do and the people who do it.' 
She has steadfastly worked to craft explanations for the financial crisis and the Great Recession that don't endanger the banks as we presently know them. In addition, she has supported the idea of appointing insider regulators, insisting that 'the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.' (Let's not forget that former Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Hank Paulson ran the Treasury Department while the crisis brewed.) 
Among the emails sent to John Podesta that were posted by WikiLeaks is an article I wrote for TomDispatch on the Clintons' relationships with bankers. 'She will not point fingers at her friends,' I said in that piece in May 2015. She will not chastise the people who pay her hundreds of thousands of dollars a pop to speak or the ones who have long shared the social circles in which she and her husband move.' I also suggested that she wouldn't call out any CEO by name. To this day she hasn't. I said that she would never be an advocate for Glass-Steagall. And she hasn't been. What was true then will be no less true once she's in the White House and no longer has to make gestures toward the platform on which Bernie ran and so can once again more openly embrace the bankers' way of conducting business. 
There's a reason Wall Street has a crush on her and its monarchs like Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Lloyd Blankfein pay her such stunning sums to offer anodyne remarks to their employees and others. Blankfein has been coy about an official Clinton endorsement simply because he doesn't want to rock her campaign boat, but make no mistake, this Wall Street kingpin's silence is tantamount to an endorsement. 
To date, $10 trillion worth of assets sits on the books of the Big Six banks. Since 2008, these same banks have copped to more than $ 150 billion in fines for pre-crisis behavior that ranged on the spectrum of criminality from manipulating multiple public markets to outright fraud. Hillary Clinton has arguably taken money that would not have been so available if it weren't for the ill-gotten gains those banks secured. In her usual measured way, albeit with some light admonishments, she has told them what they want to hear: that if they behave — something that in her dictionary of definitions involves little in the way of personalized pain or punishment — so will she. 
So let's recap Hillary's America, past, present, and future. It's a land lacking in meaningful structural reform of the financial system, a place where the big banks have been, and will continue to be, coddled by the government. No CEO will be jailed, no matter how large the fines his bank is saddled with or how widespread the crimes it committed. Instead, he's likely to be invited to the inaugural ball in January. Because its practices have not been adequately controlled or curtailed, the inherent risk that Wall Street poses for Main Street will only grow as bankers continue to use our money to make their bets. (The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act was supposed to help on this score, but has yet to make the big banks any smaller.) 
And here's an obvious corollary to all this: the next bank-instigated economic catastrophe will not be dealt with until it has once again crushed the financial stability of millions of Americans. 
The banks have voted with their dollars on all of this in multiple ways. Hillary won't do anything to upset that applecart. We should have no illusions about what her presidency would mean from a Wall Street vs. Main Street perspective. Certainly, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon doesn't. He effectively endorsed Hillary before a crowd of financial industry players, saying , 'I hope the next president, she reaches across the aisle.' 
For Wall Street, of course, that aisle is essentially illusory, since its players operate so easily and effectively on both sides of it. In Hillary's America, Wall Street will still own Main Street. 0 0 0 0 0 0

White smoke' on EU-Canada trade deal breakthrough Politico 
EU-Canada trade deal salvaged after Belgian regions concede Financial Times. Note the vote is today but everyone acts as if this is a done deal. The Walloons weren't even given a real fig leaf: 
A provision allowing the European Court of Justice to provide an 'opinion' on the legality of the these courts was seized on as a victory by anti-Ceta campaigners, but officials briefed on the declaration said any such opinion would not be binding as there was nothing in the declaration to reopen the Ceta pact.

Private equity shills are readying the Blame Cannon for the industry's widely forecast fall in returns. 
Who are the allies of the private equity firms attempting to villianize as the cause of deteriorating performance? Not the 0.1% Masters of the Universe, who are always and every the sole cause of Good Things but never never to be found when Bad Things occur. No, it's those evil 'populists' interfering with the proper operation of the world according to private equity that is messing up returns. 
We're not making this up. From the Wall Street Journal : 
The rise of 'populist' politicians in western nations could challenge the ability of private-equity firms to do business and make money, according to a report from Hamilton Lane, one of the largest advisers to investors in the industry. 
The backlash against globalization may cause higher taxes on private-equity firms, create more regulation, drive more volatility and restrict economic growth, Hamilton Lane's annual review said. 
This is utterly ludicrous if you've been paying attention. 
From the first half of 2015, the average EBITDA multiple for PE purchases was over 10X, higher than the peak of the last cycle, in 2007. Even limited partners who are leery of saying a bad word about private equity, like CIO Chris Ailman of CalSTRS, described PE acquisitions as 'priced to perfection' . The trading prices of the private equity firms that are public shows that equity market investors believe that private equity firms will not earn any carry fees over the next couple of years. 
And as we've pointed out repeatedly, since the second half of 2015, senior officers of prominent private equity firms have increasingly been warning that private equity returns going forward will be lower than levels of the past. And none of them used Putin, um, Trump, um populism as the excuse for why returns were going to decline. 
Hamilton Lane has more reason than most to blame private equity's declining fortunes on external forces rather than the obvious factors of too much money chasing too many deals, and if the Fed ever pulls it off, rising interest rates being particularly punitive to high risk strategies like private equity, which is fundamentally levered equity. As we've pointed out, private equity has doubled its share of global equity from 2005 to 2014. 
Hamilton Lane is not just a consultant to private equity; it is deeply conflicted by virtue of being a private equity fund of fund manager, which means it needs to play nice with the general partners in order to maintain access to funds. And the limited partners it has advised on private equity need excuses they can take to their boards and broader constituencies when private equity returns fizzle. So it's easy to blame those nasty anti-capitalists rather than admit that private equity has always been a cyclical play and the end of a cycle is nigh. In fact, it should have occurred after the 2007 deal frenzy, but private equity was an accidental beneficiary of central banks''rescue the financial system' emergency operations, and got a stay of execution. 
In a sign that the public is getting smarter about private equity, 80% of the comments on the Wall Street Journal story were not buying what Hamilton Lane was selling. The other 20% were general criticism of populism rather than votes of support for private equity. 
This skew should not be surprising given some of the strained claims Hamilton Lane made. Notice in the quote above that the first, and presumably therefore the most important problem for private equity was 'higher taxes on private-equity firms,' which almost certainly refers to closing the carried interest loophole. But readers are supposed to believe that that would dent their ability to make money for investors, when those investors are almost without exception exempt from US taxes. 
Now some private equity industry members have stomped their feet and said they'd quit if they had to pay more taxes. It's hard to take this hissy fit seriously since there are not other lines of work in which they'd earn remotely comparable pay even with a bigger tax bill. At the largest firms, the typical annual pay is eight figures, and for the top dogs at big and some medium-large funds, nine figures. 
And it's not as if 'talent' makes as much of a difference as the general partners would have you believe. Industry data shows that no one has a secret sauce. Top quartile funds are less likely to perform well in the next period then by chance. An investor in private equity should stop wasting time picking winners. They should try to avoid crooks and otherwise attempt to index. 
So who might leave the industry if anyone? The departures are more likely to take place at the smallest funds or ones with mediocre performance, since the difference in tax treatment would have a bigger impact on the ability of the principals to maintain what is perceived to be an adequate lifestyle. 
Ironically, thinning out the marginal players is if anything likely to be salutary for industry performance. With too much competition for deals, the winning bid is often made by someone who is desperate to win a deal (as in their investors perceive them to be too slow at putting money to work) or not well informed. 
But the Hamilton Lane whinge is a harbinger of the sort of excuses you can expect to hear from both general partners and limited partners over the coming years, the tired old 'whocoulddanode?' in new garb. 0 0 0 0 1 0

Yves here. This article is a sad vignette of how severely central bankers and many economic commentators, in this case one at Westpac, are locked into destructive orthodox thinking. The ECB's unconventional monetary policy experiment has been an abject failure. And the reason should be obvious: businesses don't borrow to expand just because money has gone on sale. They borrow to expand if they see an opportunity and if the cost of funding does not constrain the growth plan. The parties most likely to borrow just because money is cheap are the last ones you want to do that: financial speculators, since the cost of money is one of their biggest costs and zombie businesses, since they will borrow if they can to keep an otherwise failed venture going. 
Notice also that Westpac, presumably following the ECB, views more consumer demand for credit as a good thing. Since more and more economic studies have found that borrowing by households is economically unproductive beyond a modest level, policymakers need to get over the wrongheaded idea that they should promote growth in consumer credit. 
It is also bizarre to see what central bankers have rationalized or ignored in order to persist in increasingly counterproductive monetary experiments. For instance, super low interest rates drain demand by reducing incomes of savers and retirees. Yet the monetary authorities told themselves that pensioners would choose to spend their capital to maintain their lifestyles. That's not what has happened. They've cut spending and even tried increasing saving to make up for lost returns. For the most part, the ones who have eaten into their nest eggs had no choice. Similarly, super low interest rates signal a lack of official confidence about the economy, and unprecedented monetary experiments are very disconcerting to many businessmen. If the officialdom is signaling deflationary risk, the rational response is to save, since goods and services will be cheaper later. 
By David Llewellyn-Smith, founding publisher and former editor-in-chief of The Diplomat magazine, now the Asia Pacific's leading geo-politics website. Originally posted at MacroBusiness 
From Westpac's Elliot Clarke 
A key purpose behind the ECB's alternative easing programs has been to materially improve credit provision and conditions in the Euro Area economy. Exhibiting a lagged relationship with the business cycle and further hampered by the health of European banks, success on this front has been slow and limited. 
As referenced in their most recent policy statement, 'loan dynamics followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014'. However, that has only left annual growth in loans to non-financial corporates and households at 1.9%yr and 1.8%yr respectively at September 2016. 
These are hardly strong outcomes and, of late, there has been a clear lack of momentum, meaning further material gains are unlikely for the forseeable future. Indeed, from the detail of the ECB's own bank lending survey, there is evidence to suggest credit growth is set to slow. 
Starting with non-financial corporates, the ECB survey reports that there is a clear downtrend in current credit demand, with the net per cent of respondents reporting increased demand for credit from firms having peaked in the first quarter of 2016 and consistently declined ever since. 
Expectations of future growth in non-financial corporate loan demand is also in a clear downtrend. Importantly, the peak in the expected series came in mid-2015 (six months ahead of the actual series' peak) and has endured. It should be noted though that the expected series peaked at a high level and is still consistent with positive credit growth – so we are not anticipating an outright contraction in new lending. 
The purpose for new loans for corporates also remains unhelpful to the growth outlook for the real economy. Having improved from mid-2015 to early 2016, the six months to October saw demand for credit to fund fixed asset investment abate. 
Ergo, after a prolonged contraction to mid-2015, it seems a recovery in real investment has failed to launch. This is partly attributable to a lack of confidence in the outlook. But it has also come as a result of loan conditions for firms remaining tight. The ECB's survey suggests conditions have only improved incrementally since mid-2014. 
The above results imply only limited support to job creation and therefore to household incomes. It is unsurprising then that growth in credit to households also looks to be peaking at a fairly modest pace relative to history. 
As for non-financial corporates, households in the Euro Area are clearly benefitting from lower interest rates. Yet the overall credit conditions they are currently experiencing are little changed from a year ago, or indeed late-2013. Note that since end-2013, the average percentage of banks reporting an easing in standards for mortgages and consumer credit has been 2% and 3% respectively. In the three years prior, an average of 14% and 6% of respondents reported tighter conditions each quarter. 
The above analysis does not, of itself, justify the ECB continuing its asset purchases well beyond March 2017 – there are many market and political points that also need to be considered. But it does suggest that credit provision in the Euro Area is not yet self sustaining. Without the ECB's support, the Euro Area's economy; banks; and financial markets will be left in a fragile state, susceptible to any and all economic or financial shocks. 
Add the political strife building across the Continent that is threatening further eurozone fracturing with the Italian referendum in December, Netherlands election in March, French election April-May, German election in September then Italy six months later and there is no way that the ECB can allow economic weakness and/or peripheral funding stress to creep back in.

If you are in the Lone Star State and not too far from Dallas, we hope you'll join us for some post-Halloween fun at a meetup next Wednesday, November 2. 
Steve in Dallas has graciously arranged for us to meet at 
Cantina Laredo 4546 Belt Line Rd Dallas, TX 75244 
As you can see, it is just east of Beltline and Midway, on the south side: 
We'll start at 5:00 PM. I'm sure I'll be there until at least 8 PM. Steve says he's hosted many groups there before, so the manager is fine with us not knowing how many people will join. That means you don't need to worry about there being enough room for everyone if we have the high class problem of really good turnout. 
In all the meetups, readers have really enjoyed getting to chat with other members of the community, so I'm looking forward to another fun event. I am flying into Dallas that AM, so the only caveat is that if the Dallas or NY airports are reported to be having serious problems in the morning, you might double check the site for updates (although I think you should plan on meeting regardless even if I wind up being delayed). See you soon! 0 0 0 0 0 0 This entry was posted in Notices on

GDP, Q3 2016 (Advance Estimate): 'The consumer and the nation's exports are the headliners in third-quarter GDP which topped expectations at an annualized 2.9 percent. Personal consumption expenditures rose at a solid 2.1 percent annualized rate led by the all important durables component which surged at a 9.5 percent rate. Personal consumption was the largest contributor in the quarter, adding 1.5 percentage points to the quarter's rate.' [ Econoday ]. 'Another important positive in the report is a second straight quarter of improvement in what has been the long lagging business investment component. Contributing 0.2 percentage points to GDP, nonresidential fixed investment rose at a 1.2 percent rate on top of the second-quarter's 1.0 percent rate.' But: 'Yes of course, this is an improvement. But the consumer went limp [?], and GDP is gamed with inventory hocus-pocus and export-import adjustments. I am not a fan of quarter-over-quarter exaggerated method of measuring GDP – but my year-over-year preferred method showed moderate improvement from last quarter' [ Econintersect ]. And: 'The Federal Reserve has been notably uneasy surrounding investment levels in the economy with a prolonged series of weak releases, although the second-quarter data was revised higher. The third-quarter data will offer some limited relief over investment trends' [ Economic Calendar ]. 
Consumer Sentiment, October 2016: '[W]eakened substantially' [ Econoday ]. '[I]t was one year further back, September 2014, that the expectations component, at 76.8 this month, was this weak. Weakness here points to lack of confidence in the jobs outlook.'

'This report, which isn't raising any red flags, is closely watched by Federal Reserve policy makers who, given the strength of the labor market, are on the look out for early signs of wage-related inflation.' 
Hotels: 'On the one hand, plenty data from STR , HNN's parent company, shows that things in the United States hotel industry are slowing down. Other the other hand, we have a report that September RevPAR  ;was up 5.6%. And, yes, both are true' [ Hotel News Notes ]. 'The great performance—this was the highest RevPAR growth this year—really reminded me of the better days we have seen in the past few up cycles. Of course, the results are not actually a sign of anything but a calendar shift of the Jewish holidays Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur out of September into October. So I would strongly caution against reading anything, good or bad, into these monthly numbers.' 
Rail: 'This week the one year rolling average did not worsen – but it remains in contraction' [ Econintersect ]. 
Rail: 'Two [CSX] trains collided head-on on a stretch of track south of Philadelphia around 8:25 a.m. Friday, leaving four people injured, according to officials' (with classic photo) [ NBC Philadelphia ]. 'It was not immediately clear what caused the trains to be on the same track.'

The deal pushes UPS more deeply into jumbo-jet operations at a time when international shipping demand has been soft for many companies and populist anti-trade currents seem to present new barriers to global goods movement. The company is pressing lawmakers to support new trade agreements that are drawing scorn in the presidential campaign but would bring new freight volume for its new, bigger planes. In the meantime, UPS says cross-border e-commerce is surging six times faster than the broader economy, growth that helped the company show big gains across its business lines in the third quarter.'

ARTICLE

By Dean Baker, the co-founder of CEPR. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website 
Globalization and technology are routinely cited as drivers of inequality over the last four decades. While the relative importance of these causes is disputed, both are often viewed as natural and inevitable products of the working of the economy, rather than as the outcomes of deliberate policy. In fact, both the course of globalization and the distribution of rewards from technological innovation are very much the result of policy. Insofar as they have led to greater inequality, this has been the result of conscious policy choices. 
Starting with globalization, there was nothing pre-determined about a pattern of trade liberalization that put U.S. manufacturing workers in direct competition with their much lower paid counterparts in the developing world. Instead, that competition was the result of trade pacts written to make it as easy as possible for U.S. corporations to invest in the developing world to take advantage of lower labor costs, and then ship their products back to the United States. The predicted and actual result of this pattern of trade has been to lower wages for manufacturing workers and non-college educated workers more generally, as displaced manufacturing workers crowd into other sectors of the economy. 
Instead of only putting manufacturing workers into competition with lower-paid workers in other countries, our trade deals could have been crafted to subject doctors, dentists, lawyers and other highly-paid professionals to international competition. As it stands, almost nothing has been done to remove the protectionist barriers that allow highly-educated professionals in the United States to earn far more than their counterparts in other wealthy countries. 
This is clearest in the case of doctors. For the most part, it is impossible for foreign-trained physicians to practice in the United States unless they have completed a residency program in the United States. The number of residency slots, in turn, is strictly limited, as is the number of slots open for foreign medical students. While this is a quite blatantly protectionist restriction, it has persisted largely unquestioned through a long process of trade liberalization that has radically reduced or eliminated most of the barriers on trade in goods. The result is that doctors in the United States earn an average of more than $250,000 a year, more than twice as much as their counterparts in other wealthy countries. This costs the country roughly $100 billion a year in higher medical bills compared to a situation in which U.S. doctors received the same pay as doctors elsewhere. Economists, including trade economists, have largely chosen to ignore the barriers that sustain high professional pay at enormous economic cost. 
In addition to the items subject to trade, the overall trade balance is also very much the result of policy choices. The textbook theory has capital flowing from rich countries to poor countries, which means that rich countries run trade surpluses with poor countries. While this accurately described the pattern of trade in the 1990s up until the East Asian financial crisis (a period in which the countries of the region enjoyed very rapid growth), in the last two decades developing countries taken as a whole have been running large trade surpluses with wealthy countries. 
This implies large trade deficits in rich countries, especially the United States, which in turn has meant a further loss of manufacturing jobs with the resulting negative impact on wage inequality. However, there was nothing inevitable about the policy shifts associated with the bailout from the East Asian financial crisis that led the developing world to become a net exporter of capital. 
The pattern of gains from technology has been even more directly determined by policy than is the case with gains from trade. There has been a considerable strengthening and lengthening of patent and copyright and related protections over the last four decades. The laws have been changed to extend patents to new areas such as life forms, business methods, and software. Copyright duration has been extended from 55 years to 95 years. Perhaps even more important, the laws have become much more friendly to holders of these property claims to tilt legal proceedings in their favor, with courts becoming more patent-friendly and penalties for violations becoming harsher. And, the United States has placed stronger intellectual property (IP) rules at center of every trade agreement negotiated in the last quarter century. 
In this context, it would hardly be surprising if the development of 'technology' was causing an upward redistribution of income. The people in a position to profit from stronger IP rules are almost exclusively the highly educated and those at the top end of the income distribution. It is almost definitional that stronger IP rules will result in an upward redistribution of income. 
This upward redistribution could be justified if stronger IP rules led to more rapid productivity growth, thereby benefitting the economy as a whole. However, there is very little evidence to support that claim. Michele Boldrin and David Levine have done considerable research on this topic and generally found the opposite. My own work, using cross-country regressions with standard measures of patent strength, generally found a negative and often significant relationship between patent strength and productivity growth. 
There is also a substantial amount of money at stake. In the case of prescription drugs alone, the United States is on path to spend more than $430 billion in 2016 for drugs that would likely cost one-tenth of this amount in the absence of patent and related protections. While we do need mechanisms for financing innovation and creative work, it is almost certainly the case that patent and copyright monopolies as currently structured are not the most efficient route, even if their negative consequences for distribution are quite evident. 
The structuring of trade and rules on IP are two important ways in which policy has been designed to redistribute income upward over the last four decades. There are many other ways in which the market has been structured to disadvantage those at the middle and bottom of the income distribution, perhaps most notably macroeconomic policies that result in high unemployment. While tax and transfer policies that reduce poverty and inequality may be desirable, we should also be aware of the ways in which policy has been designed to increase inequality. It is much easier to have an economic system that produces more equality rather than one that needlessly generates inequality, which we then try to address with redistributive policies. 0 2 0 0 0 0

I just received an e-mail from AirBnB which patently violates the CAN-SPAM Act by virtue of not having an unsubscribe option. It's even cheekier for AirBnB to be contacting me since I am deeply opposed to AirBnB and have never once visited their site, and never have or would use their service, either as a lodger or a host. That means they are very likely to have violated the CAN-SPAM Act in a second manner, by virtue of having harvested my e-mail address . 
A big problem with CAN-SPAM is the only parties with a right of action are 'Internet Access Services' and not 'natural persons,' as in end recipients. 
Here are the relevant provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act per Wikipedia : 
The 3 basic types of compliance defined in the CAN-SPAM Act, unsubscribe, content and sending behavior compliance, are as follows: 
Unsubscribe compliance A visible and operable unsubscribe mechanism is present in all emails. Consumer opt-out requests are honored within 10 business days. Opt-out lists also known as Suppression lists are only used for compliance purposes. 
Content compliance Accurate 'From' lines (including 'friendly froms') Relevant subject lines (relative to offer in body content and not deceptive) A legitimate physical address of the publisher and/or advertiser is present. PO Box addresses are acceptable in compliance with 16 C.F.R. 316.2(p) and if the email is sent by a third party, the legitimate physical address of the entity, whose products or services are promoted through the email should be visible. A label is present if the content is adult. 
Sending behavior compliance A message cannot be sent through an open relay A message cannot be sent without an unsubscribe option. A message cannot be sent to a harvested email address A message cannot contain a false header A message should contain at least one sentence. A message cannot be null.

Yves here. This Real News Network segment continues its discussion of yet another acronym, TRIPS, that has much to do with how the economic playing field has been tilted against ordinary workers. Please note that the transcript below was published without apostrophes. I added them as best I could but may have missed some. 
LYNN FRIES: Welcome to The Real News Network. Im Lynn Fries in Geneva. 
This is part 5 of a series with Peter Drahos who is explaining the story of intellectual property linked to trade. 
Joining us from Australia, Peter Drahos is a Professor at the Australian National University, in the School of Regulation and Global Governance. He holds a Chair in Intellectual Property at Queen Mary, the University of London. Peter Drahos is co-author of Information Feudalism: Who Owns the Knowledge Economy? 
Welcome Peter. 
PETER DRAHOS: Thank you. 
FRIES: In Part 4 you talked about how the ownership of intellectual property rights is concentrated among very few key multinationals. And it's these incumbent players that profit from the TRIPS Agreement. In what other ways did the globalization of intellectual property rights concentrate power in the hands of these multinationals? 
DRAHOS: One of the things that's probably not fully appreciated about intellectual property rights is that they are a form of private tax. So that a patent owner or a copyright owner essentially can require a producer say in a developing country, to pay a licensing fee before they can use the relevant bit of intellectual property whether that is copying a book, making use of a film or making use of the patent. Essentially intellectual property rights are a form of private taxation on innovation which is why they should be minimized. When you globalize I intellectual property rights you essentially put in the hands of the owners of intellectual property rights a global private form of taxing power. That's a pretty big form of power. 
Now this effect people in all countries. But in developing countries the cost of textbooks for example, has a severe impact on accessibility. And of course it's not just textbooks in developing countries, students in the United States or Europe would probably be able to say a lot about the costs of textbooks they have to pay for. But chances are those students have more chances of paying for those textbooks than people in developing countries. So the basic point here is that if you globalize IPR you are in effect putting in the hands of multinational companies a form of private taxing power right across the board in relation to copyrighted goods, in relation to patented goods, in relation to trade marked goods. 
We can see that citizens essentially pay and pay again. Public taxes support a lot of research and development in US universities, European universities and Australian universities. So we have a lot of research and development that's supported through public taxes. Now a lot of that research and development ultimately ends up being patented. Now through the patent system companies can levy private taxes as I said. Intellectual property rights are a form of taxation. 
So goods that are produced or innovation that's produced at public expense is recycled through the intellectual property system and people in a sense pay the license fees, the private taxes, again. So it's a form of double payment both public taxes and private taxes. And this happens all the time. Think of for example books that are produced by university academics and those academics are paid for by tax payers. And then those books end up being published by publishers who basically collect fees from universities that use those books or parts of those books in their various courses. So the problem of copyright cartels essentially obtaining very high profits from recycling textbooks that have been produced at public expense is a very severe problem. 
FRIES: An argument in favor of globalized IPR is that it's needed for innovation. Talk about your views on that. 
DRAHOS: When we look at the history of innovation in most countries what we see is that public investment has played a hugely important role. That public institutes of research have been extremely important. Intellectual property is often confused with innovation but the explanation for innovation lies in states committing to the funding of basic research. And that's true for the United States. If we look at the history of the United States, the federal government of the United States has really played a huge role in promoting excellence in universities in funding public research. 
Now intellectual property rights have some modest role in all of this. But the problem is that theyve grown like topsy. Theyve grown out of control. These things march like Frankenstein through our economies. And that's the real problem. My argument is not that there is no role for IPR but what to be recognized is that governments have to commit to using public taxes as they have in the past to funding basic research and to funding universities. 
And one of the great dangers in relying on the intellectual property rights system is that you are actually undermining public research, the very thing that historically has given us such great innovations whether in biotechnology or whether is areas of mathematics. The contribution of public research has been so profoundly important and now we are moving into a world where there is excessive reliance on intellectual property in the mistaken belief that intellectual property somehow promotes innovation. When in many senses intellectual property or the globalization of intellectual property is actually anti-innovation. One I think has to recognize the role of public investment in innovation. 
An obsession with intellectual property rights can have unexpected repercussions on research cultures. And I think many scientists would say that the research environment in universities is profoundly different to what it was thirty or forty years ago. I mean scientists when for example when they were working on recombinant DNA technology as they were in the early 1970s publicly spoke about the dangers of recombinant DNA technology and they spoke about some of the advantages. 
They were able to do this because they were working in public institutions. And in the United States public universities drove much of the research in recombinant DNA technology. Now I think if you spoke to those researchers many of them would say that these kinds of public discussions about the direction of research are much harder for our society to have because scientists worry about undermining the validity of a patent application for example. 
FRIES: And what's the problem on relying on the international patent system? 
DRAHOS: There are many complicated problems around patents. And one of the big problems is that patents tend to serve people who can afford to pay. Now if the patented commodity is a tennis racket that's not such a big problem. But if the patented commodity is a medicine that is a big problem because patents drive up the costs of medicines. And the way that preferences are measured is through the ability to pay. 
And of course billions of people in the world do not have the ability to pay for patented medicines. So in essence the patent system is picking up the preferences of predominantly wealthy citizens which is why many diseases, tropical diseases, are essentially not researched. Because the markets in those patented medicines are not big enough. There are not enough incentives for pharmaceutical companies to enter those particular markets. So relying on the patent system to serve the entire globe, all the citizens of the world, is essentially flawed. 
FRIES: It's not hard to see the critical need for public institutes of research but they are state funded and states are collecting less taxes. Which brings us to the role of intellectual property rights in tax avoidance games. Tell us about that. 
DRAHOS: One of the issues that's confronting all countries is raising sufficient revenue. Getting companies to pay sufficient taxes. Now at an international level a perennial problem has been the issue of transfer pricing. This is basically where a large company transfers a particular asset between its subsidiaries. 
So for example, a licensing agreement in which one part of the company licenses another part of the company to produce a particular good. Now the whole idea behind transfer pricing from a companys point of view is that in those countries where the tax is high, the particular subsidiary pays the most for the license. So in other words, it can claim the biggest costs for the purposes of the taxation system in that country. Now in theory, tax departments require that companies value the transfer of assets for the purposes of transfer pricing at arms length. 
Now this can work fairly well in relation to physical goods such as factories for example, where it is reasonably easy to determine the value of what the sale of the factory really is. It is actually very difficult to value invisible, intangible property. Trying to value what a particular license, a patent license, is worth is quite a complicated problem for a tax bureaucracy. Now the transfer pricing problem has been around for decades. And tax departments all over the world have struggled with it. And it's really led to this problem of fiscal degradation. 
The taxation games that are played around intellectual property rights ultimately harm all states whether they are rich or poor. So there is a lot of concern in the United States for example that intellectual property rights are being used to shift profits by US companies out of the US tax jurisdiction. So the US Congress for example, a few years ago heard of examples of licensing agreements in which Ireland for example was used as a conduit to land profits in various tax havens whether in the Bahamas or elsewhere. So the problem of using intellectual property rights to shift profits to deprive states of a proper share of public taxes is a problem for the United States as much as it is a problem for China or for India or for Australia. 
FRIES: We are going to break and be back with Part 6. Please join us as we continue our conversation with Peter Drahos. Peter Drahos, thank you. 
DRAHOS: Thank you.

Computer seized in Weiner probe prompts FBI to take new steps in Clinton email inquiry Washington Post 
Read the letter Comey sent to FBI employees explaining his controversial decision on the Clinton email investigation Washington Post. Consistent with my pet theory that Comey was force to get out in front of this development due to the odds of staff insurrection in the form of leaks. From Lambert via e-mail: 
By Comey's own words under oath in July, there must have been 'new and substantial information.' So unless Comey is committing perjury, which the Clinton campaign has not, so far, claimed, this is not a nothingburger, by definition. 
So that must have been quite some 'briefing.' 
Also: 'Yesterday, the investigative team briefed me on their recommendation with respect to seeking access to emails that have recently been found in an unrelated case. Because those emails appear to be pertinent to our investigation, I agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review them.' 
So there's a process, it doubtless takes more than a week, and therefore the Clinton campaign's talking point of 'We don't know what's there, so release it all for the sake of the American people' is bullshit, even if you leave out that the emails can't be released without vetting them for classified information. 
Also, if it's really nasty, do the people the Democrats encouraged to vote early get a Mulligan? 
Clinton urges FBI to explain renewed email inquiry 'without delay' Washington Post. As if the FBI has to explain itself to her? 
Democrats turn on Comey after he reopens Clinton email wound Politico. How fickle of them. He was their statesman just a few weeks ago…My guess is that Comey told Congress because so many agents in the FBI were unhappy about how the earlier probe had been handled and the the news of the latest batch of e-mails was already all over the FIB (a Freudian typo). Thus Comey felt he had to go public, since it would otherwise be leaked and he judged that to be worse (imagine the wrath of the Republican Congresscritters)

Proposed pipeline routes through the Middle East to gas markets in Europe. The purple line is the Western-supported Qatar-Turkey pipeline. All of the nations it passes through — Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Turkey (all highlighted in red) — have agreed to it … except Syria. The red line is the 'Islamic Pipeline' from Iran through Iraq into Syria. See text below for further explanation. (Source: MintPress News ; click to enlarge) 
Summary first: We have been at war in Syria over pipelines since 1949. This is just the next mad phase. 
I'm not sure most Americans have figured out what's happening in Syria, because so much of what we hear is confusing to us, and really, we know so little of the context for it. Is it an insurgency against a brutal ruler? Is it a group of insurgencies struggling for power in a nearly failed state? Is it a proxy war expressing the territorial and ideological interests of the U.S., Russia, Turkey and Iran? 
Or something else? 
According to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. it is something else — a war between competing national interests to build, or not build, a pipeline to the Mediterranean so natural gas can be exported to Europe. Inconveniently for Syria, that nation lies along an obvious pipeline route. 
Which makes it another war between interests for money — something not very hard to understand at all. 
Here's Kennedy's argument via EcoWatch. This is a long piece, well worth a full read, but I'll try to present just the relevant sections here. 
The Historical Context: Decades of CIA-Sponsored Coups and Counter-Coups in Syria 
Kennedy's introductory section contains an excellent examination of the history of U.S. involvement in Syria starting in the 1950s with the Cold War machinations of the Eisenhower-appointed Dulles brothers, John Foster Dulles, the Secretary of State, and Allen Dulles, the head of the CIA. Together, they effectively ruled U.S. foreign policy. 
Kennedy writes (my emphasis): 
Syria: Another Pipeline War 
… America's unsavory record of violent interventions in Syria—obscure to the American people yet well known to Syrians —sowed fertile ground for the violent Islamic Jihadism that now complicates any effective response by our government to address the challenge of ISIS. So long as the American public and policymakers are unaware of this past, further interventions are likely to only compound the crisis. Moreover, our enemies delight in our ignorance. 
… [W]e need to look at history from the Syrians' perspective and particularly the seeds of the current conflict. Long before our 2003 occupation of Iraq triggered the Sunni uprising that has now morphed into the Islamic State, the CIA had nurtured violent Jihadism as a Cold War weapon and freighted U.S./Syrian relationships with toxic baggage. 
During the 1950's, President Eisenhower and the Dulles brothers rebuffed Soviet treaty proposals to leave the Middle East a cold war neutral zone and let Arabs rule Arabia. Instead, they mounted a clandestine war against Arab Nationalism—which CIA Director Allan [sic] Dulles equated with communism—particularly when Arab self-rule threatened oil concessions. They pumped secret American military aid to tyrants in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon favoring puppets with conservative Jihadist ideologies which they regarded as a reliable antidote to Soviet Marxism. At a White House meeting between the CIA's Director of Plans, Frank Wisner, and Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, in September of 1957, Eisenhower advised the agency, 'We should do everything possible to stress the 'holy war' aspect.' 
The CIA began its active meddling in Syria in 1949 —barely a year after the agency's creation. Syrian patriots had declared war on the Nazis, expelled their Vichy French colonial rulers and crafted a fragile secularist democracy based on the American model. But in March of 1949, Syria's democratically elected president, Shukri-al-Kuwaiti, hesitated to approve the Trans Arabian Pipeline, an American project intended to connect the oil fields of Saudi Arabia to the ports of Lebanon via Syria. In his book, Legacy of Ashes , CIA historian Tim Weiner recounts that in retaliation, the CIA engineered a coup , replacing al-Kuwaiti with the CIA's handpicked dictator , a convicted swindler named Husni al-Za'im. Al-Za'im barely had time to dissolve parliament and approve the American pipeline before his countrymen deposed him , 14 weeks into his regime. 
Kennedy then details the history of coups and counter-coups in and against Syria, and concludes this section with this: 
Thanks in large part to Allan Dulles and the CIA, whose foreign policy intrigues were often directly at odds with the stated policies of our nation, the idealistic path outlined in the Atlantic Charter was the road not taken. In 1957, my grandfather, Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy, sat on a secret committee charged with investigating CIA's clandestine mischief in the Mid-East . The so called 'Bruce Lovett Report,' to which he was a signatory, described CIA coup plots in Jordan, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Egypt, all common knowledge on the Arab street, but virtually unknown to the American people who believed, at face value, their government's denials. 
The report blamed the CIA for the rampant anti-Americanism that was then mysteriously taking root 'in the many countries in the world today.'… A parade of Iranian and Syrian dictators, including Bashar al-Assad and his father , have invoked the history of the CIA's bloody coups as a pretext for their authoritarian rule, repressive tactics and their need for a strong Russian alliance. These stories are therefore well known to the people of Syria and Iran who naturally interpret talk of U.S. intervention in the context of that history. 
While the compliant American press parrots the narrative that our military support for the Syrian insurgency is purely humanitarian, many Syrians see the present crisis as just another proxy war over pipelines and geopolitics. Before rushing deeper into the conflagration, it would be wise for us to consider the abundant facts supporting that perspective. 
So much for our supposed interest in 'humanitarian' intervention in Syria. From a Syrian point of view, it has never been thus. It has been about pipelines since 1949, and they understand that, even if we don't. 
The Current Conflagration 
Kennedy then turns to the present, or the near-present. Refer to the map above as you read: 
A Pipeline War 
In [the Syrians'] view, our war against Bashar Assad did not begin with the peaceful civil protests of the Arab Spring in 2011. Instead it began in 2000 when Qatar proposed to construct a $10 billion, 1,500km pipeline through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and Turkey . 
Qatar shares with Iran, the South Pars/North Dome gas field, the world's richest natural gas repository. The international trade embargo, until recently, prohibited Iran from selling gas abroad and ensured that Qatar's gas could only reach European markets if it is liquefied and shipped by sea, a route that restricts volume and dramatically raises costs. 
The EU, which gets 30 percent of its gas from Russia, was equally hungry for the pipeline which would have given its members cheap energy and relief from Vladimir Putin's stifling economic and political leverage. Turkey, Russia's second largest gas customer, was particularly anxious to end its reliance on its ancient rival and to position itself as the lucrative transect hub for Asian fuels to EU markets. The Qatari pipeline would have benefited Saudi Arabia's conservative Sunni Monarchy by giving them a foothold in Shia dominated Syria. 
The Saudi's geopolitical goal is to contain the economic and political power of the Kingdom's principal rival, Iran , a Shiite state, and close ally of Bashar Assad. The Saudi monarchy viewed the U.S. sponsored Shia takeover in Iraq as a demotion to its regional power and was already engaged in a proxy war against Tehran in Yemen, highlighted by the Saudi genocide against the Iranian backed Houthi tribe. 
Which puts the Qatari pipeline squarely opposite to Russia's national interest — natural gas (methane) sales to Europe. 
Of course, the Russians, who sell 70 percent of their gas exports to Europe, viewed the Qatar/Turkey pipeline as an existential threat. In Putin's view, the Qatar pipeline is a NATO plot to change the status quo, deprive Russia of its only foothold in the Middle East, strangle the Russian economy and end Russian leverage in the European energy market. In 2009, Assad announced that he would refuse to sign the agreement to allow the pipeline to run through Syria 'to protect the interests of our Russian ally.' 
That was likely the last straw vis-à-vis the U.S. Which brings us to another pipeline, the so-called 'Islamic Pipeline' (see map above): 
'Assad further enraged the Gulf's Sunni monarchs by endorsing a Russian approved 'Islamic pipeline' running from Iran's side of the gas field through Syria and to the ports of Lebanon. The Islamic pipeline would make Shia Iran instead of Sunni Qatar, the principal supplier to the European energy market and dramatically increase Tehran's influence in the Mid-East and the world. Israel also was understandably determined to derail the Islamic pipeline which would enrich Iran and Syria and presumably strengthen their proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas. 
Another, competing pipeline which would run through Syrian territory, but this time carrying Iranian gas instead of Qatari gas. Thus the demonizing of Assad as evil in the mold of Saddam Hussein, instead of just a run-of-the-mill Middle East autocrat, as bad as some but better than others. Kennedy includes a good section on the history of the al-Assad family's rule of Syria, including this information from top reporters Sy Hersh and Robert Parry: 
According to Hersh, 'He certainly wasn't beheading people every Wednesday like the Saudis do in Mecca.' Another veteran journalist, Bob Parry, echoes that assessment. 'No one in the region has clean hands but in the realms of torture, mass killings, civil liberties and supporting terrorism, Assad is much better than the Saudis.' 
In September 2013, the Sunni states involved in the Qatar-Turkey pipeline were so determined to remove Syrian opposition to the pipeline that they offered, via John Kerry, to carry the whole cost of an U.S. invasion to topple al-Assad. 
Kerry reiterated the offer to Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL27): 'With respect to Arab countries offering to bear the costs of [an American invasion] to topple Assad, the answer is profoundly Yes, they have. The offer is on the table.' 
Obama's response: 
Despite pressure from Republicans, Barrack Obama balked at hiring out young Americans to die as mercenaries for a pipeline conglomerate . Obama wisely ignored Republican clamoring to put ground troops in Syria or to funnel more funding to 'moderate insurgents.' But by late 2011, Republican pressure and our Sunni allies had pushed the American government into the fray. 
The rest is a history of provocation and over-reaction — a great deal of both — and chaos and death in Syria. Kennedy provides much detail here, at one point adding: 
[Syria's] moderates are fleeing a war that is not their war . They simply want to escape being crushed between the anvil of Assad's Russian backed tyranny and the vicious Jihadi Sunni hammer that we had a hand in wielding in a global battle over competing pipelines . You can't blame the Syrian people for not widely embracing a blueprint for their nation minted in either Washington or Moscow. The super powers have left no options for an idealistic future that moderate Syrians might consider fighting for. And no one wants to die for a pipeline. 
I'll leave it there, but again, do read the entire piece if you want to truly understand what's going on in Syria, and what is about to go on. 
Bottom Line 
Bottom line, it's as Kennedy said: 'No one wants to die for a pipeline'… but many do and will. 
I'll offer three thoughts. One , if we weren't so determined to be deeply dependent on fossil fuels, this would be their war, not ours. Two , we are deeply dependent on fossil fuels because of the political machinations of the oil companies, their CEOs, and the banks and hedge funds who fund them, all of whom pay our government officials — via campaign contributions and the revolving door — to prolong that dependence. We're here because the holders of big oil money want us here. 
And three , keep all this in mind during the term of the next president. It will help you make sense of the phony warrior- cum -humanitarian arguments we're almost certain to be subjected to. 
We have been at war in Syria over pipelines since 1949. This is just the next mad phase. 0 0 0 0 1 1

Why, it's almost like they think there's a 'surprise' out there that might change people's minds….

By Lambert Strether of Corrente . 
The FT's Izabella Kaminska (' The autoignition temperature of manual cars is much higher than Fahrenheit 451 ') brings McKinsey's report on self-driving cars to our attention ('An Integrated Perspective on the Future of Mobility,' PDF ). Bloomberg, writing on the report , put the key fact-like price comparison in the deck: 
Autonomous taxis one-quarter the price of New York cab ride 
And then quoted the following eye-popping fact-like dollars-and-cents figure: 
The self-driving vehicles being pioneered by Tesla Motors Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and others are poised to dramatically lower the cost of taxis, potentially making them cheaper than buses or subways, according to a joint report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance and McKinsey & Co. Having no driver to pay could reduce taxi prices to 67 cents a mile by 2025 , less than a quarter of the cost in Manhattan today, the report found. 
(The word 'could' seems to be doing rather a lot of work in the second sentence.) But how were those figures 'found'? On what basis did McKinsey, the 'the trusted advisor and counselor to many of the world's most influential businesses and institutions' , come to its conclusions? 
And here, readers, I went wrong. I thought I would try to understand the business ratios and income statements of today's taxi industry ( NAICS code 4853 ; income statement from Yellow Cab of Missoula, MT[ 1]) and use those as a baseline to evaluate McKinsey's analysis. That was a time-consuming mistake, and here is why. 
Let's look at the report, starting by having searched the PDF on '67.' Here is the source for Bloomberg's quote, Exhibit 10: 
I've helpfully highlighted the '67'; interestingly, a PDF search reveals that this is the only place where '67' appears. There is, for example, no table or equation showing the calculations through which McKinsey arrived at that figure.[2] Nevertheless, we look for some explanation, and the best I can find is in the text adjacent to Exhibit 10, on pages 23 and 25. (I've pasted a snippet from page 23 in at the top of page 25, and helpfully highlighted some of the text, and footnote 17): 
Now, the $0.67 figure in Exhibit 10 applies only to the case of an 'individual use' self-driving taxi (the chart says 'self-driven,' but the caption is correct). That is, Jane Coder calls up a self-driving taxi to get to work, and when she's done with her commute, the freed-up taxi responds to a call from Joe Coder to go home, and so on. The taxi is not shared. This use case is described in the paragraph marked '[1]'. Here is that paragraph: 
For many drivers ride-hailing would nonetheless become the economic alternative. An on-demand, self-driving vehicle could also replace most current shared-mobility business models such as car sharing, carpooling, and ride-hailing: it could drive itself to the next customer, to a designated parking space, or back to the point of origin. 
Do you see any calculations there — indeed, any numbers at all — that would justify the $0.67 figure? No? (Notice also that 'could' and 'would' are working hard in this paragraph, too.) 
We move on to the paragraph marked [2]: 
If a private consumer were open to sharing a ride with another traveler, the economics become even more attractive: on average, using a self-driving, electric, pooled taxi could be 30–60 percent cheaper per mile than a private vehicle, depending on the number of people sharing the ride. By 2025, a private car would cost $0.43/mile, whereas a consumer could use a self-driving, pooled taxi for as little as $0.17/mile–$0.29/mile 17 . 
Here at least we see claims with numbers in them, but none of them are relevant to the 'individual use self-driving taxi' case, and so the $0.67 figure remains a mystery, as yet unexplained. We move on to the paragraph marked [3]: 
Compared with public transport, it appears that in various US cities public transport remains about as twice as cheap as human-driven taxi pooling with a cost of $0.64/mile in 2015. 
The same applies; the $0.67 figure remains inexplicable. But wait! There's that footnote 17 in the paragraph marked '[2]': 
Costs are estimated the total cost of ownership, assuming 70,000 miles driven annually[3], average driver salaries, 10 percent overhead costs and a 10 percent required rate of return on invested capital for the fleet operator. We assume a utilization factor of 50 percent for taxis and 70 percent for pooled cars. This does not take into account a price premium for any additional journey time required to pick up multiple passengers. 
(I've helpfully underlined the weasel words, along with words that make me ask 'How do you know that?') Do you see a source for any of this? No? Why would that be? (Contrast footnote 17, in the left column, to footnotes 18, 19, and 20 in the right column, all of which provide sources. 
Wishing to give McKinsey the benefit of the doubt, I looked for their editorial policies, which I found on page 64, on the About page. In relevant part: 
So this really is the best part, isn't it? 
The information contained in this publication is derived from carefully selected sources we believe are reasonable. 
Well, I should hope so! ('Trusted advisor and counsellor,' et cetera et cetera.) So that's alright then! Although one could wish that the 'reasonable' and 'carefully selected' sources were named.[4] 
* * * 
So, I've managed to emulate the classic bad New Yorker article; I followed the ornithologists into the swamp, because when they said they heard the call of a rare bird, I believed them. But they didn't find the bird! So, we still don't know where McKinsey got its sixty-seven cents ($0.67) a mile figure for its 'self-driving taxi' use case. (What the Bloomberg reporter thought they were doing when they repeated it is another question.) And we don't know know why its 'report' didn't provide an explanation for it. Explanations that occur to me: 
1. An editorial disaster . Nobody checked footnote 17 to add the sourcing the for sixty-seven cents ($0.67) a mile figure. This strikes me as unlikely, given the level of attention given to the reports design. 
2. A public relations scam . McKinsey simply made up the sixty-seven cents ($0.67) a mile figure out of whole cloth. This strikes me as unlikely, given the whole 'trusted advisor' schtick. 
3. A bait and switch . The source of the calculations for sixty-seven cents ($0.67) a mile figure is internal and proprietary, and McKinsey won't reveal anything until you engage them. This strikes me as unlikely, dittoez. 
'Tis a puzzlement! 
NOTES 
[1] I don't want to whinge about this, but when I was a sprat, twenty years ago, and I wanted industry ratios and company reports, I'd go down to the Boston Public Library's Business Branch , display my library card, and get the information for free . Google was awfully good at displaying results from 'industry research' firms that demand a fee , but not so good with, er, 'free stuff.' Am I looking for stats in all the wrong places? 
[2] Why 67? Why not 65? Or 70? I'd hate to think McKinsey guilty of spurious precision. 
[3] New York's Taxicab Factbook estimates that the average cab travels 70,000 miles per year. 
[4] There's also 'We do not guarantee its accuracy or completeness and nothing in this document shall be construed to be a representation of such a guarantee,' but I assume Bud from Legal insisted that go in, and I don't hold it against them. 
APPENDIX 
I like this too. From page 49: 
And the text: 
Within the mobility sector itself, an on-demand self-driving taxi could replace most current shared-mobility business models. Adding a self-driving component to car-sharing operations, ridehailing services, and taxi services makes the business models indistinguishable. 
Indeed it 'could'! Exactly in the way the wizards of Unseen University nailing magic broomsticks under Sam Vimes's horse-drawn coach made it 'indistinguishable' from an airborne, supersonic vehicle! 0 0 0 0 0 0

ARTICLE

by Outis Philalithopoulos The following series is a work of fiction. Any resemblance of characters in the story to people in real life is entirely intentional, and their dialogue is typically cut, with only insignificant modifications, from books, articles, or interviews. When substantive remarks derive from a source not mentioned explicitly in the text, the source is described at the end of the episode in which they appear. By Outis Philalithopoulos, who met an untimely end five years ago, and now 'wears the chains he forged in life' as an economist. I had imagined that this new existence would be like working for the NSA, with official clearance to watch over my loved ones and enemies. But I continue to see through a glass darkly – mostly only confused impressions, and recently a sense of impending doom lying heavily upon the United States. Once in a while, though, clearer images slip through the veil, like letters washing up on the woeful banks of the Acheron. So it was that I found myself perusing a February article by philosopher John Holbo in the influential blog Crooked Timber. He began with a question that got my attention: What is liberalism? What is conservatism? Then he noted: If you are interested in getting answers to these questions, you (probably) want the answers to do two things for you: 1) Give you the best possible version of this thing. What is the best liberalism/conservatism could be, as political philosophy? […] 2) Give you insight into what's going on in real politics. What constructions of liberalism/conservatism, as philosophies, give me the best handle on what's going on in the US election cycle, say? Holbo pointed out that #1 and #2 are not the same thing, and trying to do both at once creates confusion. For example: Suppose you think the best, most defensible philosophical conservatism would be G.A. Cohen's conservatism . Intellectually, that might be rather fine, yet useless for getting a grip on real U.S. politics. You can't make sense of the Republican candidate line-up by measuring relative degrees of departure from what [Cohen] thinks conservatism ought to be. True, I thought to myself, conservatives don't measure up to their ideals. Fortunately, describing people like me – liberals, progressives, the Left, whatever you want to call us – is easier. Corey Robin gave a straightforward definition in his 2011 The Reactionary Mind , Since the modern era began, men and women in subordinate positions have marched against their superiors in the state, church, workplace, and other hierarchical institutions. They have gathered under different banners – the labor movement, feminism, abolition, socialism – and shouted different slogans: freedom, equality, rights, democracy, revolution. Then I had a disturbing thought. Isn't Robin's definition a textbook example of #1? It is 'the best, most defensible' idea of what liberalism could be: a patchwork of causes throughout history that in retrospect I want to identify with, while leaving on the cutting floor everything else that has called itself 'Left.' What would happen if someone were to define us progressives by #2? By our actions and our actual effects upon the world, and not by our language or our ideals? Was that where Holbo was going? I braced myself as I continued to read the article. But I reached the end, and after flipping through the 207 comments by what seemed to be mostly university faculty, I relaxed. While considerable effort had gone into attempts to define the unattractive, non-ideal reality of conservativism, the only new definition of liberalism offered was: To me being left wing means not killing (lots of brown) people, being critical of power and authority and trying not to be a (selfish) dick. Sounded good to me. Clearly most of these well-educated people agreed that Robin's definition was basically correct, with real life only slightly messier than the ideal. Maybe for liberalism, #1 and #2 are more or less the same thing. Then again, I thought with a twinge of unease, they are mostly liberals like me. Maybe I should seek what might be painful truths. I had an idea about where to start looking, and I flitted up a shadowy hill, where there huddled a bespectacled spirit with hunched shoulders. 'Allan,' I began. Allan Bloom squinted at me. 'Do I have the pleasure of meeting a fellow elitist?' 'What?' I asked, startled. 'No, I was hoping you could tell me why liberalism is evil.' He chuckled. 'Don't hold back,' I implored him. 'I can handle the truth.' 'A corrosive ideology has taken over the American mind,' he began. 'By now, almost everyone, especially in the universities, believes that truth is relative. They treat this relativity as a moral postulate, as the condition of a free society. To them, the real danger is people who think they are right, and the solution is not to correct mistakes and really become right – it is not to think you are right at all. The Left of today does not believe in itself or in what it does.' 'Thank you, sir,' I said, bowing, and went to ponder his words. It was exciting to think of myself in Bloom's terms. Was I one molecule of a transhistorical acid that was eating away at all truth in the world? I thought about myself and my Left-oriented friends. Did we believe that sexual repression, the Iraq War, overt and subtle racism, anti-immigrant bias, and gender stereotyping were absolutely wrong? Yes. Did we believe in ourselves? Of course. With relief but also a hint of disappointment, I concluded that even the brilliant Bloom had not succeeded in painting a convincing portrait of what, if anything, was evil about liberalism. Back to Robin's definition, I thought to myself, and there things would have ended if not for… 'OUTIS!' bellowed a voice. I whirled around. 'Polyphemus,' I said uncomfortably. 'I thought we had agreed that I had nothing to do with that burning stake…' 'NO!' interrupted the Cyclops. 'I come here for YOU, not the accursed son of Laertes. I have a QUESTION!' 'Yes?' I asked. 'You have thought a little about your identy, o No-Name, and what it means to be a liberal. But what if being a liberal means neither being the leaven of the world, nor yetbeing a dark agent of the Apocalypse?' 'What do you mean?' I said quickly. 'What if 21st century liberal culture is simply one society that happens to be influential in this time and place? A culture in which idealism and grandeur are mixed with wretchedness and compromises and contradiction? One that does not stand astride history but has been produced by history and has not escaped it? What if, in a word, it is a culture like other cultures?' 'Ridiculous!' I burst out. 'You're saying there's no difference between us and the ancient Greeks, who had slavery? Or the 19th century British Empire, whose missionaries laid waste to India? Or the Eskimos, who had rigidly defined sex roles that oppressed women?' 'Console yourself with these facile mantras,' sneered Polyphemus. ' You are the only one of us to speak of sameness.' 'Of course I understand that liberal culture of today has a history,' I muttered. 'Of course I don't think we are some sort of elect, better than all other cultures that have other lived, except of course…' I stopped. Polyphemus laughed. 'You are a droll one, doughty Outis,' he remarked. 'If Bloom had made a more persuasive case that progressivism were a monstrous contagion destroying all that is good, you could have accepted it. What you cannot accept is that it might be human.' 'I can accept anything!' I snapped. 'Really?' The Cyclops looked at me skeptically. I nodded. 'Very well,' Polyphemus. 'If you truly wish it, a path will be provided that you can tread, seeking whatever truth you may. You will be haunted tonight by three spirits.' * * * In the next episode, Outis meets a Spirit whom he fails to recognize, and travels back into the past of liberalism.

by Lambert Strether 
Lambert here: John LeCarré, contemporary historian. 
By John Helmer , the longest continuously serving foreign correspondent in Russia, and the only western journalist to direct his own bureau independent of single national or commercial ties. Helmer has also been a professor of political science, and an advisor to government heads in Greece, the United States, and Asia. He is the first and only member of a US presidential administration (Jimmy Carter) to establish himself in Russia. Originally published at Dances with Bears 
In the first tale of the thieves' picnic, published by Leslie Charteris in 1937,a gang of robbers, kidnappers, and smugglers starts to fall apart over a $2 million lottery ticket one of the thieves stole from the gang's pot. The detective who recovers the ticket, and rescues a diamond-cutter who'd been abducted for the gang's diamond-smuggling operation, rolls up the crimes by pretending to be a gangster himself, and encouraging the others to betray each other. 
By the standards of Ilya Yurov and Benedict Worsley, the original thieves' picnic was a fight over peanuts. Yurov, the control shareholder of Trust Bank, managed the disappearance of $3.3 billion in Trust Bank funds until December 2014, when the Central Bank stopped his operations, and financed Otkritie Bank to take over in his place. Within weeks, Russian government investigators found the gap between Trust's assets and liabilities had jumped from Rb67.8 billion to Rb114 billion; in pre-devaluation terms, that's from $2 billion to $3.3 billion — bigger larcenies than the previous records set by Sergei Pugachev at Mezhprombank and Andrei Borodin at Bank of Moscow . 
Worsley had helped Yurov by operating hundreds of offshore companies and bank accounts through which the money was moved, mostly as sham loans. Yurov is now living in Kent as a guest of the British government. Worsley, who divides his time between Cyprus and Dubai, is now employed by Otkritie Bank, Trust's new owner. Worsley is being paid $32,500 per month as an informer, with a promise of a bounty of up to 4% of the recovery value of the assets Yurov and he allegedly stole and laundered, plus an indemnity from prosecution. The Worsley arrangement was kept secret by Otkritie Bank until revealed recently in the High Court in London. 
The informer reward deal is unprecedented in the history of Russian bank fraud, according to London bankers and lawyers. 'In a multi-billion fraud of this size,' said one international bank source, 'a deal like this can be justified if the recovery is large enough – that is, if Otkritie Bank and the Russian Deposit Insurance Agency couldn't follow the money trail without the informer, and if they manage to recover significantly more than they pay out to the informer. But why has Otkritie tried to keep the deal secret? The court papers show that $3.3 billion is missing from Trust Bank; Yurov's bank accounts and assets add up to $830 million. How much is Worsley holding back? Does he stand to get richer with the Otkritie deal than he got with Yurov?'Ben Worsley, according to London sources, is about 50 years of age, with a round head, bald pate, dark-rimmed glasses, an uncanny resemblance to the actor Alex Guinness (right) — and a severe allergy to being photographed. In 2014 a videotape of him surfaced on the internet, filmed secretly by a disgruntled employee at a palatial estate near Montpellier, in the south of France. Worsley claimed the house belonged to 'a Russian banker', but he lived in it as if it were his own. All traces of the videotape, and of photographs of Worsley, have disappeared. 
Once employed in Moscow by Mikhail Fridman's Alfa banking group, Worsley became acquainted with one of Alfa's inter-bank clients, Trust Bank. This had been taken over by Yurov and his associates from Mikhail Khodorkovsky, after the latter took what Yurov has subsequently claimed to have been $300 million out of the bank's capital. High Court papers presented by Otkritie Bank, as well as a recent interview Yurov has given to a Moscow newspaper, document the role Yurov hired Worsley to play for him and for Trust Bank in Cyprus. 
Ruling this past July 28 to uphold a freeze order over $830 million in Yurov's Swiss and other bank accounts and his UK home, Justice Sir Stephen Males (right) said Worsley 'had first-hand, contemporaneous interaction with [the Trust shareholders] and was involved in setting up their network of secret companies. The claims are based in large part on documentary evidence of the terms and (non-) performance of the loans, and the connections between the borrowers and [the shareholders] exposed by Mr Worsley (and supported at least in part by the documents he has provided, including the various trustees and shareholding documents.' The evidence, according to Males, was that in May 2015 Worsley had still been working with Yurov, when the two of them were negotiating with Otkritie for the return of the bank's money. 
Six months later, Worsley had changed sides. On November 17, 2015 — Males confirmed the court was subsequently told by Otkritie Bank – an agreement was signed with Worsley to trace money through the offshore companies he had managed and controlled. 'In return, Trust Bank [Otkritie Bank] has agreed to pay a monthly retainer to Mr Worsley of US $32,500 and to indemnify him against any claims that may be made against him by third parties (including [the shareholders]) in relation to any new instructions (but not for acts that happened in the past). Mr Worsley also agreed to provide a witness statement setting out truthfully his dealings with [the shareholders] and Trust Bank.' 
The judge said he is not sure whether a commission of between 1.5% and 4% of the 'net value of certain assets recovered' was part of the Worsley deal. Otkritie has sought no freeze over Worsley's bank accounts or property; there are no criminal charges against Worsley in the Russian, Swiss, British or Cypriot courts. How much Worsley may have concealed from Yurov in order to benefit himself the judge didn't venture to guess. 
Males has written that he is sure Worsley has received from the bank a pledge not to prosecute him for what he had done, and to pay his legal fees if someone else prosecutes. 'The agreement also includes (i) a release of any claims by the bank, (ii) a promise by the bank to provide support and assistance in any proceedings against Mr Worsley relating to his past conduct and to consider providing an indemnity, and (iii) a promise to tell any prosecutor or other authority that any claims which the bank may have against Mr Worsley have been amicably resolved and that the bank does not wish to pursue any prosecution or complaint against him.' 
Yurov (right) has responded that Worsley is a turmcoat who is being paid to testify falsely against him. Yurov has defended himself in court and in the Moscow press by suggesting Otkritie had kept its deal with Worsley secret to protect Worsley's share of the assets, along with other beneficiaries. Yurov says he had instructed Worsley to trace the funds owed to the bank; and that Worsley is now lying to save himself. How much money was lost through companies Yurov didn't know, and through transactions Worsley decided in his stead, is yet to be tested in court. That's when the thieves' picnic will be clearer to all. 
The High Court record reveals that Otkritie and the judge agree with Yurov that not all of the Trust Bank losses went to benefit Yurov or his associates. There had been, according to Males, 'transactions of immense complexity which give rise to what appears to be a strong inference of money laundering and the siphoning off of at least some funds to the shareholders' personal accounts. Nevertheless, the bank did make clear when applying for the freezing order that its case was that although some substantial sums had been misappropriated to the shareholders' personal use, this did not apply to all or even most of the funds which were the subject of improper loans.' 
The judge continued by quoting from testimony given by Dmitry Popkov (right) , currently deputy chief executive of Otkritie Bank and a director on the new Trust Bank board. 'Thus Mr Popkov said that: ‘It is not Trust Bank's case that the entire US $830 million lost by Trust Bank was stolen by [the shareholders] or their personal benefit. The losses were caused by a combination of [the shareholders] misappropriating money by channelling into their own projects; their paying off other bad loans, including to their companies; and misconduct by [the shareholders] over many years. It is also likely that the losses have been exacerbated by the deterioration of the Russian real estate market and the contraction of the Russian economy due to international sanctions and the drop in oil prices, coupled with the dramatic devaluation of the rouble.'' 
The judge ruled 'the decision [by Otkritie] not to disclose the Settlement Agreement [with Worsley] was clearly deliberate.' But Males decided to dismiss Yurov's appeal to lift the freeze on his cash and property because 'although Mr Worsley's evidence (and therefore his credibility) may prove to be important, I doubt whether it will be critical…. Mr Worsley's primary importance to the bank is likely to be as a source of documents, including documents signed by the shareholders themselves which appear to confirm their ultimate beneficial ownership of the offshore companies which the defendant now says were in fact beneficially owned by the bank.' 
For details of the offshore company scheme which Worsley ran for Yurov, read this . At the time of that report, on November 5, 2015 — ten days before Worsley finalized his deal with Otkritie — the bank's spokesmen Alexander Dmitriev and Maria Gurevich were asked what they knew of Worsley's role. 'Do most or all the offshore companies on record as having received loans from Trust have a common management address in Cyprus? Can you confirm that most or all the offshore companies with loan and brokerage accounts at Trust were signed by a single person, Ben Worsley, or by authorized subordinates employed by Ledra Management or Teos Management?' 
Otkritie's spokesmen refused to say. 'We are not disclosing details that may influence the judicial proceedings.' 
The reference to Ledra is to an offshore entity operating group in Cyprus called Ledra Management. This is owned and run by Christodoulos Vassiliades, a Cypriot lawyer, whose law firm has its headquarters at Ledra House in Nicosia. In the proceedings so far, Vassiliades is not identified nor accused of any wrongdoing. He has declined the invitation to clarify the role his law firm or Ledra Management played in Trust Bank's operations under Yurov. 
Teos Management is one of the companies Worsley created in Cyprus. Cyprus company records show he has been managing director of the firm since it was set up in August of 2013. Last November Worsley was contacted at the Teos office in Nicosia and asked to clarify his relationship with Yurov and Trust Bank. Worsley was travelling, according to his secretary. He did not respond to telephone calls and emails. 
On October 3, 2016, the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySec) issued a notice revealing that in September it had reviewed a case against Teos for failing to 'appoint… a compliance officer with the prior approval of the CySEC from September 2015 to 22.03.2016'. This was a serious offence, the regulator claimed . But there were mitigating factors – there had been no prior offence by Teos; and the company had already notifed CySec it was going out of business. A fine of €5.000 was imposed. 
The telephone number at Teos is now disconnected. Emails have been directed to Worsley at Teos, asking him for his comment on the terms of the Otkritie agreement and Yurov's counter-allegations. The emails are returned with a notice that they have been blocked by the Teos server. 
Worsley is playing 'a masterful game', observers in London and Nicosia say. 'While Yurov & Co. came up with the scheme to do what they claim they had to do,' claims one of the sources, 'I suspect the mastermind of the offshore schemes was Ben Worsley. Yurov may have stolen a few tens of millions, but a lot more has gone missing. Yurov claims he is notthe beneficiary of many of these companies. He probably is not. Beneficial ownership was also in hands of Worsley. He claims now that in all those beneficial ownerships he was a nominee or trustee of Yurov. I suspect that is not quite the case.' 
Asked this week to clarify why the bank tried to keep the Worsley deal secret from the London court, Otkritie has not replied by press time. 0 0 0 0 1 0

If the number one priority of the university nomenklatura had in fact been the prevention of sexual assault, they wouldn't have been running courses on microaggression . They'd have been cracking down on today's drinking culture, the venues where that culture is enacted (often fraternities), and they'd be empowering women with self-defense courses (which would give them a life-long skill). But that would have involved cracking down on powerful on-campus actors (fraternity alumni and legacies, ka-ching), powerful off-campus local actors (liquor stores and bars, ka-ching), might have led to difficulties with admissions numbers (ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching) since by now students expect to 'party'— not a verb when I was a mere sprat — and, most importantly of all, would have prevented the formation of Deans of Microaggression, Departments of Microaggression, and an entire academic circuit devoted to microaggression studies, including journals, conferences, and books. I mean, (cishet) guys, if she's not drunk and/or she's ready, willing, and able to kick you in the nuts, then the whole 'No means 'no'' semantic foofraw gets a whole lot simpler, does it not?

No matter how bad things are at CalPERS, the giant pension fund seems determined to make them worse. 
This Thursday, November 3, the California State Personnel Board is set to approve changes to the job description of CalPERS' Chief Actuary that are depicted as minor but are anything but. We get to the CalPERS job description shortly, but as Purdue's mathematics department describes the terrain : 
An actuary is a business professional who analyzes the financial consequences of risk. Actuaries use mathematics, statistics, and financial theory to study uncertain future events, especially those of concern to insurance and pension programs. 
The proposed changes both amount to a violation of the California Constitution by attempting to end the required role of the board in policy-making, and separately so far reducing the minimum qualifications for the job that they will be lower than that for the most junior actuaries now employed at CalPERS. Needless to say, that makes a mockery of the claim that CalPERS needs to dumb down the job description so severely to fill the post. CalPERS could promote someone from inside by relaxing the requirements less or not at all. 
One has to assume that the motivation for allowing a person who would be deemed to be grossly unqualified under current rules to be hired in the Chief Actuary is that the new CEO, Marcie Frost, has someone specific she'd like to bring in. The fact that Frost herself does not have a college degree and certainly does not have the mathematical chops to evaluate an actuary's professional competence certainly looks like she is giving personal loyalty far too much weight in a role where analytical rigor and professionalism are of paramount importance. 
This move troublingly resembles CalPERS' decision to hire a similarly unqualified party, Robert Klausner, in another important role, that of fiduciary counsel. Recall that Klausner was not a member of the California bar, yet in public board sessions, was giving advice on California law matters such as its Public Records Act. As we pointed out, his advice was contrary to statute. To make matters worse, Klausner had a long track record of being involved in pay-to-play scandals and of telling clients what they wanted to hear, regardless of whether he could come up with a sound legal basis for validating their actions. As California attorney Karl Olson wrote of Klausner: 
This isn't a case of the fox guarding the henhouse; this may be a case of CalPERS going across the country to hire a fox who specialized in building henhouses with no gates. 
But what could possibly be foxy about the historically dull green-eyeshade role of Chief Actuary? 
Recall that the biggest controversy that CalPERS is facing now, and one that is not going away any time soon, is its underfunding problem and its refusal to cut its return assumptions. CalPERS' just-retired former Chief Actuary, Alan Milligan, repeatedly stated that he thought the pension fund needed to lower its return target, and repeated that view in his final appearances before the board in August and September. Given the recent salvo of articles excoriating CalPERS for its refusal to reduce its return targets save on a very attenuated basis that many regard as unrealistic, CalPERS must be relieved that journalists were too inattentive to pick up on the fact that the agency was disregarding the advice of its own designated risk expert. No doubt the agency is keen to get an actuary in place that won't take positions that could make its hard-to-defend posture even more untenable. 
Now let us address the particulars of CalPERS' chicanery with its Chief Actuary job search. 
The Chief Actuary is such an important role that until the board decided to quit doing its job and rubber stamp pretty much everything staff wanted to do, it was one of four direct reports to the board. Reducing the number of direct reports to one has substantially reduced the board's power. If it was unhappy with the activities of staff, it could threaten to fire one of the direct reports other than the CEO, which gave it more surgical ways to intervene. Now it has only the nuclear option of defenestrating the CEO. 
The Chief Actuary, indeed all the actuary positions at CalPERS, is a job classification that is specific to CalPERS. From a letter from an Baldwin, Chief Personnel Management Division, to the Personnel Board from the document at the end of the post: 
The Chief Actuary is appointed to this single-incumbent, statutory position and serves as a key member of the CalPERS Executive Management team, the incumbent provides guidance on all actuarial issues facing CalPERS, including actuarial investigations and valuations, rate structure, health benefits and reserve funds. The Chief Actuary promotes the sound and secure operation of CalPERS enterprises through the oversight of all functions within the ACTO [Actuarial Office], and is responsible for the evaluation, development, and implementation of actuarial policies and procedures. 
The revisions to the proposed role violate the California constitution by eliminating any reporting relationship between the board and the Chief Actuary. On page 4 of the document below: 
First, it's disturbing to see the lengths to which the State Personnel Board is willing to collude with CalPERS in disguising the fact that this job classification applies ONLY to CalPERS. By eliminating any reference to CalPERS, unexperienced investigators would mistakenly assumed that the greatly-watered down job requirements apply to all state agencies that have actuarial groups and thus have a senior actuary in charge, such as CalSTRS and the State Department of Insurance. The very fact of this cover-up alone is a sign that CalPERS knows it is up to no good and is desperate to cover its tracks. 
Second, look at the first sentence of the first paragraph as it is proposed to read (emphasis ours): 
Under the policy direction and administrative direction of the organization's executive and/or director leve l, to manage the actuarial and employer services functions of the organization; to provide expert actuarial advice and consultation to the organization's executive and/or director level; and to do other related work. 
This is an express violation of the California Constitution. Article XVI, section 17(e) states : 
The retirement board of a public pension or retirement system, consistent with the exclusive fiduciary responsibilities vested in it, shall have the sole and exclusive power to provide for actuarial services in order to assure the competency of the assets of the public pension or retirement system. 
Notice the use of 'exclusive and 'sole and exclusive.' At a bare minimum, the board needs to retain policy oversight, but even that is being stripped away in the new job description. The board will have absolutely nada to do with the actuarial function. Also bear in mind that the changes in the proposed language, at least as far as I can tell from looking at recent board meetings, were never reviewed or approved by the board. This is a naked power grab by staff relying on long-standing complacency of CalPERS' board. 
Even more stunning is how this senior role is being downgraded. Note that all positions in the current set of the existing CalPERS pension actuary job series, from 'Associate Pension Actuary' through and including 'Supervising Pension Actuary' require that the employee have an Associateship in the Society of Actuaries . T he Society of Actuaries website states : 
Requirements include examinations, an e-Learning course, validation of educational experiences outside the SOA Education system (VEE), and a professionalism seminar. 
Notice that the new job description allows for minimum qualifications to instead be satisfied by 'Membership in the American Academy of Actuaries'. What, pray tell, is the 'American Academy of Actuaries'? 
It is not a professional organization. One can be member without satisfying any professional credentialing requirements. For instance, one can become a member via being a member of the 'Conference of Consulting Actuaries' which in turn allows for 'Membership for NonSOA/CAS Credentialed Actuaries' 
All actuaries not credentialed by the Society of Actuaries or the Casualty Actuarial Society are required to sign off on a form acknowledging professional awareness of the Qualification Standards and professionalism for actuaries prior to processing his/her application (required by the International Actuarial Association). 
In other words, without even looking hard, there is a route to become a member of the American Academy of Actuaries by saying you've heard about actuarial professional ethics. You don't even have to say you believe in them, just that you know they exist! Although there is a continuing education requirement for the Conference of Consulting Actuaries, if you click through, you can see it is required ' to retain the status of FCA or ACA ' meaning Fellow or Associate, not a mere 'Member'. 
Needless to say, it would be plenty demotivating to CalPERS' existing staff of actuaries to have a new boss parachuted in above them who hadn't gone through the sort of minimum professional accreditation they were required to meet. And it begs the question as to why CalPERS' staff is so desperate to consider candidates that have not been subjected to a basic requirement of passing the Society of Actuaries' exams. Would you ever consider using an attorney, even for informal advice, who had never passed a bar exam? Yet CalPERS and the California Department of Human Resources are about to put in place a job description that would let someone that unqualified in actuarial space take the helm at CalPERS. 
With the vote on this dangerous change set to take place on Thursday, this plot is too far advanced for the usual Naked Capitalism reader route of writing upset missives to CalPERS board members, particularly the elected members who have reason to fear the wrath of voters, to have any effect. I hope you'll forward this post to news organizations and ask them to look into this pronto, since this story is time sensitive. 
Here are some candidates, but feel free to write others (please add helpful ideas in comments, particularly how to contact any talk radio or TV hosts who might take up this story): 
Adam Ashton (aashton@sacbee.com) who posts the Sacramento Bee's State Worker blog 
James Rufus Koren (I assume james.koren@latimes.com given their official convention). He's been doing regular coverage of CalPERS returns. 
Jack Dolan (jack.dolan@latimes.com) at the Los Angeles Times. I have mixed feelings about putting Dolan onto this, since his last story on CalPERS was seriously distorted (his report grossly exaggerated the cost of cost of allowing 'badges' as in mainly prison guards and state highway officers, to retire early and tried pinning CalPERS underfunding on that, when it is due to not continuing to fund the system when it appeared to be overfunded in the dot-com era, and the losses it took in the financial crisis from which it has not fully recovered). However, with CalPERS in the cross-hairs of critics, it needs to work even harder at being above reproach instead of making itself vulnerable to fully-deserved attacks. And this latest development would certainly fit with the dim view he has of the system. However, he may only do longer-form stories and something faster-turnanround may not suit his schedule. 
John Gittelson at Bloomberg (johngitt@bloomberg.net). He's an LA-based asset management reporter at Bloomberg; he's pinged me in the past about past CalPERS stories, always an encouraging sign.

Lambert here: Howard Dean, back in 2003 and before he lost his mind, said : 'I still want to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks. We can't beat George Bush unless we appeal to a broad cross-section of Democrats.' Of course, such a gross violation of liberal class and cultural markers could not be permitted, and Dean was forced to grovel and apologize by the dominant identitarian wing of the Democrat Party and then, when his fifty-state strategy won Democrats control of Congress in 2006, instantly defenestrated by Rahm Emanuel, among others, and his organization gutted by Tim Kaine . When Chomsky asks 'Why are we failing to organize these people?' he's asking a question to which Dean already gave the answer. 
Clinton, of course, thinks that organizing 'these people' is a bad idea, which is why she called them 'deplorable' and 'irredeemable' (and if you're a Christian, as Clinton purports to be, 'irredeemable' means irredeemable). So do many of her supporters, who seem to labor under the twin delusions that (a) 'these people' will go away on the morning of November 9, and that (b) calling them, in various ways, stupid is, as a strategy, full of #win. If Clinton wishes to fail during a legitimacy crisis, she and her supporters should go on exactly as they have begun. Personally, I'm not a 'worse is better' guy (too much suffering), but I confess I see little prospect of the dominant faction in the Democrat Party changing its ways, Dean, Chomsky, or no. 
By Alexandra Rosenmann, AlterNet associate editor. Originally published in Alternet . 
In the past 15 months, Noam Chomsky has weighed in on the U.S. presidential race often. 
'There are differences in the parties,' he said in February, when asked if he'd even consider a Republican over Hillary Clinton. 'Small differences [coupled with] great power can have enormous consequences.' 
Chomsky initally favored Sanders over Clinton, but insisted Democrats must win at all costs. Because according to Chomsky , if Trump wins 'the human species is in very deep trouble. 
But as for Trump's supporters, Chomsky's not counting them out just yet. 
'I'm basically judging by what I see and read about them listening to talk radio and so on,' Chomsky admitted of the protests on the right. 'But my strong impression is that these [right-wing protesters] are people with very real grievances.' 
'They give the impression of being a hard-working serious people who think they've been doing everything right. They've been doing what they're 'supposed' to do [as] god-fearing hard-working, gun-carrying, you know patriotic, Americans,' Chomsky continued. 
'What are they doing wrong and how come their lives are so crummy?' Chomsky asked. 
It's a question that has plagued the election. 
'They're not getting answers,' Chomsky insisted. 'The answers they are getting are not only crazy, but extremely dangerous, so the right response is to ask ourselves, why are we failing to organize these people?' 
There's nothing partisan about losing money to Wall Street or lacking health insurance; issues at the forefront of protests from both sides for nearly a decade. 
'We have not succeeded in unifying people,' Chomsky noted. 'It's our fault.'

By Lambert Strether of Corrente . 
Tomorrow, election day will be only one week away. In this post I want to talk about two distinct subjects. First, I want to talk about the sort of calculation that a Martian might make when confronted by the choice we will face in the voting booth. Then, I'd like to paint a brief picture of what election day would look like, in a world where I didn't want to claw out my eyeballs. 
A Martian Looks at Election Outcomes in 2016 
I say 'Martian,' because a Martian is so detached that the 30,000-foot view looks like a close-up, and I think in this election detachment is a virtue (see above at 'claw out my eyeballs'). 
So a Martian would feel that despite the all the sound and fury, the numbers have not been that crazy (assuming one trusts them). Among registered voters: Emphasizing how remarkably stable the &#39;16 race has been — going back to Sept. 2015 https://t.co/odFykkIm8m pic.twitter.com/2CKuS9Qi9G 
&mdash; Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) October 31, 2016 
RealClearPolitics has a similar chart averaging all the polls with a vertical scale that makes the swings a lot bigger. To me, the pattern of the race is that Clinton starts out with, and retains, a natural institutional advantage of around four points. Again from the head-to-head RCP chart, Trump has closed and then pulled even six times: September 2015, December 2015, February 2016, May 2016, July 2016, and September 2016. And each time either Clinton's institutional advantages have re-asserted themselves, or Trump has shot himself in the foot (take your pick). Trump is closing now. Can he pull ahead and close the deal? Unknown. Based on past performance, no. Then again, as I remarked before the latest email eruption, 'a week is a long time in politics,' Wikileaks has yet to drop its final shoe, and each campaign probably has a garbage truck full of oppo fired up and ready to go. 
Paradoxically, Martians are not warlike, since the thin air, small population, and harsh conditions on Mars make war a species-threatening event. For the same reason, Martians prize the deep memories of elders while treating every child as precious. And Martians resist 'Marsization,' because the one time there actually was a single, Mars-wide, cosmopolitan class of elite overlords they tried to invade the Earth, and who knows where that would have led! So if you were a Martian, and you believed that Clinton's election would lead to a new war , and you believe that endorsing Bowles-Simpson and 'hemispheric trade' in a speech at Goldman Sachs mean a Grand Bargain and TPP passage respectively, then you might look askance at a likely Clinton victory. What do do? If you had a Martian friend who followed American elections obsessively — this is similar to Southeast Asian countries where people obsessively follow English Premier League football — this is what your friend might tell you: 
The last thing you want is for Clinton to be able to enact her (real, private) agenda. Sure, she might make some small good changes, but if you throw war, a Grand Bargain, and the surrender of national sovereignty with another so-called trade deal on one side of the scale, it's hard to see what outweighs them on the other, at least in terms of concrete material benefits.[1] So, working on the assumption that Clinton will win, what you need is: 
A Republican House . Here, the checks and balances built into the American system favor gridlock, and gridlock is your friend, since little legislation will get passed. Whether the House Republicans impeach Clinton if the Senate is in Democrat hands is an open question, but with Clinton having privatized the email server for her public office and the shenanigans at the Clinton Foundation , the Clinton administration will provide a target-rich environment. I woudn't put it past them to try to take Clinton's security clearance away! 
A Democrat Senate . The emergence of left(ish) party barons with independent power bases is the untold story of election 2016. Warren is at least sound on banksters and financial power, and Sanders, while not a Bolshevik, is well to the left of the Democrat mainstream. That's a Good Thing. Both are prolific fundraisers who don't need the DNC. If the Republicans hold the Senate, the tendency will be for Democrats to stick together. If the Democrats do, then Baron Warren and Baron Sanders (and allies like Sherrod Brown ) will feel more free to drag the party left. 
A close race . If Clinton wins, she'll claim a mandate if the margin is a tenth of a percent. But in the same way that anybody can print money, but the trick is getting other people to accept it, others will be less likely to accept her claim the closer the result is. (I think the result would have to be better than the four points Obama beat Romney by — 51.1% to 47.2% — and as of today, Clinton's margin is 2.8% in RCP's four-way average .) Of course, Bush claimed a mandate in 2004, too — true story: I managed to Google-bomb 'Bush mandate' to Mandate magazine, back in the day when Google-bombing wasn't hard — and proceeded to try to gut Social Security, whereupon the Democrats promptly gutted him and went on to win the 2006 mid-terms. But why make it easy? 
So, that's the Martian perspective on the race. Surprisingly or not, the personal characteristics of puny Earthling candidates are not a factor! Nor are cultural or class markers! 
Elections on Mars 
Here is how Election Day works on Mars. Again because of planetary and cultural characteristics, Martians reserve tricky and complex electronic devices for important things, like distributed Martian parallel chess, or space operas. They are also convivial, and they hate to be manipulated by large and opaque forces (that time the Jovians invaded). Obviously, I can't provide links for most of this — the Uniform Resource Locator is a global standard, not an interplanetary one — but in short form: 
1. On Mars, Election Day is a national holiday. That's because Martians, unlike American Earthlings, think that everybody should have an equal opportunity to vote. Voting is equally easy for almost every Martian, whether they work or not. 
2. The Martians use hand-marked paper ballots, hand-counted in public. This is remarkably similar to international standards on Earth (which the United States does not use): 
Last March, the country's highest court found that secret, computerized vote counting was unconstitutional. Unfortunately, the country was Germany, and the Constitution violated by e-voting systems was the one that the U.S. wrote and insisted Germans ratify as part of their terms of surrender following WWII. 
Paul Lehto, a U.S. election attorney and Constitutional rights expert, summarized the German court's unambiguous, landmark finding : 'No 'specialized technical knowledge' can be required of citizens to vote or to monitor vote counts.' There is a 'constitutional requirement of a publicly observed count.' '[T]he government substitution of its own check or what we'd probably call an 'audit' is no substitute at all for public observation.' 'A paper trail simply does not suffice to meet the above standards. 'As a result of these principles,…'all independent observers' conclude that 'electronic voting machines are totally banned in Germany' because no conceivable computerized voting system can cast and count votes that meet the twin requirements of…being both 'observable' and also not requiring specialized technical knowledge. 
Hand-counting paper ballots is no good at all, argue critics, unless you really want to know who the actual winner of the election was… 
After the verdict in the case — filed by a computer expert and his political scientist son — Lehto wondered how it could be that open, observable democracy is seemingly an inviolable right for 'conquered Nazis,' but not, apparently, for citizens of the United States… 
3. The Martians throw a big party at the precinct after the paper ballots have all been hand-counted. That's partly because Martians are convivial, but also because the Martians think that democracy is important and ought to be celebrated. (Again, because the Martian population is small, they wish to begin the conciliation process between winner and loser immediately, lest fratricidal violence result, and there's no better way to do that than over food.) 
4. The Martians regulate all forms of political advertising for size (small) and frequency (not often), whether for candidates or policies. That's because the Martians wish to minimize manipulatio by encouraging face-to-face forms of persuasion and deliberation in public venues wherever possible. 
5. The Martians ban published polling data thirty days before the election. That's because Martians believe that they each should vote for their own reasons, and that elections (unlike markets) are not (manipulative) beauty contests. 
Conclusions 
Crazy Martians! What are they thinking? 
NOTES 
[1] Sadly, the time for an all-out assault on Republican 'obstructionism' was 2009, when all the stars had aligned: The Republicans had no credibility, and the Democrats had the House, the Senate, the most powerful orator of our time (so it was said), in the White House, and a mandate for 'hope and change.' Of course, Obama (assuming good faith) squandered this opportunity, starting with his inaugural speech, if not before.

ARTICLE

by Yves Smith 
Yves here. Even by the normal, as in low, standards of New York Times defenses of Wall Street, the Roger Lowenstein piece that Black shellacks is particularly inept. 
By Bill Black, the author of The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One and an associate professor of economics and law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Originally published at New Economic Perspectives 
When last I wrote of Roger Lowenstein he was complaining that the Wall Street felons were being criticized – not jailed – criticized. Lowenstein is Wall Street's self-appointed apologist-in-chief. Naturally, he despises Senator Warren, the most effective elected official in exposing Wall Street's elite frauds. The New York Times granted him an op ed in which he sought to mansplain financial regulation to Senator Warren. 
Lowenstein does not like women that he considers too loud, gratuitously complaining that Senator Warren is 'high-decibel' supporter of regulation. Coming from someone who has spent his journalistic career shilling for Wall Street, this sexist trope is painfully embarrassing. Wall Street is infamous for raging males who believe that screaming at subordinates who can't fight back proves their virility. 
Lowenstein was piling on to the recent sexist attack of Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer, an ultra-right wing Missouri Republican, on Senator Warren. Congressman Luetkemeyer , a senior member of House Financial Services, was speaking to the American Bankers Association when he labeled Senator Warren the 'Darth Vader of the financial services world' and pleaded with the bankers to work with the Trump Republicans to 'neuter her.' The Kansas City Star coverage of this Trumpian assault on women notes that Congressman Luetkemeyer 'led multiple congressional efforts to protect the payday loan industry, according to fortune.com.' 
Senator Warren, who is decidedly not a screamer, is the target of Lowenstein and Luetkemeyer's wrath because Wall Street's greatest fear is the return of effective regulators who would end the elite frauds and make the criminal referrals that would imprison thousands of Wall Street's elite criminals. Wall Street knows that Senators Warren, Sanders and Brown are working tirelessly to ensure that the next president appoints regulatory leaders that would restore the rule of law to Wall Street. Lowenstein and Congressman Luetkemeyer are desperate to defeat that effort. 
Lowenstein wrote that his article was prompted by Senator Warren's recommendation that President Obama fire Mary Jo White as the chair of the SEC. Because Senator Warren understands federal regulation, she made no such recommendation. Senator Warren requested President Obama to designate another SEC commissioner as the Chair. The President does have that power. 
Ms. White has been an exceptionally weak leader of the SEC. I witnessed Ms. White's presentation at the annual law professors meeting years ago giving her ode to 'good earnings management.' 'Earnings management' is one of many euphemisms for a form of accounting securities fraud that reduces the value of corporation in order to 'hit the number' and maximize the officers' bonuses. The revolving door perverted someone who once was a moderately effective prosecutor into a very well paid apologist for elite frauds. President Obama is notorious for appointing weak law enforcement officials at the Department of Justice and the financial regulatory agencies. Senator Warren is correct to call on President Obama to transfer the chair to a more capable SEC commissioner. 
Senator Warren knows that there is no chance that President Obama will request Ms. White's resignation or no longer designate her as the SEC Chair. Senator Warren is establishing her consistency and serving notice on the next president that the democratic-wing of the Democratic Party will push for appointees in the next administration that will be dedicated to restoring the rule of law to Wall Street. Lowenstein has no expertise in regulation. Senator Warren is one of the Nation's experts in financial regulation. As one would predict, his pretense of mansplaining financial regulation to Senator Warren went hilariously wrong. Lowenstein begins with a fundamental error that betrays the fact that he does not understand even the basics of federal regulation. 
Last time I checked, the S.E.C. was a regulatory agency of the executive branch…. 
The SEC is an independent regulatory agency, as was the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) when I worked for it — and unlike the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) when I worked for it. The OTS was 'a regulatory agency of the executive branch.' The normal view under U.S. jurisprudence is that the independent regulatory agencies such as the SEC are 'creatures of Congress.' The problem is not that the SEC became an independent regulatory agency since the 'last time [Lowenstein] checked.' The SEC was created as an independent regulatory agency in 1934 and has remained one for its entire existence. 
Lowenstein never understood the SEC's legal nature because he never 'checked' on the SEC's legal nature. Had he checked, he would have found statements such as this by the SEC : 
[A]s an independent regulatory agency the SEC is not obligated to follow the guidelines for regulatory economic analysis by executive agencies…. 
Building on this initial error, Lowenstein imagines President Obama's response to Senator Warren's call for President Obama to ask Ms. White to resign as Chair of the SEC: 
'Hey, firing agency heads is my job.' 
Well, no. The President cannot 'fire' the heads of independent regulatory agencies such as the SEC, precisely because they are not 'executive branch' agencies. The SEC Commissioners do not serve 'at the pleasure of the president.' 
I am delighted that progressives such as Senators Sanders and Warren blocked Larry Summers' appointment to chair the Federal Reserve, which led to the well-deserved appointment of Janet Yellen to Chair the Fed. Progressives were enthused that progressives such as Senators Sanders and Warren blocked Antonio Weiss — whose only ostensible qualification for the Treasury slot was that he was an investment banker who contributed to the crisis rather than warning about it and trying to prevent it. Contrary to Lowenstein's assertion, Weiss had to be pushed by Senators Sanders and Warren to even begin to respond to Puerto Rico's bankruptcy. 
The thing that the Street will never forgive Senator Warren for is the thing they claim they value as their preeminent virtue — she succeeds. Indeed, she succeeds despite their intense opposition and their rage against her. They try to go head-to-head with her and she hands them their heads. CEOs like Wells Fargo's John Stumpf are so used to being surrounded by sycophants that tell them how brilliant they are that they approach prepping for Senator Warren's questions with contempt and immense over-confidence. Then she tears into them and they look like a deer frozen in place by headlights while being eviscerated by a wolverine. The best that Lowenstein can muster in his attempted takedown of Senator Warren is that 'there is no good evidence' that Stumpf resigned because of Senator Warren's evisceration of him. Senator Warren has never claimed that Stumpf resigned due to her questioning. Prior to the Senate hearings the commentators were virtually unanimous that he would not resign. After the hearings, he was doomed. 
Wall Streeters' belief that they are far smarter than anyone else (because they pay themselves more than almost everyone) and should run the economy and the government by divine right is a form of arrogance so central to their self-definition that they are frequently clueless about the most basic facts of finance, e.g., a 'flight to quality' will produce highly correlated changes in interest rates among a wide range of securities. Lowenstein propagated this Wall Street 'genius' myth in his best-known book ( When Genius Failed ). The 'geniuses' he profiles in the book were unable to understand that a 'flight to quality' would render their investing strategy suicidal. 
Lowenstein's ode to the revolving door rests on his assertions about the supposed Wall Street giants of federal regulation. His assertions will strike most readers, correctly, as bizarre. He asserts that 'many of the best' financial regulators came from Wall Street, giving three supposed examples including Henry M. Paulson Jr., a Treasury Secretary under the second President Bush. Unsurprisingly, Robert Rubin, President Bill Clinton's Treasury Secretary wrote a glowing review in the NYT's of Lowenstein's most recent book. Rubin and Paulson share a number of characteristics. They both were the leaders of Goldman Sachs before being appointed as Treasury Secretary. They both presided over the three 'de's' – deregulation, desupervision, and de facto decriminalization of finance. They both are immensely culpable for creating the criminogenic environment that produced the three most damaging epidemics of accounting control fraud in history. Those fraud epidemics hyper-inflated the bubble and drove the financial crisis. The fact that Lowenstein cites Paulson as one of the greatest financial regulators in history and the fact that Rubin wrote such an over-the-top review of the supposed brilliance of Lowenstein demolish Lowenstein's credibility and his claim that the revolving door that leads Wall Street. His modern hero was one of the important contributors to the catastrophe. 
Lowenstein's second proposed Wall Street hero is Arthur Levitt, who worked for a series of Wall Street firms before being appointed as Chairman of the SEC. After he left the SEC he worked for Goldman Sachs. Levitt did try to make some reforms as Chairman of the SEC. Mr. Levitt, however, was ultimately critically flawed – and those flaws came from the dogmas he absorbed from his many years on Wall Street. I discuss one of those flaws below. 
Lowenstein fails to even mention this Nation's most effective financial regulator, Edwin Gray, Chairman of the FHLBB. This is unsurprising because Gray was successful largely because he had no Wall Street ties. Gray's most virulent foe in the government was Donald Regan, the former head of Merrill Lynch, and the fiercest proponent of the deregulation that made the savings and loan industry so criminogenic that George Akerlof and Paul Romer concluded it was 'bound' to produce widespread ' looting .' Gray enraged Mr. Regan by seeking to regulate against deposit brokers. Merrill Lynch was the Nation's largest deposit broker. Gray's top supervisors who proved so brilliantly successful in countering the raging fraud epidemics in Texas and California that drove the savings and loan debacle, Joe Selby and Michael Patriarca, were long-time government employees who had never worked for Wall Street. None of regulatory leaders who distinguished themselves in containing the debacle came from Wall Street. 
Lowenstein fails to mention the sole federal regulatory leader of the last 20 years who sought to emulate Gray and serve as a vigorous financial reregulator – Brooksley Born – who attempted to regulate financial derivatives. Ms. Born's efforts were destroyed by a bipartisan coalition of Wall Street officials and alums holding key government positions that exemplify the dangers of the revolving door. That coalition included Bill Clinton (as President of the U.S., soon to be made wealthy by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms for speeches with obscene payoffs), Treasury Secretary Rubin (former CEO of Goldman Sachs and soon-to-be be made even wealthier as a top officer of Citigroup where he had no real job duties), Mr. Greenspan (Chairman of the Fed; Wall Streeter before and after), Eugene Ludwig (Comptroller of the Currency; soon to leave to be made wealthy by Bankers Trust/Deutsche Bank, the giant serially criminal enterprise that is Germany's largest bank), Senator Gramm (Chairman of Senate Banking; later made wealthy by UBS, the giant, serially criminal enterprise that is one of Switzerland's largest banks) – as well as both of Lowenstein's purported modern financial regulatory heroes – Mr. Paulson (while he was running Goldman Sachs, before being named by the second President Bush as his Treasury Secretary) and Mr. Levitt (when he was SEC Chairman, before he would take the revolving door to Goldman Sachs). Note that Mr. Paulson was only one of the infamous '13 Bankers' (the CEOs of the largest banks) who met with Treasury Secretary Rubin to (successfully) demand that Ms. Born's be forbidden to regulate huge classes of financial derivatives, including credit default swaps(CDS). 
You can see why Lowenstein left out of his column any discussion of these Wall Streeters racing through the revolving door to enrich themselves and other Wall Street officers at the expense of our Nation and people all over the world by bringing together this assemblage of naked political and economic power to crush Ms. Born's efforts to fulfill her statutory duties as Chair of the CFTC. I agree that Mr. Levitt was the least bad regulator of this corrupt coalition. Mr. Levitt has conceded that his attacks on Ms. Born were disgraceful and erroneous. 
As best I can tell, Senator Warren takes a position about the revolving door that is very similar to mine. We do not oppose any appointment of people of Wall Street to government. We oppose the continued domination of the regulatory agencies and executive agencies by Wall Street personnel. That domination has produced a pathetic track record of intentional failure due not simply to conflicts of interest and self-interest, but even more to the anti-regulatory dogmas that are endemic on Wall Street. Neither our economy nor our democracy can afford the terrible cost of this continued, corrupt domination. The domination has perverted the U.S. into a system of crony capitalism. As one of my fellow co-founders of Bank Whistleblowers United (BWU), Gary Aguirre (formerly an SEC enforcement attorney before he blew the whistle of the SEC leadership) stresses, the SEC routinely waives for former senior SEC officials the existing revolving door restrictions. BWU has called on the SEC to end this indefensible practice. 
Lowenstein then makes another dishonest claim about the SEC. 
When the S.E.C. has landed in trouble, it has usually been because it has wandered from its charter and ignored its bread-and-butter responsibility (see Madoff, Bernie). 
That statement is carefully crafted to mislead the reader. The SEC failed with regard to Bernie Madoff by refusing to act on clear evidence of fraud provided by multiple whistleblowers. Madoff was an example of a variant of the revolving door. Mr. Madoff was a Wall Streeter who became for years the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the NASD, a self-regulatory association that functions under aegis of the SEC. The SEC generally treats the NASD as a quasi-public ally. The SEC was reluctant to believe warnings about Mr. Madoff because of his former role as the NASD's leader. 
The SEC did not get in 'trouble' with Madoff because it 'ignored' its core responsibilities to divert large of resources in order to take on some exotic, tangential function. Lowenstein simply invented that fiction. The SEC got in trouble in large part because of the combination of the revolving door and Congressional Republicans' war on the SEC budget. The Republicans want the SEC to be ineffective as a regulator because the Wall Street's leaders who are criminals fear a vigorous SEC. 
Lowenstein knows that this Republican war is a critical threat to the Nation, but asserts a policy implication of this war that is nonsensical to anyone but Wall Street's apologist-in-chief. 
[T]he S.E.C. faces continual pressure on its budget from a skeptical and unappreciative Congress. The last thing it needs is political grandstanding from Ms. Warren. 
Note that Lowenstein dishonestly uses the term 'Congress' instead of 'Congressional Republicans.' The Congressional Republicans are not 'skeptical and unappreciative' of the SEC – they are virulently hostile to effective securities (and financial derivatives) regulation. This exceptional hostility has been a constant feature preventing the SEC and CFTC from having adequate resources to fulfill their statutory duties since the early 1990s. Criminologists call this the deliberate creation of 'systems incapacity.' Senators Sanders, Brown, and Warren are the strongest supporters of the SEC and the CFTC receiving the substantial increases in budget required for these agencies to perform their statutory missions. Logically, Lowenstein should be criticizing virtually every Republican member of Congress and praising Senator Warren and her progressive allies. Instead he refuses to identify the Republicans as the source of problem and attacks only Senator Warren – implying dishonestly that if she would stop pushing for the SEC to restore the rule of law to Wall Street the Republicans would cease their actions on behalf of criminal Wall Street elites designed to gut the SEC's ability to counter the elite Wall Street frauds. 0 0 0 0 0 0

ARTICLE

by Outis Philalithopoulos By Outis Philalithopoulos, who met an untimely end five years ago, and now 'wears the chains he forged in life' as an economist. In our story so far , a cyclops challenged Outis to discover possibly inconvenient truths about liberalism, and proposed the help of three Spirits. Through the gloom, there sounded the deep, hollow, melancholy note of a bell. I turned, and there stood a strange figure. It seemed rather aged, and yet the face, and the smooth, hairless head, had not a wrinkle in it. The arms were very long and muscular, and the feet were bare. 'Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?' I asked. 'I am!' He spoke with a French accent, in a voice that was even and clear. 'Who and what are you?' I demanded. 'I am the Ghost of Liberalism Past. My name is Michel Foucault.' 'Oh,' I said. 'Should I know that name?' 'What?' the Spirit exclaimed, with a flash of pride. Then he sighed. 'I suppose,' he said, 'it is better if my phantom no longer casts its shadow upon the world, as if I were some sort of great Astrologer surveying an atemporal sky, telling people what is good and what is not.' 'But you were famous?' I asked, feeling bad that I had hurt his feelings. 'Oh, sure,' he said with a trace of self-mockery. 'Noam Chomsky once said that he had 'never met anyone who was so totally amoral.' I tried to teach people about madness, medicine, and sexuality, but most wrote me off as this radical anarchist with an absolute hatred of power.' 'And that wasn't true?' 'No!' he exclaimed. 'Power is not always repressive.' I struggled to understand. 'By power, do you mean government? Or one social group oppressing another?' 'These are only a few particular instances of power,' Foucault explained. 'Power is anything that tends to render immobile and untouchable those things that are offered to us as real, as true, as good.' 'That sounds kind of… bad,' I replied. 'Listen, listen,' Foucault replied. 'How difficult it is! I'm not a prophet. I'm not going to tell people, 'This is good for you, this is bad for you!' I try to analyze a real situation in its various complexities, with the goal of allowing refusal, and curiosity, and innovation. Is it clearer, now?' I shook my head. 'I find your world confusing. It's like there are no points of orientation…' Foucault gazed at me mildly. 'Perhaps, in time…' he murmured. Then he clasped me by the arm. 'Rise! And walk with me!' I took a step – and found myself outside a snowy yard covered in red brick. 'What?' I stammered. 'Here is where I wrote my thesis…' 'You remember it, then?' inquired the Spirit. 'Remember it?' I cried. 'I could walk this campus blindfolded.' 'Let us go in, then.' We walked through the doors of the Kennedy School of Government, into the midst of a boisterous crowd of students. Seconds later, they fell silent, and the president of the Young Democrats announced the speaker. It was Al Franken, presenting his book Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot . I hadn't heard Franken's name in a while, but something tugged at my memory. I looked questioningly at Foucault. '1996,' was his only response, as laughter echoed from the audience. Franken had begun speaking. I soon found myself nodding along with Franken's words. Franken pointed out that Limbaugh had 'tapped into the resentments of the 'angry white male,'' mentioning his 'studio audience of rabid – but extraordinarily straight-laced – right-wing yahoos.' He went on to talk about some of the crazy religious people he had met while touring the country. 'By now, you may be thinking I'm showing an anti-Christian bias,' Franken suggested, grinning. 'Nonsense! Need I remind you that I married a Roman Catholic, whom I met in college, despoiled and then convinced to renounce the Pope?' The crowd roared with laughter. I joined them, although something about that word 'despoiled' rubbed me the wrong way. Franken added that Limbaugh believes feminists think all heterosexual sex is rape. 'The thing is,' Franken said, 'I know a lot of women, almost all of whom consider themselves feminists, and I know of only one who actually holds this belief. And we've been married nearly twenty years.' As the room rocked with laughter, my jaw dropped. Making light of the victims of marital rape? What was Franken's problem? Franken said that at one point, when Limbaugh had not been famous, he had been so poor that his wife had made him go file for unemployment. Franken addressed Limbaugh directly. 'I swear, you must be the biggest pussy on God's green Earth. My God, you are a sad, sad creature, aren't you? Sort of a she-male?' I was sure Franken was right and Limbaugh was a horrible person, but how could he not see how problematic his statements were? Reinforcing gender normativity? Negative references to female anatomy? Why wasn't anyone in the audience besides me concerned? Most likely people were concerned, but felt too marginalized to say anything. Franken had meanwhile moved on to the big picture. What was the fundamental issue with guys like Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich and Pat Robertson? 'You know what I dislike most about these guys? They're always so certain. They're always 100 percent sure of what they're saying.' He paused for a split second. 'This is why I like being a Democrat. When we see a complicated, intractable problem, we have the only really genuine, authentic human reaction you can have: we're confused.' I stared at Foucault. When Allan Bloom had claimed that liberals are terrified of people who think they are right, I had assumed he was describing a colony on Neptune. Maybe he was instead talking about people like Franken and Foucault. Foucault smiled back at me. Franken started to discuss various controversial issues. President Clinton's crime bill paid for a lot of new prisons, and that's good. Riiight. I have no problem frying a murderer. In some cases I'd even waive the cruel-and-unusual punishment. That is, as long as we know we have the right guy. Right. What kind of progressive/liberal was this guy, anyway? Wait, what was that about a 'national Ponzi scheme currently scheduled to implode in a spectacular fiscal nightmare'? Pete Peterson, a co-founder of the Concord Coalition, did hit a home run with a very sobering speech about what will happen if we don't reform social security. Okaaay. Franken talked about watching Pat Buchanan speak to members of the Reform Party. He counted six standing ovations, 'although it's hard to count when you're cowering under your seat.' The biggest ovations had come on the crowd's 'red meat issues,' such as NAFTA and the 1995 Mexican bank bailout, on which Buchanan had said: Politicians of both parties sold us out in Washington, D.C. They took Citibank and Chase Manhattan and J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs off the hook, and they put us on. Well, […] when I get to the White House, NAFTA will be canceled! To me, the speech sounded like something Matt Taibbi would say. Why did it frighten Franken so much? An uncomfortable subject that's not discussed enough is black on black crime. Jesse Jackson had the courage to talk about it in terms that most people can identify with. He said it pains him that when he's walking down the street at night and hears footsteps, he's relieved if it's a white man and not a black man. I know exactly what he means. I was leaving NBC late one night and heard some footsteps. When I turned around, I saw it was Jesse Jackson, and it scared the living daylights out of me! The audience thought this was hysterical. Why hadn't the real progressives organized to deplatform this guy? Franken returned to the topic of anti-establishment, anti-free trade Americans in his final windup. Some of them were crackpots, sure. But I thought about Hank from Michigan, a retired autoworker who was worried about jobs moving overseas. I thought about Louise from Washington state, who was scared for her children because wages for non-college graduates have fallen 20 percent in the last twenty years. I thought about how our political system appeals to the worst, not the best, in us. And I thought about this book. Maybe, I thought, I'm on the wrong track. Maybe I'm sowing the very seeds of distrust that I so decry. Perhaps, I thought, I should throw away the 200-plus pages of cheap, tawdry, mean-spirited (yet accurate) bile, and start over on a book whose humor heals rather than wounds. Then, as we flew over Manhattan, it occurred to me that my book was due in a week. Then we flew over my daughter's private school. And then my son's orthodontist. Followed by the bank that holds the mortgage on my apartment. And as the plane banked its wings, a stream of light pierced the window, bathing my face in the orange glow of the sun setting over the American continent. And I thought to myself, 'You know, Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot.' 'He sells out his principles to maintain his cushy lifestyle and then brags about it?' I wondered incredulously, as laughter and applause reverberated around me. ' Allez, viens ,' Foucault said, beckoning. A long line of students waited to talk with Franken, who beamed and autographed copies of his book. A rather earnest-looking young man and woman were walking towards us. 'Did you like it, Outis?' she asked with an accent a bit like Foucault's. 'It was hilarious,' the young man said. 'But Corinne, did you…' 'Yes, it was good,' she said. 'Rush Limbaugh really is a negative person and it's scary that there are so many insane people in your country. But…' 'Oh, yes,' said the young Outis. 'The talk over in your department…' 'I know you're not thrilled about it,' Corinne began. Outis said, 'The way they talk…' Corinne completed the thought. 'It can be hard to understand. And honestly…' and her voice lowered, as if she were afraid of being overheard, 'a lot of postmodernist scholars are just BS artists who spout the jargon to get good jobs.' The young Outis nodded. Corinne continued with some passion. 'But sometimes people just use that as an excuse not to listen to the important things they say. And this speaker's different.' 'I suppose she's not very well known…?' Corinne eyes danced. 'Well, you are an economist…' 'But that doesn't mean I'm a complete illiterate,' Outis shot back. 'Come on, I'm familiar with a lot of postmodernists – Derrida, Stanley Fish, Judith Butler, Edward Said…' 'But you've never heard of her ,' Corinne finished. 'Well, maybe she isn't as chic as some of the others, but she's very smart – and clearer than most of them.' 'Sure,' Outis said uncertainly. Corinne frowned. Outis took on what he doubtless assumed was a cunning expression. 'I'd be more excited to go if afterward we slip out for a walk down the Charles.' She smiled cunningly back at him. I looked desperately at Foucault. 'Spirit,' I cried. 'Show me no more!' * * * In the next episode, Outis becomes more certain that postmodernist liberalism was not a myth after all. Sources : For Foucault, see this interview . At one point, the interviewer remarks, 'I have to admit, I find myself a bit lost, without points of orientation, in your world […]' All Franken statements are verbatim quotes from Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot (1996). 0 0 0 0 0 0

Yesterday, we put out an alarm in a post titled, CalPERS Plans to Violate California Constitution, Pave Way for Hiring Under-Qualified Candidate, for Critically Important Job of Chief Actuary . 
At 12:20 PM, which is 9:20 AM Sacramento time, I received this e-mail from Brad Pacheco, CalPERS' head of media relations. I didn't see it until later in the day because I work nights and then go through my e-mail box in reverse chronological order: 
Yves, 
I saw your post about our Chief Actuary position. I wanted to let you know that we are no longer pursuing the change to the position and the item is being pulled from the Nov. 3 meeting. The intent of the change was to help us cast the net wide in our search. We feel good about the candidate pool that we have so we are forgoing the change. 
Please let me know if you have any questions, Brad 
This is certainly very good news, and thanks to you readers who contacted potentially journalists as we requested. 
For those of you wondering about the timing, meaning as to whether CalPERS had requested the removal of its proposed revisions to the Chief Actuary Specification Classification from the agenda of the November 3 meeting of the State Personnel Board before our post ran, that seems unlikely. 
First, under California law, notices for public meetings, including the agendas and any materials that are part of any deliberative process, are to be published ten days before the session. Admittedly, the State Personnel Board could have released its agenda earlier, but my observation of California agencies is that the usual practice is to stick with the minimum notice period (I've upon occasion seen CalPERS be a day late). The item had also been on the agenda of the October 6 State Personnel Board meeting and was pushed back to November. Inside sources tell me that the actuaries at CalPERS met before the original October meeting, upset at the fact that the new specifications might even allow a non-actuary to be appointed as Chief Actuary. So given the degree of upset in the department in question, it would have behooved CalPERS to withdraw the revisions sooner rather than later if that had been the intent before yesterday. 
Second, the interviews for Chief Actuary started in Sacramento at 9:30 AM Pacific time yesterday….a mere ten minutes after Pacheco e-mailed me. Given that CalPERS was using an outside search firm, Heidrick & Struggles, to find candidates, and the search process has a certain degree of formality about it, the idea that CalPERS suddenly found a raft of better candidates and changed its mind this late in the game for that reason seems unlikely. 
Fortunately, CalPERS corrected this mistake rather than expose itself to more media criticism. With the investing environment as difficult as it is, and with public pension funds under even fiercer attack than before, high profile players like CalPERS need to as pure as Caesar's wife . Hopefully the organization will act accordingly. 0 0 0 0 0 0

What we learned even in the 90s—there are never, ever any standards for a journalist writing about Russia. Ever. The more bigoted and fantastical, the better. And when your hack crap is completely 100% debunked by other revelations, no editor will ever, ever discipline you. The only way you can have problems with Russia journalism is if you step away from the herd. No editor will ever forgive you for it.

My wife is linked to Putin – she's Russian. I'm linked to Putin – his friend Oleg Deripaska tried to kill me. 
Fridman is busy exiting from Russia as fast as he can go – and may lose Vimpelcom Russia in consequence. The recent DoJ corruption penalty for Vimpelcom — $795M – indicates a reasonable lack of fondness on his part for the current US administration, but then Fridman has hired Richard Burt (Reagan-Bush) and Tom McLarty (Clinton) to 'advise' – meaning lobby for him to get approvals from the Treasury, State and CIA for takeovers of fresh US assets, such as FreedomPop. And they are going through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, so the Trump 'connection' can't be as bad as the Clintonites make out. 
Burt and McLarty are advisors to the LetterOne board, not directors on the Alfa Bank board. If Burt is considered a Trump man – e.g., , http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-campaign-lobbyist-russian-pipeline-229264 — how to explain he was vintage Reagan and Bush? I remember Burt well – short, narcissistic (adolescent acne the cause), not very bright, would do anything to please, especially for money: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-campaign-lobbyist-russian-pipeline-229264 If Burt is such a Trumpie, and McLarty a Clintonite, what happens when they want to use the office toilet at the same time? And then John Negroponte arrives, hustled by Stu Eizenstat (ex Carter) – does ideology get in their way, or do their money interests encourage them to form an orderly line? Look at this list of McLarty's associates: http://maglobal.com/about-us/our-team/john-negroponte / 
And another desperate story at Slate, which I cringe at dignifying by linking to it: Was a Trump Server Communicating With Russia? I hate having to attack this garbage; recall Glenn Greenwald saying how he despised Trump yet excoriating the MSM going all in running any and every fact-challenged or badly stretched attack on Trump, when there is plenty of bona-fide dirt on him already. Outsourcing this again to Ames who has seen more of this than I have: 
The super-secret server linkup is one of the most inane supermarket spy pulp fantasies I've seen. It's cartoon-bad. Most conspiracy theorists work a lot harder on their inane inventions than this. It relies on total ignorance, on a cartoonish grasp of how linkups would work. 
And Helmer again:

Donald Trump Used Legally Dubious Method to Avoid Paying Taxes New York Times. Par for the course for the New York Times. Article hyperventilates about supposedly improper behavior by Trump, yet the basis for the case is that what he did was later made impermissible. I deducted interest I paid on my one little student loan in the early 1980s because prior to the 1986 Tax Reform Act, all consumer interest was tax deductible. By the standards of the Times' fulminating, what I did then was similarly 'legally dubious.' Help me. 
On top of that, from what I infer from this piece, which is not at all clear on what Trump supposedly did (it tries to make his sin about failure to report, which sounds like a stretch; the IRS does have audit powers), it still appears that Lee Sheppard's analysis of why what Trump did in 1995 was kosher then but not kosher later is the best account to date. And that was out a full month ago. Her article specifically discussed why the cancellation of debt income did not appear on his tax return at the time. I am putting the key part of her discussion (it was unpaywalled for weeks but now Tax Analysts has hidden it again) at the very end of this post so the geeky can see what a stretch the Times' treatment is.

TTP, TTIP, TISA 
CETA: 'The provisional application of CETA refers to the fact that some things—like the tariff reductions—will come into operation immediately, assuming the European Parliament agrees. But other areas, notably the ISDS/ICS, must wait for full ratification of the deal. That requires all of the EU's 28 member states to go through national ratification processes, which will probably take several years' [ Ars Technica ]. 'And despite what the commission would have you think, it is by no means certain that all the national parliaments will approve CETA.' More: 
For example, a tweet by Katharina Nocun pointed out that left-wing and green parties could block its passage in Germany. At various times, there have been hints that other countries' parliaments may not agree to the deal, but it's not yet clear what the current situation is around the EU….. 
Another serious threat to CETA's coming into force are legal challenges. As part of the deal to obtain Wallonia's permission to sign CETA, the EU agreed that the ICS framework would be examined by the EU's highest court, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). If the CJEU finds that the approach is incompatible with the EU's fundamental principles, it will either have to be dropped from CETA (and TTIP ), or CETA itself will fall (as will TTIP). 
In addition, there are two constitutional challenges to CETA, one in Canada , and one in Germany. 
Good wrap-up of the state of play. 
TTIP: ' A much-debated trade deal between the European Union and the United States is not dead and negotiations will continue with the new U.S. administration after November's elections, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said on Saturday' [ Reuters ]. TTIP dresses up for Halloween. As a zombie! 
TPP: '[new Zealand] Prime Minister John Key believes the TPP still has a 50-50 chance of being passed in the lame-duck Congressional period after the November 8 presidential election' [ Otago Daily Times ]. 
TPP: 'TPP Is Exciting. Let's Make the Case for It' [Tyler Cown, Bloomberg ]. 'So what then is the exciting, big-picture case for TPP? I say it's to keep North America, and especially the U.S., the world's leading economic cluster for the foreseeable future.' It's a cluster, alright. 
TPP: 'Only 38 per cent of Japanese want to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, according to a survey published by the newspaper Nikkei, showing a growing public distrust of free trade agreements' [ The Advertiser ]. 'The government of Japan under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has proposed to ratify the TPP before the end of the current parliamentary session, on November 30, in order to ensure that Japan is the first country to give its assent to the agreement.' 
2016 
Days until: 6. That's less than a week! 
Corruption 
'If there is any lesson to be learned from the ghosts of Watergate, it is that the big-money support of a leader who has lost the ability to deliver the goods crumbles very quickly as the endgame unfolds' [ Of Two Minds ]. 
Downballot 
'Democrats are poised to gain seats in the House of Representatives this year, but with well over a dozen competitive races still viewed as tossups just one week before Election Day, the extent of that gain — and whether Republicans can stem the bleeding and keep a strong grip on their majority — remains uncertain' [ RealClearPolitics ]. 'GOP insiders say their polling in swing districts has stabilized, and they feel energized by the news Friday that the FBI is looking into emails that could be related to its previously close investigation of Hillary Clinton's private server.' 
'Hillary Clinton's campaign has nearly taken up residence in North Carolina, strategically eyeing what it calls the 'Checkmate State' as a way to soundly block Donald Trump's path to the presidency' [ RealClearPolitics ]. As we wrote yesterday . 
The Trail 
I expected the Clinton campaign to have pulled up its dump truck and unloaded some serious oppo Monday or today; but so far as I can tell, all we have are damp squibs (1) and (2). Clearing the way for Wikileaks on Wednesday? 
(1) 'Why Trump's Russian server connection is less suspicious than it sounds' [ Engadget ]; Franklin Foer's original piece of crap piece here, in the Jeff Bezos Shopper's lifestyle insert (I'm not dignifying it with square brackets because the reaction by tech twitter is universally derisive). 
(2) 'Donald Trump Used Legally Dubious Method to Avoid Paying Taxes' [ New York Times ]. 'Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr. Trump's tax avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time.' I've helpfully underlined the weasel phrase. 
Democrat Email Hairball 
'Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, last year signed a $7,000-a-month contract with the foundation of a major Clinton donor who made a fortune selling a type of mortgage that some critics say contributed to the housing collapse, hacked emails show' [ Politico ]. How cozy! 
' Forget the FBI cache; the Podesta emails show how America is run' [Thomas Frank, Guardian ]. 
[T]he emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by WikiLeaks from the hacked account of Hillary Clinton's campaign chair John Podesta. They are last week's scandal in a year running over with scandals, but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal: they are a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers. 
The class to which I refer is not rising in angry protest; they are by and large pretty satisfied, pretty contented. Nobody takes road trips to exotic West Virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live; on the contrary, they are the ones for whom such stories are written. This bunch doesn't have to make do with a comb-over TV mountebank for a leader; for this class, the choices are always pretty good, and this year they happen to be excellent. 
They are the comfortable and well-educated mainstay of our modern Democratic party. They are also the grandees of our national media; the architects of our software; the designers of our streets; the high officials of our banking system; the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or fine-tune the Middle East with precision droning. They are, they think, not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones, the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves. 
The good people. 
Stats Watch 
Purchasing Managers' Manufacturing Index, October 2016: 'A marked upturn in new orders leads a very positive manufacturing PMI' [ Econoday ]. 'The increase in orders is centered in domestic demand though export orders also improved. Backlogs are another plus, rising to the best level in three months…. Based on this report, the manufacturing sector, after a flat year, is now accelerating into year end.' But: 'There is nothing in the ISM or Markit reports that would leave one to think manufacturing is on the mend' [ Econintersect ]. 
Institute For Supply Management Manufacturing Index, October 2016: 'ISM's manufacturing sample reported no better than moderate conditions [below consensus]. But new orders are a disappointment, still showing monthly growth but at a much slower rate' [ Econoday ]. 'The construction sector, despite unusually low mortgage rates, has been struggling this year with the softness in single-family housing posing continued challenges for what is otherwise a strong new home market.' And: ' ISM employment index is not useful in understanding manufacturing jobs growth. The ISM employment index appears useful in predicting turning points which can lead the BLS data up to one year' [ Econintersect ]. 
New Normal: 'Another factor, too, is the productive capacity that was built up to support a consumption engine that is no longer running at full tilt. Companies have more equipment and infrastructure than they are currently using, and with unused capacity, there is little reason to invest in new equipment or technologies. This helps explain the weak rate of capital spending in GDP – and may also help answer the vexing question of why productivity gains are so anemic. After all, productivity might be enhanced by innovation, which requires research and investment' [ Econintersect ]. 
Construction Spending, September 2016: 'Construction spending remains weak but indications on housing do show limited improvement' [ Econoday ]. And: 'well below the consensus forecast' [ Econintersect ]. But: 'Overall, however – construction is now contracting after spending nearly 5 years expanding year-over-year. Still note that the rolling averages did improve' [ Econintersect ]. 'But the confusion is that construction spending does not correlate to construction employment – casting doubt on the validity of one or both data sets.' 
Housing: 'Nearly half of the homes purchased in major cities in Florida are all cash buyers. Cleveland is also seeing nearly half of all home purchases being made with all cash' [ Doctor Housing Bubble ]. The 'All Cash Buyer Percentage' in Miami is 54% (!), and in Los Angeles 20%. Cleveland, 45% and Pittsburgh, 42%. 
Coops: 'Today, National Cooperative Bank, known for providing banking solutions tailored to meet the needs of cooperatives nationwide, released its annual NCB Co-op 100®, listing the nation's top 100 revenue-earning cooperative businesses. In 2015, these businesses posted revenue totaling approximately $223.8 billion. The NCB Co-op 100® remains the only annual report of its kind to track the profits and successes of cooperative businesses in the United States' [ Market Wired (DB)]. See also this list of coop-oriented podcasts . 
Shipping: 'Study shows e-commerce consumers are loyal to UPS, USPS, and FedEx… in that order' [ DC Velocity ]. Non-union trails… 
Shipping: 'Developers are having a harder time finding space for new warehouses in increasingly crowded and expensive U.S. cities. Their answer: build upward' [ Wall Street Journal , 'Prologis to Build First Multistory Warehouse in the U.S.']. '[M]ultistory warehouses are already common in countries like Japan and Singapore, as well as elsewhere in Asia and Europe, where vacant land is harder to find. ' Like New England mills… 
Shipping: 'None of the world's biggest container-shipping companies is likely to post a profit this year, a top executive of French shipping giant CMA CGM said Monday' [ Wall Street Journal , 'Grim Year Forecast for Big Shipping Firms']. 
Shipping: 'A mainstay of the U.S. domestic shipping business is struggling to stay afloat. Lawyers who put International Shipholding Corp. into bankruptcy in July say they have a deal to bring the vessel owner's troubled operations under the umbrella of a larger Florida-based maritime services firm. International Shipholding's survival battle hasn't gotten the attention of bigger turmoil in the global shipping business, but the 69-year-old company's collapse highlights the impact that the downturn in demand is having across the entire shipping supply chain' [ Wall Street Journal ]. Wow. 
Shipping: 'The cascading of increasingly larger containerships from the Asia-Europe trade to smaller trades is set for a second, 'potentially more destructive', phase, with a new generation of ultra large container vessels moving into north-south lanes' [ Lloyd's List ]. 
Shipping: 'A giant fire engulfed a beached tanker today killing at least ten workers at the Gadani shipbreaking area in Pakistan injuring another 50' [ Splash 247 ]. 'A welding error led to a blast on the ship, which rapidly spread into a blaze with images and videos seen by Splash showing dark, vast plumes above the beached vessel.' 
Shipping: 'Over 90 percent of world trade moves by sea, but once cargo is on a ship, it enters a zone with little information about the path ships are taking or the stops they are making. Only in recent years have the largest ships begun regularly transmitting location data, and even now, a ship may stop its transmission and ‘go dark' at any time' [ MIT Technology Review ]. 
Honey for the Bears: 'Economic Planning Associates Inc.'s (EPA) latest freight rail-car forecast for total deliveries in 2016 has edged up to 61,800 units from 60,300 units. But, weakness in the market for certain cars has prompted the firm to lower its estimate for 2017' [ Progressive Railroading ]. Another straw in the wind for 2017. '‘Strength in box cars, hi-cube covered hoppers and mid-sized hoppers prompted EPA to increase this year's total delivery estimate. However, weaknesses in tank cars, coal cars, flat cars and mill gons will serve to lower 2017 assemblies to 41,000,' stated EPA's report, which was released yesterday. ‘After a further easing to 40,000 car deliveries in 2018, demand for rail cars will rebound on an annual basis, reaching 51,500 cars in 2021.'' 
Fodder for the Bulls: 'But as the year has progressed, worries about the state of the world's second-largest economy have abated as economic data have firmed. There's a bevy of evidence from domestic figures and other metrics sensitive to the state of the Chinese economy now showing that the nation isn't in the midst of a disruptive downturn' [ Bloomberg ]. 
Apparel: 'In an industry famous for shrouding the connection between what it costs to manufacture garments and accessories, and the price that consumers pay for those items, Everlane seemingly fills a void; hence, its success. Price transparency aside, on the heels an array of garment manufacturing-related tragedies in recent years and amongst a larger call – particularly from millennials – for more ethically sound garments, Everlane founder and CEO, Michael Preysman, a former Investment Associate, saw a business opportunity in ethically made clothing' [ The Fashion Law ]. 'In accordance with Everlane's motto, we ask: Why would a brand based on transparency not list its factories?… Making vague and unsubstantiated claims in lieu of providing cold hard facts is a common trend that runs through the Everlane model.' 
Commodities: 'BHP Billiton Ltd., the world's biggest miner, is hot for electric vehicles' [ Bloomberg ]. ''As you see more renewables and EVs, we also will see an impact on copper demand,' Fiona Wild, BHP's vice president, sustainability and climate change, said Tuesday at a conference in Shanghai hosted by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. ‘EVs at the moment have about 80 kilograms of copper in them. As they become more efficient, you see a greater amount of copper in those vehicles, so there's always upside for copper.'' NOTE: 'Bloomberg New Energy Finance' is listed on the cover of the McKinsey report on self-driving cars (PDF), whose infamous footnote 17 is analyzed here . They seem to have provided much of the data, including data for Exhibit 10. Talking their book? 
Commodities: 'A slump in demand for iron ore and coal in Europe has resulted in a marked decrease in dry bulk throughput at the Port of Rotterdam. In the first nine months of the year, it handled 60.3m tonnes of dry bulk, or 7.8% lower than the same period last year, the port said' [ Lloyd's List ]. 
The Bezzle: 'Racial and Gender Discrimination in Transportation Network Companies' [ National Bureau of Economic Research ]. 'Passengers have faced a history of discrimination in transportation systems. Peer transportation companies such as Uber and Lyft present the opportunity to rectify long-standing discrimination or worsen it. We sent passengers in Seattle, WA and Boston, MA to hail nearly 1,500 rides on controlled routes and recorded key performance metrics. Results indicated a pattern of discrimination, which we observed in Seattle through longer waiting times for African American passengers—as much as a 35 percent increase. In Boston, we observed discrimination by Uber drivers via more frequent cancellations against passengers when they used African American-sounding names. Across all trips, the cancellation rate for African American sounding names was more than twice as frequent compared to white sounding names.' 
Political Risk: 'Variations in the market's performance under Democratic and Republican administrations, measured by the average of yearly returns over more than 160 years, are so small as to be negligible, said Vanguard senior investment strategist Jonathan Lemco, a former professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University' [ Bloomberg ]. 'A recent survey did show that the election ;is causing U.S. voters high anxiety . ;But according to readings of the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, the level of market anxiety is pretty normal, said Lemco. Volatility 'hasn't exceeded normal levels for a presidential election year, and there is no indication that it will deviate from typical patterns after the election,' he wrote in a recent report .' 
'Issues about morality, the market, and the constitutional order should have been central to the policy debate about macroeconomics. They weren't. The standard policy frame eliminated them from discussion, causing a chasm in the policy debate in which the common framework shared by Keynes and Hayek disappeared' [ Evonomics ]. 'Market fundamentalists incorrectly were portrayed as heartless and uncaring about the poor by followers of Keynes. Keynesians were incorrectly portrayed as unthinking supporters of big government by followers of Hayek.

Big Brother Is Watching You Watch 
'How Despots Use Twitter to Hunt Dissidents' [ Bloomberg ]. For years, Twitter has offered access to its 'Firehose'—the global deluge of tweets, half a billion a day—to a number of companies that monitor social media. Some of those companies resell the information—mostly to marketers, but also to governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. Some of these authorities use the data to track dissidents, as Bloomberg Businessweek has learned through dozens of interviews with industry insiders and more than 100 requests for public records from law enforcement agencies in the U.S. There's nothing illegal about selling Twitter data, but it's uncomfortable for a company that promotes itself as a medium for free speech and protest.' One more reason Twitter should be a coop? 
Standing Rock and #NoDAPL 
'Did #DAPL Security Worker Wielding an AR-15 Rifle Try to Infiltrate Native Water Protectors?' [ Democracy Now!] ' More details are emerging from Thursday, including video footage of a man who appears to be a Dakota Access security contractor holding a rifle, with his face covered by a bandana, apparently attempting to infiltrate a group of water protectors. A Standing Rock Sioux tribal member says he saw the man driving down Highway 1806 toward the main resistance camp with an AR-15 rifle on the passenger side of his truck. Protectors chased down his truck and then pursued him on foot in efforts to disarm him. In the video, the man can be seen pointing the rifle at the protectors as he attempts to flee into the water. He was ultimately arrested by Bureau of Indian Affairs police. Protectors say inside the man's truck they found a DAPL security ID card and insurance papers listing his vehicle as insured by DAPL. ' 
Winter supplies for the protesters: Firewood is #1 [ Sacred Stone Camp ]. So if you've got a truck and a couple of cords… 
'How to Talk About #NoDAPL: A Native Perspective' [ Truthout ]. 'In discussing #NoDAPL, too few people have started from a place of naming that we, as Indigenous people, have a right to defend our water and our lives, simply because we have a natural right to defend ourselves and our communities. When ‘climate justice,' in a very broad sense, becomes the center of conversation, our fronts of struggle are often reduced to a staging ground for the messaging of NGOs.' 
'Dakota Access pipeline protests: UN group investigates human rights abuses' [ Guardian ]. '‘When you look at what the international standards are for the treatment of people, and you are in a place like the United States, it's really astounding to hear some of this testimony,' said Roberto Borrero, a representative of the International Indian Treaty Council.' 
'At least 1.3 million people had ‘checked in' to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation on Facebook as a show of support for activists trying to block the pipeline, after one user claimed that authorities were tracking protesters on social media. The Sheriff's Department said Monday that the claim was ‘absolutely false'' [ Los Angeles Times ]. So can I take that as a confirmation? Anyhow, ' strength of weak ties' with Facebook, but at least the logic is 'I am Spartacus!' 
Black Injustice Tipping Point 
'Like Abusive Policing, Denial of Access to Mortgage Credit for Black Americans is a Growing Crisis' [ Institute for New Economic Thinking ].

'As Senator John Sherman, the principal author of the nation's core antimonopoly law, put it more than a century ago, a monopoly ‘commands the price of labor without fear of strikes, for in its field it allows no competitors.'' 
News of the Wired 
Exhaustive compilation of reaction to the Apple MacBook Pro event [ Milen.me ]. 'From where I'm standing, Apple are redefining (shrinking) their target audience for the Mac platform. If you feel left out by the latest updates and the neglect on the desktop, it's simple as Apple deciding not to serve your segment's needs. I know that it can feel quite personal to Mac devotees, like me, but it's simply business and strategy.' In other words, the rollout wasn't a debacle; Apple has decided it doesn't want to serve the professional market any more (including, one would have thought critically, the market in content creation). Since the Mac accounts for 10% of Apple's revenues, that may be a rational business decision. But if Cook really thinks 'the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop' he's delusional, and I don't care if he paid for a marketing study. I own both and I know. The ultimate strength of the Mac was always the Human Interface Guidelines — gradually being crapified as iOS idioms infest OS X — which imposed a similar 'look and feel' across all applications that ran on the Mac platform. It would be nice if Ubuntu, say, could achieve the same thing. Sadly, that doesn't seem likely, for reasons both technical and cultural. My first Mac was a 512KE. It was a good run.

ARTICLE

by Yves Smith 
With all the big and small grifting that goes on in private equity, we haven't bothered calling out a practice that is pervasive and well known in the private equity community and authorized by the agreements that the limited partners sign with the general partners. Yet it will likely stick in the craw of most public pension fund beneficiaries, the taxpayers who support the payments to those plans, as well as donor to foundations and endowments that also invest in private equity even more than the widespread use of private jets, which is authorized not just for firm employees but at some general partners, even their family members. 
Another routine form of private equity rent extraction is how they get the fund investors, who are fiduciaries, to pay for lavish annual conferences which for the biggest funds includes big ticket entertainment like Elton John: #EltonJohn — TPG CEO Conference Phoenix AZ pic.twitter.com/gQWqkpPEwO 
— Doug Curling (@shakadoug) October 19, 2016 
And for the still skeptical, another source has confirmed that Elton John performed at the TPG conference. And as is typical in limited partnership agreements, investors are on the hook for the costs of 'meetings' and this show, as part of a limited partner event, was on their nickel. 
The only TPG limited partnership agreement we have is for a credit fund, and debt investors (unless they obtain control of a company via Chapter 11 or an out of court restructuring) do not have direct control over portfolio companies. That makes it harder for them to keep various charges opaque to limited partners by laundering them through portfolio companies. Nevertheless, the TPG Opportunities Partners II (A) puts the cost of meetings squarely on the investors. From numbered page 42, section 6.01(b): 
Except as specifically set forth in Section 3.01 ofthe Management Agreement, the Partnership shall pay for (or shall reimburse the Management Company for its payment of) all fees, costs and expenses relating to the Partnership's activities, operations, meetings (including Advisory Committee meetings)… 
And TPG's current Form ADV is even clearer on this point : 
…each Fund also generally bears all of the expenses relating to its activities, operations, meetings and eventual liquidation (other than expenses resulting from the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of us or its general partner), 
And the ADV also specifies that TPG can charge entertainment to portfolio companies, which means limited partners have no idea how large the charges are in total: 
…reimbursements from portfolio companies for expenses (including travel expenses, which include expenses for business or first class travel, 'black car' transportation and meals (including late night meals consumed at times when not traveling), entertainment-related expenses) we incur in connection with our performance of services for such portfolio company; 
Consider what this means. Private jet use supposedly OK not because it is an egregious perk for Masters of the Universe, but because their time is oh-so-valuable, and sometimes those mere commercial flights don't get from Awkward Point A to Awkward Point B all that efficiently. The other justification is the need for secrecy and the ability to work on a private jet. The latter claim is pretty dodgy in light of the widespread industry practice of offering empty seats to supposed competitors if they happen to need a lift. So private jet use is an occasionally-justifible practice that has become a bad norm. 
By contrast, it's hard to see lavish entertainment at supposed informational gatherings as anything other than a kickback to private equity investors. As someone who is in the business of consuming and analyzing information, it is vastly more efficient to process written information than speeches or presentations. Lambert and I both greatly prefer transcripts and can barely stand the time cost of listening to Web presentations. Conferences are an even bigger time sink. 
In other words, if the objective were to inform investors, these events are clearly not necessary. The limited partners are flattering themselves if they think they can learn anything more by seeing general partner execs or the team from their showcased portfolio companies in the flesh. These are all highly skilled performers and these events are very carefully staged in advance. 
So what are the limited partners getting? Aside from getting an excuse to visit New York, London, Phoenix, or other major destination, and getting wined and dined, the general partners are marketing to them. This is an extended sales pitch to help groom them to invest in the next fund. And secondarily, it's an opportunity to mix socially with other limited partners…which is questionable as a use of the funds entrusted to them. They can do that just as well at educational conferences, which are also neutral territory. 
Indeed, a former private equity fund executive pointed out that keeping private equity staff at pension funds and foundations busy with the nominally important work of running around to general partner meet and greets seriously eroded the time they could spend doing what ought to be their real work, of reading the financial information and other reports provided by the general partners as well as their SEC Form ADVs, which it appears virtually no one in the industry bothers scrutinizing. 
One academic told me that he'd only encountered one investor who regularly read the IPOs of companies sold out of funds they'd invested in to see if there was anything they hadn't anticipated so as to help them better evaluate future fund investments. Consistent with the thesis that general partner conferences were either by accident or design busywork to keep limited partners from digging into documents and data, this investor was in a remote part of Europe and didn't often go to investor confabs because the travel time was apparently too costly relative to the information yield. 
One has to wonder how popular these general partner conferences would be if they instead featured rubber-chicken dinners and focused on information conveyance. The INET conferences, which by contrast are primarily networking events, featured long days (8 AM to 10 PM, with the lunch and dinner speakers covering substantive topics) for years until the participants cried uncle and asked for a less exhausting schedule. And these are people who don't have billions of dollars of funds at risk. 
It's not hard to imagine that if the general partners were dispensing information, as opposed to using investor monies to curry favor with them, you'd see them using tried and true forms, like public company quarterly earnings calls. But as people trained in making presentations know, conventions like a darkened room, the use of visuals on screens, having speakers on daises, all give the speakers a power advantage over the audience and deter questions. A conference call would be a dangerous leveler. Can't have that, now can we? 
So expect this offensive form of grifting to continue. The old saying at CalPERS more than a decade ago was that the price of a $100 million commitment was a steak dinner. Imagine what seeing Elton John perform live buys. 0 0 0 0 0 2

by Outis Philalithopoulos By Outis Philalithopoulos, who met an untimely end five years ago, and now 'wears the chains he forged in life' as an economist. In the previous episode of this series , the ghost Outis was guided by the Spirit of Liberalism Past to 1996, where a younger Outis had gone to hear a popular liberal speaker. Afterward, his girlfriend Corinne was eager to catch a talk by a postmodern scholar she held in high esteem; eventually, Outis agreed to come along. The speaker was a critical theory/political science professor named Wendy Brown, and she was presenting themes from her recent book, States of Injury . I tried to keep from glancing over at where Corinne and the young Outis were sitting. But my mind kept wandering, and Brown's style hardly aided my efforts to stay focused on her lecture. The first ten minutes of her talk were spent explaining why her book had notbeen written, the boundaries it would not respect, how not only the first description she gave of her book but also the second were 'disingenuous,' with such a cascade of negations that her prefatory remarks alone contained 2 no 's, 2 neither 's, 9 not 's, and 6 nor 's. To me, it all started to seem hazy, but my ghostly companion must have been enjoying himself. A person listening to Brown might have imagined that human thought was one colossal debate between Marx, Nietzsche, and Foucault, with Max Weber and Jean Baudrillard in supporting roles. Meanwhile, the unappeased menace of Catharine McKinnon lurked on the horizon. But then, something in what Brown was saying started to sound familiar: Postmodern power is often characterized as decentered and diffuse even while it incessantly violates, transgresses, and resituates social boundaries; it […] irrigates through networks rather than consolidating in bosses and kings […] We are today very susceptible to simply getting lost […] insofar as being lost means being without (fixed) means of orientation […] Brown was describing a disorienting world without clear standards of truth. But did she mean that the world was naturally like this, as Foucault seemed to believe, or did she see this 'postmodern condition' as something the system had inflicted upon everyone, upon Allan Bloom as well as upon Al Franken? In our efforts to 'cope' with our 'lost' condition in postmodernity, Brown explained that one strategy was fundamentalism, or 'reactionary foundationalism.' Quoting Feher and Heller, Postmodern Political Condition : fundamentalists select one aspect of the dogma, one 'text of foundation' with regard to which they declare all attempts at hermeneutics politically subversive. That did sound like the fundamentalists I'd seen on TV. 'What's hermeneutics?' I whispered to Foucault. 'Interpretation,' he whispered back. Brown had more to say about fundamentalism. Reactionary foundationalism is not limited to the political or intellectual Right, but emerges across the political spectrum from those hostile to what they take to be postmodern politcal decay and intellectual disarray. What? Apparently others were startled as well, because she immediately followed up on her point. When these precepts 'without which we cannot survive' issue from the intellectual or political Right, they are easy enough to identify as both reactionary and fundamentalist. It is fairly clear what they oppose and seek to foreclose: inter alia , democratic conversation about our collective condition and future. But when they issue from feminists or others on the 'Left,' they are more slippery, especially insofar as they are posed in the name of caring about political things, caring about ' actual women' or about womens's ' actual condition in the world' […] So: the Right is trying to stop us from thinking democratically about the future, and the Left cares about real problems and real women – so why is it a problem that we believe that we are right? I want to suggest that much North Atlantic feminism partakes deeply of […] ressentiment and that this constitutes a good deal of our nervousness about moving toward an analysis as thoroughly Nietzschean in its wariness about truth as postfoundational political theory must be. Whoa, whoa, whoa. How are we swimming in ressentiment ? Doesn't she mean right wingers ? Why should our analysis be thoroughly Nietzschean? Why should it be 'wary' about the truth? Why feminists? What [is it about] identity's desire for recognition that seem[s] often to breed a politics of recrimination and rancor, of culturally dispersed paralysis and suffering […]? I found Brown hard to understand. And the things I did understand, I wasn't sure I liked. She closed by saying that the Left should give up substituting Truth and Morality for politics. Are we willing to engage in struggle rather than recrimination, to develop our faculties rather than revenge our subordination with moral and epistemological gestures, to fight for a world rather than conduct process on the existing one? The audience began to applaud, who knows with how much sincerity. I was annoyed, and I knew one person who I was pretty sure had understood the talk better than I had. 'Michel,' I said urgently. He turned to me. 'There are two things I don't understand. First, Brown criticizes the Left for believing in myths like 'truth is always on the side of the damned and excluded,' and 'truth is clean of power and always positioned to reproach power,' and advocates instead 'living and working without such myths, without insisting that our truths are less partial and more moral than theirs.' 'Yes,' Foucault agreed. 'But isn't she insisting precisely that her postmodern, Nietzschean ideas about politics and rhetoric are less mythical, more true than those of the less reflective people she criticizes?' 'Ah,' he said. 'I understand. And your other question?' 'When she says we need to do all these things, give up on ressentiment , make our analysis more Nietzschean, stop talking about absolute truth – why should we? Once you and she demonstrate to everyone that morality and truth are inseparable from power, and people merely engage in 'wars of position' and 'amoral contests about the just and good' – why would anyone bother to use postmodernist rhetoric?' 'Well…' he began. I cut him off, with some heat. 'Why wouldn't they just continue to talk about morality and truth the way they do now? If all that matters is winning, and morality and truth help one side to win, then according to you , why care if they are myths?' 'Right,' Foucault said, his eyes sparkling. 'About those two questions…' He was not alarmed by my questions in the least, and I feel sure he would have addressed my doubts. But I stopped paying attention to him as Corinne and the young Outis walked toward me. The moment I had been dreading had come. Corinne's eyes were shining. 'Did you see what she was saying? Wasn't it brilliant? And she's so courageous, willing to criticize even Left political movements that she identifies with…' Outis looked reluctant to disappoint her. 'She's definitely very intelligent… It's just that…' Corinne froze. 'What?' she said in a suddenly much more subdued voice. He seemed to be gathering his courage. 'It's just that I don't see why it has to be so complicated. Why can't she just say what we ought to do?' Corinne retorted, 'But don't you see – that's the problem. Smart people have always been trying to tell people what is true and what to think. It's a form of power. And she doesn't want to fall into that trap.' 'Right,' Outis said, 'but it feels like she sees the whole world as ringed by traps, so that everything a person could possibly say might somehow be wrong.' 'But Outis,' Corinne said, 'lots of things people say really are problematic. Lots of times their wording shows habits of thought that are precisely the ones we can recognize as having underpinned horrible things like colonialism.' 'Does that mean we're all going to have to talk like her ?' Outis muttered. 'What do you mean, like her ? What's so bad about the way she talks?' 'It's like she believes we're all under surveillance by a Great and Powerful Monster. And so she has to speak in code so that that neither the Monster nor anyone else will be able to prove that she's opposing it.' 'You're making it sound completely childish!' Corinne said with indignation. 'Well, maybe it is!' Outis said, his voice rising. I turned to the Spirit in anguish. 'Leave me!' I cried. 'Take me back, haunt me no longer!' He looked at me with surprising gentleness in his eyes. 'There are two shadows more,' he said, 'that you must see; and yet, a respite will give you space to consider the points of fixity, of immobilization, in your position, so you can begin to see them as elements in a strategy…' And with these words, he and everything else vanished, and I found myself alone in the abyssal vale. There were things then that I did not wish to remember, and I forced my mind onto other topics. 'Postmodernism,' I repeated darkly to myself. Even the word sounds pretentious. What does it mean, anyway? It seemed to be in opposition to 'modernism,' which in turn meant how people in the early twentieth century often believed that humanity could work toward absolute truth, and that current Western society represented the culmination of historical progress. For reasons Brown seemed to think were obvious, modernism was not good, and so it had been replaced by the 'postmodernism' that had bestrode the academic world like a colossus. Postmodernist irony, cultural relativism, skepticism about objective truth – in various guises, these could be seen not only in Foucault and Brown, but also in Franken, and echoes of it were present in Bloom's critique. So who killed it? And why was its death a secret? If the most brilliant liberals of the 1990s had been convinced that all attempts to establish absolute truth were fundamentally flawed and problematic, how had we solved the problem and successfully created a set of fixed reference points for orienting ourselves? Had we, paraphrasing Feher and Heller, chosen a dogma and 'declared all attempts at interpreting it critically to be subversive'? * * * In the next episode, Outis moves closer to the present, and watches as the outlines of modern progressivism become more discernible.

Jerri-Lynn here: The following post summarizes the state-of-play regarding production cutbacks for twelve oil-producing states invited to participate in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) ongoing discussions regarding a much-anticipated output freeze. As the post suggests, failure to agree restrictions and stabilize prices might heighten the risks of terrorist attacks and political instability in some of the non-OPEC countries invited to participate in wider negotiations. Yet inviting new participants to the negotiating party is only likely to complicate the situation and slow further the implementation of an internal production reduction already delayed for nearly a year. 
By Zainab Calcuttawala, an American journalist based in Morocco. She completed her undergraduate coursework at the University of Texas at Austin (Hook'em) and reports on international trade, human rights issues and more. Originally published at Oilprice.com 
Last week, Venezuelan oil minister Eulogio del Pino released a list of states invited to participate in the OPEC ongoing negotiations regarding a much-anticipated output freeze. 
Russia, Egypt and ten other oil exporters made the list, though the high variation between the economic and political standings of the non-OPEC participants add to the already complicated and delicate orchestration of the deal— if there is to be a deal, that is. 
This past weekend, several of the invited non-OPEC countries sent representatives to Vienna for consultations regarding the terms of a potential freeze deal. No details have been finalized, but those who participated agreed to meet again before the 30 November OPEC summit. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Energy Minister Alexander Novak have recently agreed to freeze output in coordination with OPEC, if the group's members can flesh out a plan amongst themselves. 
According to OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo, the bloc is on track to deliver a deal by the end of November. Barkindo also said that Russia has agreed to participate in OPEC's official meeting this month. 
As outlined by the Jamestown Foundation last month, Kazakhstan is desperate for a freeze deal to help economic development rebound to the 6-7 percent expansion rate that the former Soviet Republic saw when barrel prices exceeded $100. But just because they are desperate for a cut doesn't mean they will participate. 
Kazakh Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev said on Tuesday that Kazakhstan itself would not be doing any cutting, because, according to Bozumbayev, their production levels are small in proportion to some of the others at the negotiating table, namely Russia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Iran, and Mexico. 
This year, Kazakhstan does not expect its economy to grow more than 0.1 percent, while 2017 forecasts from the World Bank predict a low one-percent increase in GDP. Kazakhstan – which recently reopened its Kashagan field, depends on oil exports for over 60 percent of total government revenues and a quarter of its GDP. 
A failed deal could mean renewed terrorist attacks and political instability for Kazakhstan as the Kazakh economy continues to spiral downwards. 
Asked what he hoped Saturday's meeting would achieve, a Kazakh official in attendance in Vienna desperately said: 'We just hope the price will react and it will increase.' That desperation is shared by many other oil-dependent countries, but this desperation is also a sign that these countries are not in any position to scale back the production that generates the most revenue. 
Azerbaijan was also at the table. Halfway through October, Azerbaijan – a country that produced more than half of the world's oil a century ago – also announced its support of an OPEC/non-OPEC cut, which, as ClipperData noted , is convenient because the country's September oil production was 10.2 percent lower than its August rate. 
'Venezuela and Azerbaijan agree that some measures will be taken to stabilize the market,' Azeri Energy Minister Natig Aliyev said this weekend. 'We agreed the price of oil can be around $60 per barrel.' Statements revolving around price, however, do not speak to who is ready to share the burden of cutting production, and do little to assuage market fears that a cut is but a wispy goal. 
Oman wasn't buying the feasibility of OPEC cuts either, and before the Algiers meeting in September, Oman said as much, stating that it did not believe in the bloc's ability to solve the pricing crisis due to several failed efforts to freeze output over the past year. 
Newer reports on Oman show that they officially support an output freeze and overall reduction, with the expectation that 'similar measures be taken by other countries.' It remains unclear if Iraq, a war-torn nation currently defying production limits, and Iran, a country trying to regain its legs now that sanctions were lifted, count as one of the 'other countries' that Oman expects to cut output. 
As a net oil importer, Egypt does not have the market power or political capital to sway the momentum of a freeze one way or another. The North African country's recent spat with Saudi Arabia – the de facto leader of OPEC – over suspended petroleum shipments will also limit the salience of Egyptian interests in the bloc's proceedings. 
Sources from the Egyptian Parliament say the country's energy ministry will be asked to review Saudi Aramco's five-year agreement to supply Egypt with petroleum derivatives in the coming weeks, further complicating relations between the two nations. 
Ninety-nine percent of Canadian oil exports go straight to the United States, according to governmental data from the buyer and seller countries. 
Neither of the two North American countries is part of OPEC, and they have their own agreements for energy supplies. So even though Canada has been invited to participate in the freeze talks, the country does not have the economic or political incentive to reduce output. 
Brazil elected to 'observe' Saturday's meeting as the country prepares to increase production rates over the next few years. This makes them extremely unlikely participants in any efforts to scale back production. 
Other countries present this weekend included Mexico, which has spent the better part of this summer building a hedge against low oil prices for the next fiscal year. 
Small-scale producers such as Bolivia and Trinidad and Tobago have already turned down production over the past two years, which had a limited effect on market fundamentals. 
Norway, a 1.6 million barrel per day producer that has increased output by 2.1 percent in 2014 and 3.08 percent in 2015, declined to meet with OPEC over the weekend. 
The geopolitics of oil within OPEC has already delayed the implementation of an internal production reduction for almost an entire year. By adding new nations from previously uninvolved continents (North America and Europe), the bloc has flooded the negotiation table with new interests – creating a fresh slate of diplomatic obstacles to overcome before an output freeze can be implemented. 0 0 0 0 0 0

Financial markets jolted as US election polls tighten FT 
Democratic Voters Are to Blame for Hillary Clinton's Headaches The New Republic. So, it's all the fault of voters, for not bothering to vote in 2014. Which raises the obvious question: If the DNC ran better candidates, would voters perhaps be inspired to turn out? Or, to push the point a bit further, as Brecht expressed it: 
Some party hack decreed that the people had lost the government's confidence and could only regain it with redoubled effort. If that is the case, would it not be simpler, If the government simply dissolved the people And elected another?

Jerri-Lynn here. Normally, I would not post another Real News Network interview with Colin Powell's former chief of staff when he was Secretary of State, Tom Wilkerson so close to Yves posting Is the US Headed Towards War in Syria? , another interview with the same subject just last week. Yet given the urgency of the topic, reader interest in last week's post, and the perhaps Panglossian hope that high-level focus on this issue now might limit the range of future options that hawkish Hillary Clinton can take in future– in what I must admit still looks to be the likeliest scenario, that she is inaugurated come January– I upload this post. Perhaps if the Obamamometer took time off from his rounds of legacy-burnishing interviews and concentrated on this problem, he might have a chance of correcting one specific aspect of his horrendous existing foreign policy legacy before the clock runs out on his administration. 
This Real News Network interview with Lawrence Wilkerson , offers some suggestions on what would be necessary to stop the immediate ongoing slaughter and reach a peaceful solution in the longer term. It's by no means the most comprehensive nor the last word on the subject. I cleaned up the rush transcript as best I could. Please excuse any remaining errors. 
SHARMINI PERIES, TRNN: Welcome to the Real News Network. I'm Sharmini Peries coming to you from Baltimore. As the civil war in Syria rages on, a school was struck in an airstrike in a rebel held area of northern Syria last week. Reports indicate that 22 children died in the attack along with several civilians. The Russians who are supporting Syria's president al-Assad denied any involvement in the strike. There's also much speculation that Russians were not reelected to the UN Human Rights Council last Friday because of its involvement in Syria. But this is not known for certain since nations do not need to disclose why they choose to reject candidates for the council. Also last week, Amnesty International released a report in which it estimates that US-led coalition airstrikes in Syria have killed at least 300 civilians. It suggests the US military must come clean on the casualties that they have caused. So far, the war in Syria has cost somewhere between 250 thousand and 400 thousand deaths and has created over 4 million refugees. The highly complicated conflict has increased tensions between the US and Russia and a ceasefire seems more remote than ever. 
Joining us now to take a closer look at the conflict and what is required to end this is Larry Wilkerson. Larry is a retired United States army soldier and former chief of staff to the United States Secretary of State, Colin Powell. Larry, it's so good to have you with us today. 
LARRY WILKERSON: Thanks for having me Sharmini. 
PERIES: So Larry, last week when we talked, you mentioned that Hillary Clinton's proposal to implement a no fly zone over Syria and what that would probably mean is that it would worsen the conflict. So then, what steps need to be taken by the US to bring this conflict to a peaceful resolution? 
WILKERSON: Sharmini, this is going to sound like the impossible but there are two steps that need to be taken right away, immediately. The first is a high-level policy step which says President Obama and his council of elders, his National Security Council, whatever, should decide that Bashar al-Assad does not have to go. I think from what we have seen, the United States continuing to insist that Bashar al-Assad being untenable– that is unacceptable as President Obama said it earlier– is simply a position that now is part and parcel to all this blood and carnage and treasure and lives and diaspora being caused. If you can't back up from a strategic error like this and count your loses and say okay I made a mistake. You don't have to publicly say that but you have to say that in the councils of government and you have to be able to say I'm going to rectify that mistake. I miscalculated. 
Bashar al-Assad has enormous support. He has support not just outside Syria from Iran and Russia and elsewhere. He has support from inside Syria. Significant support. Then you have to face the reality too that on the other side you are largely supporting your own enemy, Al Qaeda. No matter what you say about the CIA's ability to differentiate between so called moderate rebels and those of the Al Nusra Front and those of Al Qaeda affiliates, that is pure nonsense. The CIA does not have that kind of capability. It does not have that kind of discrimination. So, most of the people we are now arming to fight Assad look a lot like Al Qaeda to me. So, you've got to admit you've made two huge errors and you have to rectify those errors. Those are the steps you need to make immediately. 
PERIES: Now what's preventing them from doing that and is what you're proposing unrealistic in the US diplomatic and military milieu? 
WILKERSON: Unrealistic if you don't have the political will nor the political courage to pursue a rectification of your errors. But what is the consequence? The consequence is more death, more conflict, more destruction, more damage, more tragedy, more refugees, more making Jordan unstable, and so forth. You've got to be able to back up from these strategic errors and instead of doing what throughout history, bad leaders have done, that is reinforce the strategic error until it becomes catastrophic, you've got to reverse it. And you've got to replace it with a better policy. You've got to force Saudi Arabia, you've got to force the Qataris, you've got to force the Turks however way you may do it. Economic, political, financial, whatever, you've got to force them to follow you. They don't have to follow you like lapdogs but at least they do have to recognize your change in policy and begin to at least for appearance's sake, support it. 
If the United States were to leave I think the rest of them would, reluctantly somewhat, follow in domain. What does that mean? That means you quit supplying these opposition forces with the massive arms that we are supplying them with. That includes anti-tank missiles and other elements. They're just going to make them go on and on and on. After all, Iran and Russia and Syria had an inexhaustible [coffers] of the kind of equipment that they need to oppose us as we do to oppose them. So, what are we doing here? We're having a great power confrontation over the graves and the blood of the Syrian people. This just simply has to stop. 
PERIES: Now in the past, Larry you said that Israel seems to be playing a contradictory role in Syria's conflict. If one is to believe that Israel actually prefers Assad to be in power than an Islamic regime there, would it not make sense for US to do what you're saying? To reassess and take a step back and keep Assad in power? 
WILKERSON: I think I'd have to say the contrary is operating right now Sharmini. Michael Horne has said point blank, he has that Israel would rather when I say Israel, let me be more precise, Bibi Netanyahu and Bibi Netanyahu's government would rather see ISIS in command, Al Qaeda in command in Damascus, than they would Bashar al-Assad. So, that's what we're up against here. But I don't think we're up against the Israeli people. If the Israeli people were confronted with the reality of this chaos and this collapse of nations all around them, it's more detrimental to their long-term security than coming to some accommodation with these countries and helping them come back to some reasonable degree of stability and political feasibility, I think it'd get a change of attitude in Israel. 
But no one's telling them the truth. Everyone is scaring them and everyone is saying well you've got to keep these people in chaos. You've got to keep them on the verge of collapse if not collapsing. You've got to change these regimes and it would be better to have ISIS in charge in Damascus rather than have Assad. Just think how preposterous that is and yet that's what's being said. 
PERIES: Now in the last few weeks Larry, we've seen the battle of Aleppo covered extensively in the media. However there's another battle going on in Mosul similar in that sense in terms of the number of people that its attacking and very devastating there as well but very little attention in the media about what's happening in Mosul. What is going on there and what's the comparison here? 
WILKERSON: Well the media in this country don't care about this place Sharmini. They don't care about anything but Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and how big Kim Kardashian is today. What's happening in Mosul is in one sense a tactical defeat and maybe even an operational and maybe even strategic defeat for the group known as ISIS, ISIL and their ideal of upholding territory. It's going to happen in Mare'. They're going to be roundly defeated with regard to that aspect of their strategy. But what's going to happen in Mosul afterwards is going to refer back to their previous comments just now Sharmini which are going to have happen in Mosul afterwards is going to be the Turks and the Iraqis confronting one another. 
Everyone has made it pretty clear that he's not going to respond to the Baghdad government's request for him to stay out of Mosul in any real way. You're going to have Kurds. You're going to have all manner of different groups that have sufficient power to contest power in Mosul after ISIS is kicked out. Then you're going to see the proof of the pudding with regard to whether Iraq stays a state as it is currently constituted, however fragile, or it goes into something else. Splinters into two or three or possibly even more states. And you're going to see whether or not the Kurds can be talked into an autonomous relationship with these countries rather than an independent country of their own or whether everyone in Turkey will bless any of that. 
So, you're going to have the aftermath of Mosul and the defeat of ISIL which I think is going to happen. You're going to have that aftermath determine the future of several countries in that region if not the future of the region for many years to come and it's going to be indicative of whether or not we're going to be able to politically, diplomatically, economically and otherwise forge some kind of stability, some kind of peace, some kind of prosperity for the many young people in the region and bring people home from places like Jordan and Lebanon. And put them back in their own homes in places like Libya and Syria and so forth. The proof of the pudding as I said is going to be in the aftermath of Mosul, not necessarily in the tactical battle occurring there right now. 
PERIES: Alright Larry, Ill let you go for now but looking forward to having you back next week. 
WILKERSON: Thanks. Take care. 
PERIES: And thank you for joining us on the Real News Network. 0 0 0 0 0 0 This entry was posted in Guest Post on

She also writes regularly about legal, political economy, and regulatory topics for various consulting clients and publications, as well as writes occasional travel pieces for The National . 
Since FBI Director James Comey's bombshell announcement Friday that the bureau was reviewing new evidence regarding Hillary Clinton's email tar baby, many questions have arisen– among the Naked Capitalism commentariat, as well as more widely– about the scope and details of the President's pardoning powers. There are a few things to clear up right away, because I've seen a considerable amount of misinformation bandied about as to what the United States Constitution permits. Readers will please indulge me if in the interest of keeping this post short and sweet, I don't debunk each and every wrong argument I've seen since Friday. If I responded to all the crazypants stuff out there– tempting as that might be– I'd never get to my main points. 
Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution says that the President 'shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment …' 
So allow me to summarize the salient points. 
Absolute Power, Can Neither Be Reviewed nor Overturned As a Matter of Law 
The President's pardoning power is absolute. Pardoning decisions are not subject to judicial review, nor can any individual pardon be overturned by an act of Congress. The pardoning power's also unlimited as to offenses against the United States, so in theory, at least as a matter of law, a President could pardon someone for committing any offense against the United States ( I leave to one side the question of whether such an action would be politically possible). A President could also, at least in theory, pardon him or herself– for anything except in cases of impeachment. 
No Indictment Necessary 
It's not necessary for someone to be charged or convicted of a crime against of the United States for the President to pardon that person. The most famous example of a President granting a pardon in a case where no indictment had been brought is President Gerald Ford's September 1974 pardon of Richard Nixon shortly after he resigned the office of President. Allow me to quote at length from Proclamation 4311 Granting Pardon to Richard Nixon : 
Richard Nixon became the thirty-seventh President of the United States on January 20, 1969 and was reelected in 1972 for a second term by the electors of forty-nine of the fifty states. His term in office continued until his resignation on August 9, 1974. 
Pursuant to resolutions of the House of Representatives, its Committee on the Judiciary conducted an inquiry and investigation on the impeachment of the President extending over more than eight months. The hearings of the Committee and its deliberations, which received wide national publicity over television, radio, and in printed media, resulted in votes adverse to Richard Nixon on recommended Articles of Impeachment. 
As a result of certain acts or omissions occurring before his resignation from the Office of President, Richard Nixon has become liable to possible indictment and trial for offenses against the United States. Whether or not he shall be so prosecuted depends on findings of the appropriate grand jury and on the discretion of the authorized prosecutor. Should an indictment ensue, the accused shall then be entitled to a fair trial by an impartial jury, as guaranteed to every individual by the Constitution. 
It is believed that a trial of Richard Nixon, if it became necessary, could not fairly begin until a year or more has elapsed. In the meantime, the tranquility to which this nation has been restored by the events of recent weeks could be irreparably lost by the prospects of bringing to trial a former President of the United States. The prospects of such trial will cause prolonged and divisive debate over the propriety of exposing to further punishment and degradation a man who has already paid the unprecedented penalty of relinquishing the highest elective office of the United States. 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GERALD R. FORD, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, pursuant to the pardon power conferred upon me by Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution, have granted and by these presents do grant a full, free, and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 20, 1969 through August 9, 1974…. 
What Can Congress Do? 
Article, section 4, of the US Constitution grants Congress the power to impeach any federal officeholder: 
The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. 
Further, note that, Article I, Section 1, specifies: 
The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present. 
Judgment in Cases of Impeachments shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States, but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment, and Punishment, according to Law. 
A few considerations to note here, even though an extended discussion of impeachment is beyond the scope of this post. First, impeachment is a political process, with the penalty (to reiterate from above) limited to 'to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States.' A party that has been convicted by the Senate in an impeachment proceeding 'shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment, and Punishment, according to Law.' 
Second, although we're all well aware of the history of impeachment proceedings and the presidency (e.g., involving Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton), Congress can actually pursue impeachment proceedings against all civil officers of the United States. And in fact, there's a long common law tradition of such proceedings. I mention impeachment only in passing because such power lurks in the background, particularly in divided government situations– but I defer a more comprehensive discussion of impeachment issues in the current context until we know who has been elected President, and what the partisan composition of each house of Congress will be. 
What Will the Obamamometer Do? 
Back to the pardoning question. So, now that I've outlined the constitutional authority for pardoning, the main issue I wish to address is: What Will the Obamamometer do? 
On first glance, it's obvious that a President who has been, at least to my mind, unduly concerned with his legacy, and who also fetishizes the concept of bipartisanship, would not want to touch the issue of pardoning Hillary Clinton with a barge pole. I should also point out that the Obamamometer has been an unusually timid politician, and has often articulated soaring rhetoric that's never backed by bold action. In other words, all hat, not cattle. 
What the Obamamometer wil do, I believe, hinges on the outcome of the election. 
If Hillary Clinton Wins 
If Hillary wins next Tuesday, I believe the Obamamometer will not grant her a pardon, for the simple reason that she won't ask for one. To accept a pardon from Obama would be tantamount to an admission of guilt for her email practices, the Clinton Foundation's activities, , influence peddling, and pay-to-play, among other issues . 
Hillary Clinton as President can probably get away with foregoing a pardon, at least with respect to herself. After all, does anyone seriously believe that she will nominate candidates for high-level Department of Justice positions that will vigorously pursue investigations into her and hear activities prior to becoming President? I don't think so. 
The more interesting question is whether she'll be able to contain investigations that have already started and will no doubt draw in members of her inner circle. I'm going to put these questions aside for the time being– I promise readers I will revisit them if they're not moot, after the election. But in the interests of keeping this post short, and confining its focus on the main question at hand– the Obamamometer's options– I'm not going to delve further into these issues now. 
If Donald Trump Wins 
If Donald Trump wins, we're in a completely different ballpark. 
Trump promised in the second debate to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's (alleged) corruption (although I think the Wikileaks revelations should dispense with the need to put in an alleged, even in parenthesis). I believe he will have to follow through on this pledge. His smart move would be to ask his Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor– nominally a Democrat– who has extensive experience investigating complex financial frauds, misuse of information, and influence peddling. And if Hillary Clinton also understands this to be Trump's next move, this would leave her in the market for a pardon. 
Now, there's a lot of chatter out there that suggests the Clintons hate the Obamas and that the Obamas hate the Clintons. I've also heard it said that they're all great pals. 
For the purposes of my argument, however, it really doesn't matter one way or the other. I think Hillary will ask for a pardon, and the Obamamometer will grant it. It will be justified on the grounds that she's suffered enough in losing the election, and that she's been the subject of an unprecedented political vendetta. The Democratic nomenklatura laid the groundwork for this point in the immediate aftermath of the second debate, where Trump was lambasted for calling for appointing a special prosecutor, if he were elected, into Clinton's activities. This pledge was taken as a beyond-the-pale statement of vindictiveness rather than as a logical follow-through to investigations launched during the administration of a President of the same party as the candidate, into serious allegations involving mishandling of classified information and other offences. And I might add, Comey's late innings interjection should suggest that these investigations were neither comprehensively conducted, nor concluded. 
Given that Trump's next move is fairly obvious, I predict that the Obamamometer's is too. Hillary will seek, and he will grant, a pardon, while promoting the line that she's suffered enough in not getting her turn to be President, and that further, she's exposed to extreme vindictiveness from Team R. The unlikely outcome of a Trump victory will undoubtedly shake up the political, economic and cultural elite. It will trigger widespread concern that they might have to pay for their past sins. In order to forestall the possibility that punishment will indeed be meted out to fit crimes, wagons will be circled. The Obamamometer covets a reserved place at the top table, and to attain that, will have to deliver on a solution, and protect poor Hillary. Otherwise, no more summers on the Vineyard. 
The more interesting question is how far the Obamamometer's pardoning power will extend: will he provide get-out-of-jail free cards to Huma Abedin, John Podesta, Doug Brand, Cheryl Mills, any other Clinton minions, even the Big Dog himself? (I do of course realize Bill is probably untouchable). I don't think so. Because although I have and will continue to criticize the Obamamometer for being politically timid– not to mention intellectually not all he's been touted as being– I don't think he's personally corrupt in the narrow influence peddling sense. So let's hope he takes the legacy stuff seriously enough to hold the line at a tightly-drawn pardon for Hillary only, in the unlikely event Trump wins next week. 
As for the broader political issues– what Congress will do to address these issues– these will depend on the election results. Again, I defer further analysis until we see the election returns.

TPP, TTIP, TISA 
CETA: A week of pressure from four Belgian regions opposed to CETA, led by the courageous Walloons, produced a revised 'joint interpretive instrument' and, importantly, a new list of conditions that must be met before Belgium can ratify the deal' [ Rabble.ca ]. 'Unfortunately, the joint interpretive 'instrument' is mostly artful deception. To take just one example, the instrument's affirmation of the right to regulate is meaningless. Of course, the parties have not entirely given up their right to regulate. But the fact is, even if the instrument had full legal force under international law, CETA would still threaten the ability of Canada or EU governments to regulate in the public interest, enhance public services, and hold multinational companies accountable for their actions. 'The critical point missing,' as we wrote previously, 'is that while the parties retain the right to regulate, they must do so in conformity with their CETA obligations and commitments.'' So it will be interesting to see if Obama tries a similar deception on TPP. But wait! 
Wallonia's principled stand did, however, produce some important results. While most of the media attention in Canada appears to have focused on the joint instrument, the more interesting and potentially significant development may be the accord between Belgian governments that spells out the grounds for Belgium's federal government to sign CETA. 
For example, Belgium will now ask the European Court of Justice to give an opinion on the legality of CETA's investment court system within the EU. Even more importantly, four of Belgium's regional governments also state that they reject CETA (notably its investment chapter) as negotiated and that Belgium will refuse to ratify the treaty unless these concerns are addressed. In other words, while Belgium is now in a position to sign CETA, it will not be able to ratify the deal as it stands. 
This means that CETA's investment chapter, at a minimum, must be revised or the investment court system scrapped, before CETA can be ratified by Belgium. The accord also includes assurances that if any Belgian regional government refuses to ratify CETA, the federal government must give notice to the EU that Belgium cannot ratify, an act that could potentially trigger the end of CETA's provisional application in all European member states. 
The German constitutional court staked out a similar position in the event that Germany fails to ratify CETA. That decision, by the way, will not be made by the German government alone, but in conjunction with Germany's second chamber, which is currently controlled by the anti-CETA Greens and Left parties. 
So while CETA proponents have undoubtedly cleared a big albeit unanticipated hurdle in getting the deal signed, their machinations may have made CETA's full ratification even less likely. CETA's passage in Europe is far from assured, despite the apparent breakthrough in Belgium. 
And then there is the voice of the Canadian establishment– 
CETA: 'CETA puts Canada's trade debate to rest once and for all' [ Globe and Mail ]. 'The rationale for launching CETA in Canada was in large part to establish a measure of diversification from the country's trade relations within the North American free-trade agreement. Given the tone around trade in the U.S. presidential election, this decision now looks especially prescient.' 
CETA: 'What the Canada-EU Deal Means for the Future of Trade' [ Fortune ]. 'All of the factors that drove Europe to conclude this agreement provide insights for current trade challenges in the U.S. President Obama is trying to get Congress to approve just after the presidential election the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement… Now is the time to resolve as many specific congressional objections to the deal as possible. It is impossible to renegotiate the TPP in the time available, so as with the last-minute negotiations between the EU and Belgium, both the administration and Congress will need to be pragmatic and come to an agreement quickly on outstanding issues.' 
TISA: 'The 21st round of negotiations for the Trade in Services Agreement kicks off this morning in Geneva, and stakes are high for significant progress to be made this round in order for the deal to wrap up by its early December deadline. Significant issues remain, including data flows — where the European Union is still working to come up with a consolidated position — and new services, on which the EU and others are continuing to push for the right to apply different regulations to domestic and foreign constituents rather than afford the same treatment to all TISA partners. The round is scheduled to last through Nov. 10' [ Politico ]. 
2016 
Days until: 5. That's not very many days! 
Debates 
'Presidential Candidates Dr. Jill Stein & Gov. Gary Johnson [Pt. 1]' [ Tavis Smiley ]. A forum-style 'conversation' between the two. 
''I had a team of people who were relentless, totally in the head of what Trump might do,' [Hillary Clinton] says' [ People ] ''A lot of this comes down to who gets into whose head. It's like an athletic contest or maybe a high-stakes entertainment performance.' 
War Drums 
'In the five and a half years since the uprising in Syria began, it has become the most catastrophic war of our young century' [Dexter Filkins, The New Yorker ]. I would have thought that our invasion of Iraq in 2003 set the baseline for 'catastrophic'? What the heck was Filkins thinking when he wrote that sentence? And The New Yorker used to be famous for its fact-checking. When did that get crapified, anyhow? 
The Voters 
'[W]hile Trump and many of his supporters may fetishize a past that is deeply retrograde, liberals and progressives have also demonstrated a troubling tendency to fetishize a future that they presume is on their side. There's something peculiarly telling about this kind of progress fetishism, which has been conscripted as ideology-of-first-resort for Clintonite New Democrats' [ The Baffer ]. 'When our historical terrain has effectively focused most of our political energies to differentiating ourselves from the not-woke-enough opponents of progress, we can lose all critical introspection. We can uncritically pass over the fact that, say, liberal multiculturalism can end up being really racist , tolerance of queer sexualities can end up repackaging biologically determinist languages of eugenics, and so on. Moreover, as the rise of the New Democrats has made crystal clear (from Bill and Hillary to Obama), we will dependably base our biggest political choices on our future-focused need to have our place on the right side of history confirmed. So what if that means more drone strikes, deportations, mass incarceration of minorities, destructive free trade agreements, corporate concessions, and financial deregulation? It's messy 'maintaining' history, after all.' 
'Early Voting a Poor Predictor of Final Results' [ RealClearPolitics ]. One of several reasons: '[W]e don't know the effect to which campaign strategy is creating the appearance of a participation surge by merely cannibalizing Election Day voters by mobilizing voters who would have voted on Election Day anyway.' 
Downballot 
'The presidential race may be inducing whiplash, but the House battleground remains relatively stable in the final week. We rate only 40 House races in Lean or Toss Up, and Democrats would need to sweep 35 of them to win control, so Republicans remain overwhelming favorites to hold onto their majority. But there is still plenty of uncertainty about the size of that majority: Democrats could gain anywhere from 5 to 20 seats' [ Cook Political Report ]. ' Republican voters have begun coming home to Donald Trump amid the Comey news… Even if control is not at risk, the ultimate size of the GOP majority matters a great deal, especially to Speaker Paul Ryan. To the extent Republicans lose seats, almost all of the casualties will be swing-district moderates who are more loyal to Ryan than Trump. The narrower the majority, the less room for error Ryan will have in winning reelection to his position and navigating the 2017 legislative minefield.'

The Trail 
'SEPTA strike halts transit service in Philadelphia' [ Progressive Railroading ]. Effect on voting? 
'[T]he race between [Clinton and Trump] is now a precise dead heat in the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll, 46-46 percent. A majority, 55 percent, continues to expect Clinton to win, though that's down 5 points from its peak last week' [ ABC ]. ' Among other results is a gradual collapse in support for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, from a peak of 9 percent support in September to just 3 percent now. Jill Stein of the Green Party has 2 percent and has held steady.' Amazingly, Trump now leads on honesty and trustworthiness. Of course, it's madness to focus on individual polls; RCP's 4-way average has Clinton up by 1.9, though falling. 
'With the fallout over the FBI email probe continuing to take up oxygen, Trump has stayed uncharacteristically on message. Campaigning near Philadelphia on Tuesday, the GOP nominee and his running mate focused on the projected 25 percent average increase in premiums for some Affordable Care Act plans, as open enrollment began. Trump let Mike Pence do most of the talking, and the Indiana governor closed his remarks on repealing the law by asking Republicans to 'come home'' [ RealClearPolitics ]. Hitherto, Trump has been the anti-Napoleon, always interrupting his enemy when they are making a mistake. Not so this week (though there are 5 days to go). Kellyanne Conway must have gotten Trump's attention somehow. Or Ivanka. 
'Donald Trump Voters, Just Hear Me Out' [The Moustache of Understanding, New York Times ]. Four paragraphs in, he turns to the topic of Trump: 'Trump is not only a flawed politician, he's an indecent human being.' Persuasive! I dunno. If a vote for Trump would finally force Friedman off the Times Op-Ed page, would it be worth it? Tough call. 
Realignment 
'Will this be the election that finally kills off the Democratic and Republican parties?' [ McClatchy ]. 'Just days before Election Day, interviews with more than 40 independent voters in swing states underscores that the nomination of two deeply unpopular candidates for president is aggravating and reinforcing a growing trend in the country away from the Democratic and Republican parties, which more and more voters see as out of touch with their lives and out of date in a new century. The number of free agent voters registering as independent or unaffiliated is soaring, while Republican and Democratic numbers flatline. Independent registrations have jumped since 2008 by 22.3 percent in states that keep registration data by party. Democrats over that same time increased 2.7 percent and Republicans 3.6 percent…' 
'6 Reasons Why A New Civil War Is Possible And Terrifying' [ Cracked ]. ''Trust' isn't just an intangible concept when we're talking about the potential for civil warfare. Sinisa Malesevic is a professor who studies the sociology of civil wars and a survivor of the Yugoslavian civil war. He's someone Marvel really should've reached out to for script advice, and he noted the breakdown of trust was one of the first traumatizing steps to war, '… in a very short period of time, there is a complete sense of fear, you do not know who is who, who is supporting which side … that fear spreads.'' And: 'Colonel Couvillon also thought any conflict was likely to start in a rural area, '…people talk about, is it gonna be class warfare, race warfare … is it gonna be north versus south? Personally, I think it's gonna be urban versus rural.'' Another interesting piece from Cracked, of all places. 
Democrat Email Hairball 
'Opinion: Hillary Clinton is irreparably damaged, even if she wins' [ MarketWatch ]. '[W]e are in for a fiasco in politics that will make even this fiasco of a campaign pale by comparison. There is hardly any scenario that is too far-fetched. Even if the polls are right and Clinton's lead translates into an electoral victory, she will be so damaged going into office that her chances of getting anything done will be virtually nil. In this sense alone, Trump's claim that this scandal is 'worse than Watergate' could prove to be true. As an incumbent, Richard Nixon at least had an administration in place when he won re-election in 1972, though it took nearly another two years before he was forced to resign under threat of impeachment.' 
'U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said Monday he believes Hillary Clinton's actions with her private email server are impeachable offenses should she be elected president' [ Beloit Daily News ]. 'Johnson cited 18 U.S. Code 793 (f) and 18 U.S. Code 2071, which have to do with the willful destruction or removal from proper custody of information relating to national defense. Johnson honed in on the latter of the two, which reads in part that anyone found to have concealed or removed records 'shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.''I'm not a lawyer, but this is clearly written,' Johnson said. 'I would say yes, high crime or misdemeanor, I believe she is in violation of both laws.'' In principle, I agree. If a high official can privatize their communications, and then decide what to destroy and what to retain before turning them over to law enforcement, the term 'public records' becomes literally meaningless. Nixon, deep within his withered and wormy soul, retained a shred of conscience: He didn't simply destroy the tapes . Clinton would have destroyed the tapes without hesitation; in fact, that's exactly what she did with 'her'— that is, the public's — mail. 
'Wisconsin Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner told conservative radio host Charlie Sykes Tuesday that there would be a 'constitutional crisis' if Clinton was indicted, and when asked about impeachment, answered, 'I think that is something that is speculative in nature. I'm speculating, what I can say is that I think Richard Nixon would have been indicted and he would have been impeached. He stopped the impeachment by resigning as a result of Watergate and he stopped the indictment by President Ford pardoning him' [ CNN ]. On pardons, see Jerri-Lynn's post today . 
Stats Watch 
ADP Employment Report, October 2016: 'ADP sees significant softening for Friday's employment report, estimating October private payrolls will come in at 147,000' [ Econoday ]. 'Though ADP's revision does point to an upward revision to September's data in Friday's report, the October estimate is soft and could further lower expectations for a rate hike at today's FOMC meeting.' And but: ' ADP is showing jobs growth equalling the rate of people entering the jobs market. The growth this month is as Econintersect forecasted based on economic potential' [ Econintersect ]. 'ADP employment has not been a good predictor of BLS non-farm private job growth. 
Gallup U.S. Job Creation Index, October 2016: 'American workers' reports of hiring activity at their place of employment remained relatively strong in October, with many more saying their employer was adding rather than subtracting jobs' [ Econoday ]. 'For nearly all of Gallup's JCI trend since August 2008, net hiring in the private sector has far outpaced government net hiring. But the latest poll shows the narrowest gap between net hiring in the two sectors since April 2009, with nongovernment hiring (plus 32) essentially tied with government hiring (plus 31).' 
MBA Mortgage Applications, week of October 28, 2016: 'Purchase applications for home mortgages fell a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent in the October 28 week, following a sharp 7 percent decline in the prior week to the lowest level since January' [ Econoday ]. 
Shipping: 'US west coast employers and [ILWU and PMA] union leaders are to continue talks about extending the current employment contract covering dockworkers.The two sides met on Tuesday to discuss an extension beyond mid-2019 as part of an effort to restore confidence in ports along the Pacific seaboard' [ Lloyd's List ]. 
Shipping: 'Are conditions finally improving for the air cargo industry?' [ Air Cargo News ]. 'September market round-up shows that air cargo volume demand increased by 5% year on year in September — a level of increase not seen for two years. 'With such an increase in total weight transported, a further worldwide yield improvement over previous months, and industry sources claiming that October will be even better, one could be forgiven for thinking that the industry shows signs of improving health,' the analyst said.' There's a calendar effect that only accounts for a fraction of the increase. 'At the recent Air Cargo Forum there was much speculation as to what had caused the improvements.' A sporty game! 
Shipping: 'A majority of Splash readers fear container freight rates will only pick up later than 2020. With 10 days to go until voting closes in our quarterly online survey, called MarPoll, roughly one quarter of the more than 500 respondents to date feel container freight rates will pick up only after 2020' [ Splash 24/7 ]. ''Shipping may have to accept the bubble has burst and what was will not be again. There is a new normal and companies need to plan as such,' one respondent noted' 
Shipping: '[The Boston Consulting Group Inc.] said shipping capacity will outstrip demand by between 8.2% and 13.8% in 2020, compared with a 7% gap today. If borne out, that forecast would indicate this year's plunging freight rates and shrinking profits for marine carriers will only grow worse, particularly on major trade lanes across the Pacific and between Asia and Europe' [ Wall Street Journal , 'More Pain Ahead for Ocean Shipping']. 'The shipping industry hasn't adjusted to a slowdown in global trade, with shipyards churning out giant container vessels and carriers holding onto excess capacity even as rates fall. Historically, container shipping demand grew over 5% annually, often outpacing global economic growth. Between 2015 and 2020, BCG estimates container demand will rise between 2.2% and 3.8% annually.' And we're still building out warehouses… 
Shipping: 'Cummins shipped just 16,400 engines in North America in the quarter, down 33% from a year ago. That's in line with a downturn in orders for big rigs that's triggered layoffs among truck makers and led Cummins to cut its spending on research and engineering more than 14% in the first nine months of the year' [ Wall Street Journal ]. 
Shipping: 'Shipping finally emerging from 2009 downturn, Mitropoulos argues' [ Lloyd's List ]. 'Signs are finally materialising that the industry is emerging from its protracted downturn, according to a former secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization.Efthimios Mitropoulos was speaking on Tuesday morning at the Shipping and the Law Conference in Naples.' Great courage! 
Honey for the Bears: 'Most of the leading indicators are based on factors which are known to have significant backward revisions – and one cannot take any of their trends to the bank. I continue to pose the question: '[W]hat good is a leading indicator where the data is continued to change after it is issued?'' [ Econintersect ]. 'The only indicators with minimal backward revision are ECRI, RecessionALERT, and the Chemical Activity Barometer. Unfortunately, the Chemical Activity Barometer is targeted to the industrial sector of the economy – and at best seems to be a coincident indicator, not a leading indicator. Both ECRI and RecessionALERT were forecasting economic improvement beginning at mid-2016 – and is now forecasting flat (but relatively better) growth beginning 5 months from now. Econintersect sees NO dynamic which will deliver better growth anyone will feel in the foreseeable future. All economic growth will only be seen when one uses a calculator.' 
Infrastructure: 'A pipeline explosion in Alabama is roiling U.S. fuel markets and putting a spotlight on tight domestic shipping capacity. The major Colonial pipeline fuel artery was severed for the second time in two months this week' [ Wall Street Journal ]. 
Fodder for the Bulls: 'Update: The Endless Parade of Recession Calls' [ Calculated Risk ]. 'Looking at the economic data, the odds of a recession in 2016 are very low (extremely unlikely in my view). [a recession in 2017 is very unlikely]. Someday I'll make another recession call, but I'm not even on recession watch now.' 
Fodder for the Bulls: 'Eurozone factories had their most active month for almost three years in October, and raised their prices for the first time in more than a year, according to a survey of purchasing managers released Wednesday' [ Wall Street Journal , 'Eurozone Factory Survey Shows Expansion']. 
Today's Fear & Greed Index: 18 Fear (previous close: 22, Fear) [ CNN ]. One week ago: 43 (Fear). (0 is Extreme Fear; 100 is Extreme Greed). Last updated Nov 2 at 11:26am. Heading for single digits? 
Police State Watch 
'Raided but never charged, cannabis distributor seeks return of seized assets' [ San Diego Tribune (RF)]. ''It's the dirty little secret of the American justice system,' [James] Slatic said in an interview. 'They can come in and take all your money and property just on the say-so of a police officer. Once they do that, you have to go to court and prove why your money is not guilty.'' (Obama made noises about ending asset forfeiture, but resumed it . Of course, asset forfeiture will be a lot easier when digital cash arrives! 
Standing Rock and #NoDAPL 
'I used to think there was no rational argument for civilian possession of military-style weapons. But in light of the disparate treatment of the armed Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupiers (who were acquitted of all charges Friday) and the protesters in North Dakota supporting the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in its fight against construction of an oil pipeline, it's apparent that such weapons are now an effective component of the protester's toolkit' [Letter to the Editor, Los Angeles Times ]. Well, the difference isn't that the Malheur occupiers were white, given that the (sadly but mostly) white Occupy movement was treated to a 17-city coordinated paramilitary crackdown orchestrated by Obama's DHS; the difference is that they were right wing (and white). So the Sioux are both the 'wrong' color, and their cause is percieved by the country at large as on the left (though I think the Sioux themselves would reject that framework). 
'Want to Help the Standing Rock Sioux? Here's Where to Donate' [ Money (!!)]. 'A GoFundMe set up by protester Ho Waste Wakiya Wicasa has raised more than $1 million, which will be used for the camp's operating expenses. 'The money goes as quickly as it comes, but without it having been as much as it is, we certainly wouldn't have been able to be as productive as we have been in the fight,' Wicasa told Fox News. The funds raised have been used for groceries, yurts, toilets, a medical area, a generator, and bail for those arrested.' 
'After 37 Ohio State Highway Patrol troopers left for the Standing Rock protests in North Dakota Saturday, a majority of Cincinnati City Council issued a letter to Gov. John Kasich requesting the troopers be brought home' [ USA Today ]. 'The signers said the trooper should come home so they can focus on Ohio issues, naming the heroin epidemic and increased traffic fatalities.' Tough choice. After all, the troopers could use the practice. 
Black Injustice Tipping Point 
'Net worth of white households in D.C. region is 81 times that of black households' [ WaPo ]. 'The Urban Institute report, called 'The Color of Wealth in the Nation's Capital,' said the Great Recession and housing crisis of 2007 to 2009 exacerbated long-persistent disparities, with black and Hispanic households losing about half of their wealth.' 
Class Warfare 
'Data can help hotel executives manage workforce' [ Hotel News Notes ]. 'Performance evaluations are another area where big data can play an important role. Instead of the usual, subjective assessments by supervisors, employees can be judged through company-tracked data, which may measure:' Punctuality; results of client/manager surveys; tracking of output keyed directly to the percentage of time and input of all contributing workers; and non-health related biometric data or other feedback associated with wearable technology, such as how employees traverse during the workday. 
This creates a more objective review process – reducing bias and the threat of lawsuits – and takes pressure off supervisors. 
That little point on wearables seems a little Orwellian. They won't be able to force me to wear my wearable at all times , right? 
'The east sides of New York, London and Paris are noticeably and famously poorer than their western sides. And it turns out there's a reason for that' [ MarketWatch ]. 'Researchers have found that it's due to the impact of air pollutants at the time of the Industrial Revolution, as prevailing winds in the U.S. and Europe typically blow from west to east. And it's an impact that has lasted into today' ( original study ). 
'Twenty-First Century Victorians' [ Jacobin ]. 'Today's upper middle class maintains the fiction of a meritocratic society, just as the Victorians did. This story allows them to shore up their economic position behind the backs of workers, who are taught that their health problems and dismal career prospects represent individual faults, not systemic dysfunction. Of course, exercising, eating organic food, and pushing children to use their spare time usefully are not inherently bad things. However, they become markers of bourgeois values when they are marshaled to assert one class's moral superiority over another and to justify social inequality. It was just as obnoxious in the nineteenth century as it is today.' 
UPDATE 'Behind 2016's Turmoil, a Crisis of White Identity' [Amanda Taub, New York Times ] 'Whiteness, in this context, is more than just skin color. You could define it as membership in the 'ethno-national majority,' but that's a mouthful. What it really means is the privilege of not being defined as 'other.' Whiteness means being part of the group whose appearance, traditions, religion and even food are the default norm. It's being a person who, by unspoken rules, was long entitled as part of 'us' instead of 'them.'' Peak identity politics? I wonder how many of the academic entrepreneurs pushing this stuff live in leafy suburbs, or nice little college towns… 
'Socially influenced preferences' [ Stumbling and Mumbling ]. Wait, what? Actors aren't atomized, 'rational' individuals? 
News of the Wired 
'How Ancient Humans Reached Remote South Pacific Islands' [ New York Times ]. ''Our paper supports the idea that what people needed was boating technology or navigation technology that would allow them to move efficiently against the wind,' Dr. Montenegro said.'

ARTICLE

by Jerri-Lynn Scofield 
Jerri-Lynn here: This short post by Jack Gao of the Institute for New International Thinking (INET) highlights a pressing problem afflicting the world economy: the slowdown of international trade. As the post summarises, there's no consensus among economists on the causes for that slowdown. 
One major quibble with the post. Gal's passing statement below, 'The desire of those hurt by globalization to shield themselves from foreign competition via protectionist or retaliatory policies is a growing influence in the political life of a number of countries, including the world's most advanced democracies,' seems to fail to grasp the true basis for widespread opposition to pending so-called 'trade agreements'. Opposition movements are not necessarily motivated by opposition to trade per se, but by concerns over transparency, how the gains from these agreements have and will be distributed, and limitations on sovereignty and regulation imposed by procedures such as the Investor-State Dispute Settlement mechanism. And the responses to such concerns under discussion are not what I would describe as traditionally protectionist or retaliatory, but instead combine calls for greater transparency, attention to distributional issues, and a halt– or at minimum, profound rethink– of measures that constrain sovereignty or stymie effective regulation (e.g., threats to the European Union's precautionary principle). To be fair, these issues are peripheral to Gao's major aim in the piece, which is to account for the slowdown in international trade. 
I should also remind readers who're only familiar with Paul Krugman through his New York Times column that his initial academic work concerned international trade. 
By Jack Gao, who is a Program Economist at the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET), with interests in international economics and finance, energy policy, economic development, and the Chinese economy. He previously worked in financial product and data departments in Bloomberg Singapore, and reported on Asian financial markets in Bloomberg News from Shanghai. Jack holds a MPA in International Development from Harvard Kennedy School, and a B.S. in Economics from Singapore Management University. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking Website . 
Challenged by mathematician Stanislaw Ulam to name one idea in economics that was both true and non-trivial, Nobel economics laureate Paul Samuelson famously nominated comparative advantage — the notion that even a country less productive in producing everything, could still benefit from international trade by specializing in the commodity it faces the least disadvantages in producing. But comparative advantage fails to explain why international trade, which has underpinned the global economy for much its modern history, is showing signs of a slowdown. 
Originally attributed to the English classical economist David Ricardo and later formalized by generations of economists including Samuelson, trade theories rooted in comparative advantage hold that free trade should raise the overall welfare of all nations that engage in it. Wages of Chinese workers should rise, as would income levels of American capital owners, if the two countries open up to trade. And any negative impact domestically could be ameliorated by making the necessary transfers to compensate those hurt by trade. The remarkable rise in the living standards of citizens in Japan, the four 'Asian Tiger' economies, and most notably China, are testaments to free trade working its magic. 
However, many find the marked slowdown in global trade since the 2008 financial crisis as puzzling as the tepid GDP growth that has accompanied the recovery. 
First, some facts. In the heyday of its economic expansion, China's current account surplus stood at more than 10% of its GDP; that figure was a mere 2% for the first half of this year. The IMF has documented a 3% annual expansion of global trade since 2012, less than half of its annual growth rate in the previous three decade. This trend holds within developed countries, as well as between developed and developing countries. 
Experts are debating the underlying causes of the trade slowdown. The most obvious explanation may be to point to the disruption caused by the 2008 financial crisis, and the prolonged weakness in subsequent economic activities. With the collapse of the western financial system, world economic growth dipped into negative territory for the first time in recent history — from its pre-crisis level of around 4% — and global trade decline ensued. Since then, however, trade, which has historically grown at twice the rate of GDP growth, has grown more or less in tandem with the sluggish output recovery. Clearly, something else is causing the breakdown. 
Another explanation frequently offered has been the restructuring in China. The world's second largest economy, which in recent decades powered the world's economic activities, had been an even more important driver of growth in world trade. But after 2008, Beijing put more emphasis on domestic economic concerns instead of promoting foreign trade. This rebalancing, however, represents a response to the fall in external demand rather than a deliberate strategy to turn away from trade, and thus is unlikely to be causing the global trade decline. 
The WTO warned that these trends could damage an already weak world economy. The desire of those hurt by globalization to shield themselves from foreign competition via protectionist or retaliatory policies is a growing influence in the political life of a number of countries, including the world's most advanced democracies. But while they may pose serious threats to the future of globalization, protectionist policies have not been implemented on a time frame that could have caused the trade slowdown. Nor is the decline in trade restricted to commerce between countries where populist influence is strongest. 
Economist Paul Krugman sees the answer lying in the relative speed of technological progress in transportation and the rest of the economy. Real transport costs could rise, according to Krugman, if the technological advances in transportation are slower than the economy-wide technological changes. Economists in the IMF believe believe changes in the pace of international vertical specialization, the decision to use domestic versus imported inputs, are causing the lackluster expansion of trade. All of these explanations, however, seem unlikely in the context of a world of such great differences in cost and technology — precisely the conditions under which, through the logic of comparative advantage, free trade promised such universal benefits. 
If the causes of a slowdown in global trade remain a matter of ongoing debate, its impact and implications for the global economy are unmistakably real and increasingly urgent. 0 0 0 0 0 0

by Outis Philalithopoulos By Outis Philalithopoulos, who met an untimely end five years ago, and now 'wears the chains he forged in life' as an economist. Previous events in this series led the ghost of Outis back to 1996. After meeting the first of three Spirits and being shown a series of sometimes unwelcome visions, Outis found himself alone. I thought about the people I had seen during my spectral journey. They seemed to think of themselves as liberals, even though they would be out of place among modern progressives. I toyed with an evolutionary explanation. There were things Brown didn't understand about forceful communication, and things Franken didn't understand about a lot of subjects, but maybe the two of them were 'primitive progressives,' who hadn't yet developed into real progressives. Maybe if someone had just called them out, they would have understood, and grown. One thing Franken and Brown had in common is that they both came off as smarter than the people they criticized. To me, being progressive was basically about not being stupid, and so it was unsurprising that primitive progressives had also tried to show that they were intelligent. But to reach that end, Franken and Brown used different strategies. Franken seemed one of a group of 90s Democrats who saw themselves as having mastered the most defensible positions on each issue. Support of deficit reduction and trade pacts were orthodox positions of mainstream economics, and so for these liberals, there wasn't any political problem here – you just needed to say the correct answer as quickly as possible. For Brown, on the other hand, her self-confidence was tied more closely to her academic career, and to her ability to see around and behind 'narratives' that other people might believe in. What else brought the 'whipsmart' Democrats and the academic postmodernists together? Not much, as far as I could tell, except that they both disliked sounding too definite. In other words, they also had in common a sort of 'postmodern attitude.' I wondered if my generalizations about primitive progressives held more broadly. What else could I remember about liberals of the time? There was a lot said about self-esteem. One time in high school something bad happened and a teacher wanted us to hold hands, and talk and feel together – or was that a movie? Regardless, many people did seemed to prize being non-judgmental. Wendy Brown had worried about whether some liberals genuinely believed in postmodernism, especially those trying to represent particular demographic groups. Even those writers, according to Brown, typically claimed to believe that culture was socially constructed, but they also wanted to privilege the perspectives of people who had suffered more, and treat their suffering as objectively real. Brown didn't explain why this was supposed to be a problem, and clearly later progressives had realized that Brown was wrong to be so concerned. If primitive progressives had been a 'rainbow coalition' of disparate groups who didn't have much in common besides smartness and a vague commitment to postmodernism, how were they able to work together at all? How had we managed to banish the specter of postmodernism, and build an unprecedented degree of cultural cohesion and confidence? A finger touched my shoulder. Michel had returned. 'I know you are weary of my presence,' he began sympathetically, 'and so I will speed you to the last clues I can provide.' 'But can we instead…' I began. Before I could finish my sentence, the horizon blurred and I found ourselves in a large lecture hall, surrounded by people who seemed very important, and somber. At the podium was a stern man in suit and tie. His voice rang through the hall: Something else died on Tuesday, in addition to thousands of innocent people. It was the doctrine of moral equivalency — the idea that people everywhere are just like us, or can be made so by meeting their demands. These humanistic, 'can't we all get along,' 'profiling potential terrorists is racism,' 'we're all God's children,' Kumbaya, 'all we're saying is give peace a chance' moral equivalency equivocators will soon be back. They'll try to wear down our resolve. They should be ignored. Evil exists. It must be opposed. If this is war, let's start acting like it and tell America's enemies that if they are so intent on seeing their God, we'll help them get there. As for us, we intend to die of natural causes. The audience cheered. 'I guess this is 9/11?' I said to Foucault. 'Two days later,' he concurred. 'And this guy is some sort of rightwinger?' He nodded. 'Syndicated columnist Cal Thomas.' A young, smartly dressed woman was speaking to her neighbor. 'Guess what's on the bestseller list right now?' Her somewhat older neighbor shook her head. ' Quarterlife Crisis – a book written by two twentysomethings bemoaning the,' and here her voice became brutally sarcastic, ' landmine period in our adult development during the transition from college graduation into the real world.'' 'The poor dears,' said the neighbor. 'Many of them feel,' and here her voice took the same tone as it had before, ' helpless, panicked, indecisive, and apprehensive . You know what this generation needs? A real crisis. And now…. we have one. Our generational wake-up call. Our bloody moment of shattered self-complacency.' 'Michel, Michel,' I said, annoyed. 'I get it. The Right was fixated on the idea that progressives lacked moral clarity. Whatever truth there was in that claim, it's clearly false now. What I'd really like to know is…' But Foucault shook his head and put a finger to his lips. Again, the scene shifted. We were in another room, with another speaker and another audience. This venue, though, was rather small, and while some attendants looked rather professional, others were dressed informally. Foucault whispered to me, '2007.' The audience listened intently to the speaker. She exuded an infectious, intimate candor as she talked about Internet activism. You know what? Sometimes we're very, very rude. I go right into the face of mainstream media writers' faces and call them out. I'm right in there with the worst of them, foul-mouthed, vituperative, and personal. There's a reason for that: it's the only way to get their attention ! We have a beef – and I maintain it's legitimate and important. For years we've watched the mainstream media aid and abet the right wing to the point at which they behaved like a bunch of puerile cheerleaders for an absurd impeachment and stolen election. Iraq was the frosting on the cake. There's no amount of polite discourse that's going to shake up that comfortable relationship. And after Iraq, it's become downright dangerous. Finally, a real progressive, I thought to myself. As she ended her speech, two men in expensive suits, with open collars, faced each other. 'She's right, you know, and it's not just the media,' one remarked. 'No shit,' the other seconded. 'Say what you want about the Republicans, they know how to win. All we know how to do is lose.' The first shook his head in disgust. 'The whole Democratic Party has become a bunch of,' and he lowered his voice, 'pussies.' I looked angrily at Foucault. He put a sympathetic hand on my shoulder. The second man also shook his head. 'We need to grow some balls.' He paused, then went on. 'The thing is, I know this sounds optimistic after the last couple decades, but I actually think some people are starting to get it.' 'It's true,' the first acknowledged. 'Take Rahm Emanuel. Someone tries to swift boat him, he swift boats them back. Some people don't like him 'cause he's abrasive and says fuck a lot, but if you ask me, we need more people where you kinda feel like, this guy isn't intimidated by Karl Rove.' 'Yeah, Rahm's cool,' the second said. 'We just need to put ourselves out there more. Stop letting the Republicans paint us as weak. Stop accepting that they're just going to get all the good donors.' 'Exactly,' the first said with some passion. 'And it's not like this means compromising our principles.' 'Of course not,' snorted the second. 'I mean, we have our convictions. We just need to be smarter.' 'Michel,' I said with some heat. 'if the point is supposed to be that in our efforts to stand up to the right wing, we became more like them, I have to say, I find the idea unpersuasive and offensive.' 'Well…,' he began. I motioned him to silence. 'I think it's really not that complicated. With the rise of the Internet, it became easier for good ideas to circulate and harder for bad ideas to escape criticism. So of course we were able to stick up for the truth more vigorously, and be less wishy-washy than before. Sort of like how the printing press made the Reformation possible…' 'I see!' he exclaimed, brightening. 'You cast yourself as one of the early Protestants, upholding a more rigorous standard of morality against the worldly and corrupt Catholics who preceded you. The Internet punishes tentativeness, just as the printing press made it so Erasmus' skepticism could be pilloried by Luther in their debate on free will.' 'Uh…' I said, a little disoriented by his tendency to show off his erudition. 'But perhaps,' he mused, 'if the earlier liberals are the medieval Catholic church, then you are the Counter-Reformation, strengthening the discipline of the Catholic faithful by imposing meticulous rules of self-examination and intensifying the obligation of confession?' That sounded less flattering. Michel frowned and took a step back. Some sort of invisible force was tugging on the back of his shirt. He turned to me and sighed. ' Désolé, but my time has grown very short.' I opened my mouth to say something, but Foucault, and the room from 2007, disappeared. In their place stood a bunny, looking me straight in the eye. * * * In the next episode, Outis journeys into a popular and widely praised artistic representation of modern liberal culture.

by Jerri-Lynn Scofield 
Jerri-Lynn here: I first became aware of the consequences of Hanjin's collapse via Lambert's coverage in Water Cooler. The South Korean government's bailout strategy– a version of kick the can down the road– looks worrying and unsustainable, given the ongoing slowdown in world trade , with little cause for optimism that trend will reverse anytime soon. As Richter indicates, much more pain is sure to follow. 
By Wolf Richter, a San Francisco based executive, entrepreneur, start up specialist, and author, with extensive international work experience. Originally published at Wolf Street, 
The ravaged shipbuilding industry in South Korea, deemed too big to fail, is getting its largest taxpayer bailout yet, totaling $9.6 billion, on top of the bailout funds already handed out last year, and on top of another $9.6 billion this year to bail out state-owned banks that were getting slammed by defaulting loans extended to the shipping industry. 
Their problem: according to trade ministry, cited by the Wall Street Journal , orders for new ships to be built in South Korea have collapsed by 87% over the past nine months from the already terrible 9-month period last year, to almost nothing. 
South Korean container carrier Hanjin was allowed to collapse in August. It 'shattered the complacency' that TBTF carriers 'are immune to failure.' It is now getting chopped into pieces to be sold off under bankruptcy court orders. Its rival, Hyundai Merchant Marine, was bailed out and restructured earlier this year. Other carriers around the globe have been sunk by two years of excruciating low shipping rates, triggered by rampant overcapacity and stagnating world trade. Larger carriers are consolidating to survive. Just on Monday, Japan's Big Three – Nippon Yusen, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha – announced that they would merge to form the world's sixth largest container carrier. 
These carriers have stopped ordering ships, and many have canceled orders, and Chinese shipbuilders have muscled into the market years ago to grab share by slashing prices, and they too are going bankrupt . 
But the shipbuilding industry is special to South Korea, a country whose economy depends on exports. The world's three largest shipbuilders by erstwhile order volume are Korean: Hyundai Heavy Industries, Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, and Samsung Heavy Industries. In 2015, the industry accounted for 7.1% of South Korea's manufacturing jobs and 7.6% of exports. 
The beleaguered Big Three have already sold noncore assets and sloughed off employees as part of prior bank-led restructuring plans. 
They're dealing with terrible economic dynamics. Global orders for ships peaked in 2007 at over 90 million compensated gross tonnage (CGT), of which about one-third went to Korean shipbuilders. Orders crashed during the Financial Crisis to a low of 18 million CGT in 2009, then recovered. In 2013, orders maxed out at 60 million CGT, still down 33% from the prior peak. Those were the good times. 
In 2016 so far, orders have collapsed to only 9 million CGT, according to the Wall Street Journal. That's about half of the orders during the worst part of the Financial Crisis. And South Korea's share of this pittance in orders has fallen from one-third to just a tiny sliver. 
So on Monday, South Korean Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho announced another big bailout program: to help the shipbuilding industry deal with the 'order cliff,' the government would directly order vessels and also provide financing for shipping companies to order vessels. In total, this would generate orders for 250 vessels through 2020, valued at 11 trillion won ($9.6 billion) funded by the government. 
But these ships won't be the big traditional money makers, such as large containerships and dry-bulk carriers, of which the world is already vastly oversupplied. Instead, these will be vessels for the fishing industry and for small shipping companies, along with ferries, patrol boats, warships, and coastguard vessels. The hope is this will carry shipyards into the next glory period, when world trade and shipbuilding would resurge. 
For now, the government is hoping to keep the Big Three shipbuilders alive. They will have to shed 32% of their workforce by 2018, cut their operations by 23%, sell more noncore businesses, and take other measures. 
This bailout comes on top of prior bailouts, including the one of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering in October 2015, when the state-owned Export-Import Bank of Korea and the Korea Development Bank (which already owned a controlling 31.5% stake) handed it a $3.7 billion bailout package of new loans, a rights offering, and debt-to-equity swaps. 
The South Korean shipbuilders weren't just sunk by the collapse of the global shipping industry, but also by their expedition into new territories: Seeing over the years that orders for big vessels would be heading south, and that prices were under pressure from competition in China, they decided in 2010 to get into the nirvana of profits: building offshore oil rigs. But that turned into a nightmare, and heavy losses, even before the price of oil crashed. 
In June, the government and the Bank of Korea set up a special fund of 11 trillion won ($9.6 billion) to recapitalize state-run banks which were getting hit by defaulting loans from carriers and shipbuilders. 
In addition, the finance ministry said the government would offer 6.5 trillion won ($5.6 billion) for South Korean carriers to order new bigger vessels to improve their profit margins and survive a little longer. And then there are plans to create a state-backed ship-financing company with initial capital of 1 trillion won ($880 million). 
No one knows for sure how long the misery in the shipbuilding and shipping industries will continue. Overcapacity is a terrible condition. Creating it benefits many on the way up. It enriches them and makes the economy look good. But when it comes home to roost, the price is stiff. People lose their jobs. And many of the costs will be socialized. It's only then that you see just how much capital has already gone down the drain, and how much more will follow. 
The pain will continue, with many more false-hope-ups and brutal smack-downs, and more carriers will crack under their debt. Read… Why Hanjin's Zombie Collapse Won't Be the Last One . 0 0 0 0 0 0 This entry was posted in Guest Post on

Hostility toward women is one of the strongest predictors of Trump support Vox (ChiGal) 
Seems rather obvious – so would 'Hostility toward men is one of the strongest predictors of Hillary support'. Neither sentence makes a conclusion about what percentage of bigots in either group. 
One other thing I find odd is the chart for Romney vs. Trump. Unless I've missed something about Obama being a woman cross-dressing, then Romney wasn't running against a woman, so anyone having said bias as their primary motivator for decision making would have had to look further down their decision logic tree to secondary motivators to decide which ballot lever to pull. There is very little interest in rigor in political science or social science.

By Jerri-Lynn Scofield, who has worked as a securities lawyer and a derivatives trader. She now spends most of her time in India and other parts of Asia researching a book about textile artisans. She also writes regularly about legal, political economy, and regulatory topics for various consulting clients and publications, as well as writes occasional travel pieces for The National . 
Just in time to pander for progressive votes in the home stretch leading into the election, the Obamamometer suggested earlier this week that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers may be open to rerouting the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), currently the subject of protests organized in support of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other pipeline opponents. 
The DAPL is designed to transport light sweet crude oil from the Bakken Shield in North Dakota — an area not served by existing pipelines — through South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois. DAPL would supersede the previous distribution arrangements, under which oil from this source was shipped by train. 
What's now occurring follows the playbook I suggested would be used in my September post, Dakota Pipeline Will Proceed As Feds Undertake Smoke and Mirrors Policy Reconsideration . And the administration is still promising to pay us on Tuesday. 
Soft, Sibilant, Sweet Nothings 
As reported DeSmogBlog's Steven Horn, in As President Obama Hints At Dakota Access Possible Reroute, Tensions Swirl at Standing Rock — which is worth a read for the additional details and context it provides, the Obamamometer said the Corps would consider rerouting following a continued consultation process. His key weasel words: 
right now the Army Corps is examining whether there are ways we can reroute this pipeline, so we're going to let it play out for several more weeks and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that is properly attentive to the tradition of First Americans. 
To be fair, he did genuflect in the direction of the First Amendment and call for both authorities and protestors to show restraint (as reported by the BBC ): 
There is an obligation for protesters to be peaceful, and there's an obligation for authorities to show restraint… I want to make sure that as everybody is exercising their constitutional rights to be heard, that both sides are refraining from situations that might result in people being hurt. 
Standing Rock Sioux Ask for DOJ Investigation 
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has asked the Department of Justice to intervene and investigate alleged civil rights abuses in pipeline policing, which has been conducted by state and local police and private security companies. North Dakota earlier this month approved an additional $4 million for policing the DAPL protest, raising total expenditures to 10 million .

The Wall Street Journal also posted video footage filmed yesterday. 
Faith in Vague Promises 
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe issued a press release in which they chose to take the Obamamometer at his word: 
We applaud President Obama's commitment to protect our sacred lands, our water, and the water of 17 million others. 
While the Army Corps of Engineers is examining this issue we call on the administration and the Corps to issue an immediate 'stop work order' on the Dakota Access Pipeline. And given the flawed process that has put our drinking water in jeopardy, we also urge the Administration to call for a full environmental impact study. 
The nation and the world are watching. The injustices done to Native people in North Dakota and throughout the country must be addressed. 
We believe President Obama and his Administration will do the right thing. 
Yet as Horn reported, Greenpeace is made of stronger stuff: 
The administration seems to be buying time to maintain the status quo and profits for fossil fuel investors,' Greenpeace USA spokeswoman Lilian Molina said in a press release. 'There is only one option that is truly attentive to the Native lives and lands at stake: respect the rights and sovereignty of Indigenous communities by revoking the permits immediately.' 
Greenpeace USA, meanwhile, called for Obama to reverse the Army Corps permit granted for the pipeline. It opined that Obama was engaging in a stalling tactic. 
'The administration seems to be buying time to maintain the status quo and profits for fossil fuel investors,' Greenpeace USA spokeswoman Lilian Molina said in a press release. 'There is only one option that is truly attentive to the Native lives and lands at stake: respect the rights and sovereignty of Indigenous communities by revoking the permits immediately.' 
Will Wider Audience Be Gulled? 
The intended audience for the Obamamometer's remarks is much wider than those immediately involved in the protests. The BBC report notes, 'The protest has gathered widespread attention and social media support, prompting 1.4 million people to 'check in' to the location on Facebook in solidarity. The Democrats are clearly trying to maximize turnout among younger progressives, many of whom have shown little inclination to support Hillary Clinton's candidacy. 
Despite the need to attract these votes, Clinton hewed to her game plan of offering few positive reasons to support her candidacy and missed the chance to make this issue one on which she'd stake out a progressive position. Instead, as Horn noted, she 'offered a wishy-washy statement on the project, using many words to say very little', and which said in part: 
From the beginning of this campaign, Secretary Clinton has been clear that she thinks all voices should be heard and all views considered in federal infrastructure projects… 
Now, all of the parties involved—including the federal government, the pipeline company and contractors, the state of North Dakota, and the tribes—need to find a path forward that serves the broadest public interest. As that happens, it's important that on the ground in North Dakota, everyone respects demonstrators' rights to protest peacefully, and workers' rights to do their jobs safely. 
Ongoing Formal, Government-To-Government Consultations 
As I wrote in September, 
The Department of Justice, the Department of the Army, and the Department of the Interior waded into the controversy over construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline (DAPL) [yesterday], shortly after U.S. federal court judge James E. Boasberg denied a request for a preliminary injunction to halt its construction in his Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ruling. 
The three agencies recognized: 
…[T}his case has highlighted the need for a serious discussion on whether there should be nationwide reform with respect to considering tribes' views on these types of infrastructure projects. Therefore, this fall, we will invite tribes to formal, government-to-government consultations on two questions: (1) within the existing statutory framework, what should the federal government do to better ensure meaningful tribal input into infrastructure-related reviews and decisions and the protection of tribal lands, resources, and treaty rights; and (2) should new legislation be proposed to Congress to alter that statutory framework and promote those goals. 
The three agencies continue to conduct these consultations on federal infrastructure decisions, with a key meeting scheduled for November 17 in Rapid City, South Dakota and the final session due to be completed via teleconference on November 21. Conveniently, these discussions will conclude after election day. 
Pipeline Proponents Didn't Get the Memo 
Unsurprisingly, pipeline proponents opposed even the weak commitment seemingly made in the interview. Some of the parties to the pipeline have entered into long-term binding contracts with shippers in anticipation of the DAPL and its related facilities coming on stream later this year. Despite the announcement in the three agency statement that the Corps of Engineers would not authorize constructing DAPL on Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe until it conducted a further policy review– and asking that'the pipeline company voluntarily pause all construction activity within 20 miles east or west of Lake Oahu', construction on the rest of the pipeline has proceeded, so that now it is estimated that the DAPL is now more than three-quarters completed. 
The Wall Street Journal quoted a spokeswoman for Energy Transfer Partners LP, which is constructing DAPL, as saying: 
the company isn't aware of any consideration being given to rerouting the project. She said the company also expects to receive the final federal approval for a disputed portion of the pipeline in a timely fashion. 
In an internal company memo on Sept. 13, Energy Transfer CEO Kelcy Warren said the pipeline was nearly 60% complete and that the company had spent more than $1.6 billion on the project. 
Likely Outcome? 
Despite the hopes and dreams of progressives, the administration will face heavy pressure to conclude its review process in time for those involved in the project to honour existing supply contracts. Alternatively issue may be dumped onto the incoming administration. The WSJ reported that neither the Trump nor Clinton campaign has taken a position on DAPL construction. 
Despite the Obamamometer's remarks, I'd be very surprised indeed if the Corps were to present a viable plan to reroute the pipeline at this late date. And if it does, further lawsuits would inevitably follow. 0 0 0 0 0 1

The first shook his head in disgust. 'The whole Democratic Party has become a bunch of,' and he lowered his voice, 'pussies.' I looked angrily at Foucault. He put a sympathetic hand on my shoulder. The second man also shook his head. 'We need to grow some balls.' He paused, then went on. 'The thing is, I know this sounds optimistic after the last couple decades, but I actually think some people are starting to get it.' 'It's true,' the first acknowledged. 'Take Rahm Emanuel. Someone tries to swift boat him, he swift boats them back. Some people don't like him 'cause he's abrasive and says fuck a lot, but if you ask me, we need more people where you kinda feel like, this guy isn't intimidated by Karl Rove.' 'Yeah, Rahm's cool,' the second said. 'We just need to put ourselves out there more. Stop letting the Republicans paint us as weak. Stop accepting that they're just going to get all the good donors.' 'Exactly,' the first said with some passion. 'And it's not like this means compromising our principles.' 'Of course not,' snorted the second. 'I mean, we have our convictions. We just need to be smarter.' 'Michel,' I said with some heat. 'if the point is supposed to be that in our efforts to stand up to the right wing, we became more like them, I have to say, I find the idea unpersuasive and offensive.' 'Well…,' he began. I motioned him to silence. 'I think it's really not that complicated. With the rise of the Internet, it became easier for good ideas to circulate and harder for bad ideas to escape criticism. So of course we were able to stick up for the truth more vigorously, and be less wishy-washy than before. Sort of like how the printing press made the Reformation possible…' 'I see!' he exclaimed, brightening. 'You cast yourself as one of the early Protestants, upholding a more rigorous standard of morality against the worldly and corrupt Catholics who preceded you. The Internet punishes tentativeness, just as the printing press made it so Erasmus' skepticism could be pilloried by Luther in their debate on free will.' 'Uh…' I said, a little disoriented by his tendency to show off his erudition. 'But perhaps,' he mused, 'if the earlier liberals are the medieval Catholic church, then you are the Counter-Reformation, strengthening the discipline of the Catholic faithful by imposing meticulous rules of self-examination and intensifying the obligation of confession?' That sounded less flattering. Michel frowned and took a step back. Some sort of invisible force was tugging on the back of his shirt. He turned to me and sighed. ' Désolé, but my time has grown very short.' I opened my mouth to say something, but Foucault, and the room from 2007, disappeared. In their place stood a bunny, looking me straight in the eye. * * * In the next episode, Outis journeys into a popular and widely praised artistic representation of modern liberal culture.

Days until: 4. Now you can count the days on the fingers of one hand! 
Corruption 
'Hillary Clinton Economic Team Planned Secret Meeting With Wall Street Mogul Pushing To Shift Retiree Savings To Financial Firms' [David Sirota, International Business Times ]. And Sirota is a busy lad– 
'How Donald Trump Used Fine Print To Make It Harder To Sue Wall Street For Fraud' [David Sirota, International Business Times ]. In Links this morning, but amplifying: 
According to hundreds of pages of court documents reviewed by International Business Times, Trump notched a victory for himself and the financial industry by convincing judges that his own fine print warnings meant he had not deceived investors when he lured them to bet — and ultimately lose — hundreds of millions of dollars on one of his riskiest development projects. The real estate mogul known for his litigiousness helped Corporate America secure a ruling making it harder for investors to file lawsuits. Unlike his other past business moves that appeared to affect only Trump's business partners, vendors and customers, this Trump case helped set a court precedent that was soon codified into law. 
Trump, in essence, argued 'it's my nature': 
Trump did not explicitly challenge the plaintiffs' allegations that his prospectus contained misleading or inaccurate information. Instead, his lawyer argued that 'the cautionary language in this prospectus was so complete, so repetitive, so obvious and so well designed' that it could not have misled investors. The court concurred. 
'Let's set aside Hillary Clinton as an individual and consider her as the perfection of a corrupt political system. As I noted yesterday, Politics As Usual Is Dead, and Hillary Clinton is the ultimate product of the political system that is disintegrating before our eyes' [ Of Two Minds ]. 'All the Clintons did is assemble the parts more effectively than anyone else. Now that the machine has scooped up hundreds of millions of dollars in 'contributions' and other loot, vested interests and corrupted loyalists within the federal government will do anything to protect the machine and its vast flow of funds.' Which is why Clinton's public promises on policy are meaningless; we don't know who her silent partners are. And that ties rather neatly into her incrementalism, which she frames as 'I don't want to promise what I can't deliver' (but to whom were the promises really made?) More: 'Cobble together a multi-million dollar private foundation, millions of dollars in speaking fees from big-money contributors, conflicts of interest, the secrecy of private email servers, pay-to-play schemes and corrupted loyalists planted in the Department of Justice, and the inevitable result is a politics as usual money-harvesting machine that lays waste to the nation, supporters and critics alike.' 
The Voters 
'The Daily 202: College-educated white women are Hillary Clinton's firewall' [ WaPo ]. 'If the Republican nominee was anywhere close to Romney's 52 percent support level among this traditionally Republican-leaning constituency, he would likely win the election.' From what I read on the Twitter — admittedly an idiosyncratic sample — Clinton's previous firewall feels like she used and abandoned them. So… 
'The End of Black-Checking for Hillary' [ Progressive Army ]. 'Michelle Alexander [author of The New Jim Crow went on MSNBC with Chris Hayes to discuss her concerns about the Clintons. She spoke her truth, our truth. Many in America turned on her. They lined up to tell her she was wrong about the very same things we applauded just a year ago.' Predictably, the Democrat nomenklatura went nuts. One Kossack: And now Michelle Alexander comes to lecture other black folks abt voting for Hillary. Ugh what an awful show from Hayes tonight. Just awful. 
&mdash; Armando (@armandodkos) April 2, 2016 
(I think 'black folks' is a particularly nice touch.) The writer concludes: 'Throwing Michelle Alexander to the wolves to defend the Clintons, of all couples, was far too much for me.' 
'Black voters sue North Carolina over last-minute purges' [ Bloomberg ]. In a last-minute lawsuit. As I keep saying, if the Democrats saw voter registration as a core party function, we wouldn't be seeing shenanigains like this in the first place. 
'Identity and the Election: How Groups of Voters Have Changed Their Minds' [ Bloomberg ]. Here is a breakdown of Clinton's margin before and after the Comey bombshell: 
Clinton support among white college voters increased the most . I suppose they actually bought the idea that Comey, like Trump, is a Russian agent of influence? Who are the 'stupid' voters now, pray tell? 
Policy 
'Memo to the Next President: Avoid the 'Vision Thing' in the Mideast' [ Foreign Policy ]. Internal disagreements in The Blob! And 'old-fashioned GOP realism' looks pretty good compared to crazypants neo-con adventurism (or Clinton's debacle in Libya). 
'Marijuana ballot initiatives 2016: Five more states may make pot legal' [ Yahoo News ]. 'The vote to watch is in California, where polls suggest the 'Adult Use of Marijuana' referendum has a substantial lead.' I just hope marijuana doesn't go corporate… 
'Younger voters overwhelmingly favor marijuana measure, which is likely to pass, poll finds' [ Los Angeles Times ]. 
Downballot 
'Democrats have a good chance to take control of the Senate just two years after losing it. A friendly map with seven Republican-held seats in states President Obama won has opened the door, and now Republicans are hoping Donald Trump doesn't drag them down in the many tough states they have to defend' [ WaPo ]. Thing is, if you look at the chart, '50' is smack dab in middle of 'toss-up.' RCP agrees , with 46 Democrats, 46 Republicans, and 8 toss-ups. These are RCP's toss-ups: PA: Toomey (R), IN: Open (R), WI: Johnson (R), NV: Open (D), MO: Blunt (R), NH: Ayotte (R), FL: Rubio (R), NC: Burr (R). Note that WI, NH, FL, and NC are swing states, too! 
The Trail 
''We've got to be nice and cool, nice and calm. All right, stay on point Donald, stay on point,' Trump said in Pensacola, Fla' [ CNN ]. ''No sidetracks, Donald. Nice and easy,' Trump said.' So Conway is doing her job. 
'Put another way, as Clinton has focused her time and money primarily on swing and Republican-leaning states, the question looming over her campaign is whether she has left herself open to a flanking maneuver from Trump in any of the seemingly safe Democratic states that he is now targeting—key among them Colorado, Michigan, and Wisconsin' [Ron Brownstein, The Atlantic ]. 'Clinton and her allies are responding with a new wave of advertising and more surrogate appearances in those blue-leaning states, and most dramatically, a visit by Clinton herself to Detroit on Friday. But overall they see Trump's late push into these Democratic-leaning places as a sign of weakness, not strength—an admission that at this late date he needs new options for reaching an Electoral College majority because he cannot feel secure of capturing enough of the states both sides consider true battlegrounds.' 
'A tightening race nationally has also translated into tightening at the state level. States that were trending Trump's way in September started to slip away from him in early October. Now, with the focus more on Clinton's emails than on Trump's debate performances or his Twitter spats, states like Iowa and Ohio are moving back in Trump's direction' [ Cook Political Report ]. Republicans 'coming home.' 
'Two things to look for in the exits: First, how is Mr. Trump doing among white voters? His strategy requires grabbing a higher percentage of whites than Mitt Romney's 59% and boosting their share of the turnout above 2012's 72%. College-educated whites traditionally vote Republican, but Mr. Trump has struggled with them. Will he match Mr. Romney's 51% among all college grads?' [Karl Rove, Wall Street Journal , 'What to Watch for on Election Night']. 'Second, how is Mrs. Clinton doing among minorities and millennials? Her strategy calls for replicating President Obama's 2012 coalition. That year African-Americans were 13% of turnout, and 93% went for Mr. Obama; Hispanics were 10% of turnout, and 71% voted for him; and millennials were 19% of turnout, 60% of whom supported the president.' 
'Only voters in six states: Connecticut, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are allowed to void their early or absentee ballots and cast a new vote' [ Daily Dot ]. 
Democrat Email Hairball 
'Here's the updated list of all Podesta docs published by @WikiLeaks that have been proven, or claimed, to be fake' [ Glenn Greenwald ]. 
Stats Watch 
Big stats day today! Incidentally, I quote Econoday first, but — and this is one Maine bear's purely subjective opinion — the tone of the Econoday blurbs is noticeably happier than other commentary. I wouldn't go so far as to say 'happy talk,' but… 
Productivity and Costs, Q3 2016: 'Productivity has burst out of its slump, rising at a better-than-expected annualized pace of 3.1 percent in the third quarter' [ Econoday ]. 'The third-quarter breakdown shows a surge in output, more than doubling to a 3.4 percent growth rate at the same time that growth in hours worked slowed sharply, to a 0.3 percent rate vs the second-quarter's 1.7 percent. Greater efficiency between output and hours worked holds down labor costs which rose only 0.3 percent which is much better than expectations.' And: 'The driving force for third-quarter productivity was a surge in output coupled by the lower labor cost gain' [ 247 Wall Street ]. But: 'Although many times the data is significantly revised between releases – it did not happen in this release. But IF I believed this data, costs are rising significantly whilst productivity is in the toilet (as I only look at year-over-year data – the headline compounding distorts the view)' [ Econintersect ]. 'If data is analyzed in year-over-year fashion, non-farm business productivity was unchanged year-over-year, and unit labor costs were up 2.3 % year-over-year. Bottom line: the year-over-year data is saying that costs are rising faster than productivity.' And but: '[T]he broader trend remains consistent with a decade-long decline' [ Wall Street Journal , 'U.S. Productivity Jumps in Third Quarter, Trend Remains Soft']. 
Jobless Claims, week of October 29, 2016: '[H]olding at or near record lows' [ Econoday ]. '[S]trength in the labor market and suggest that employers are holding tightly onto their employees.' Or jobless claims are hard to file and/or people are terrified of leaving. But: 'The trend of the 4 week moving average is continuing to marginally worsened – and catch up to the rolling averages of a year ago – and this trend historically indicates a weakening GDP' [ Econintersect ]. 
Challenger Job-Cut Report, October 2016: 'Challenger's October layoff count is low,' and lower than the third quarter average [ Econoday ]. '[A] positive signal for tomorrow's employment report.' 
Factory Orders, September 2016: 'Good news is hard to find in the September factory orders report which is best described as flat' [ Econoday ]. And: '[T]he data in this series is noisy so I would rely on the unadjusted 3 month rolling averages which say there was a moderate improvement this month – but this series remains in contraction year-over-year' [ Econintersect ]. 
Gallup Good Jobs Rate, October 2016: Up, in a typical seasonal pattern, and 'higher than any GGJ rate recorded for the month of October since Gallup began tracking this measure in 2010' [ Econoday ]. 'The percentage of U.S. adults who participated in the workforce in October in any capacity — by working full time, working part time or not working but actively seeking and being available for work — was 68.4 percent, up almost a full percentage point from 67.5 percent in September.' 
ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, October 2016: 'Much of the ISM non-manufacturing report, at a composite of 54.8, is strong with employment, however, an exception,' [ Econoday ]. 'Employment growth may be down, but this report, like the services PMI earlier this morning, is pointing to a solid fourth-quarter start for the bulk of the economy.' But: ' This was below the consensus forecast of 56.1, and suggests slower expansion in October than in September' [ Calculated Risk ]. And but: 'New orders were solid at 57.7 in October, but while they were above the net reading they were still down from September's 60.6 reading' [ 247 Wall Street ]. 'Business activity was the same reading at a strong 57.7. But like the new orders component, the net business activity was slower growth than what was seen in September.' 
Purchasing Managers' Index Service Index, October 2016 (final): 'Growth in the nation's service sector accelerated sharply in October based on Markit Economics' U.S. sample' [ Econoday ]. 'Strength in consumer spending is what respondents reported as well as a rise in both input costs and selling prices. New orders are at an 11-month high as is business activity while year-ahead expectations are at their best level in a year-and-a-half. Backlogs are also piling up. This report points to a very solid fourth-quarter start for the bulk of the economy.' 
Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, October 20, 2016: 'The sharp gain in the prior week was no fluke for the consumer comfort index which, unlike other readings on confidence, has been picking up steam going into next week's presidential election' [ Econoday ]. 
Chain Store Sales, October 2016: 'Chain stores are reporting mixed sales in October, results that offer little guidance for monthly change in core retail sales (ex-food ex-gas)' [ Econoday ]. 
Shipping: 'Top North America TEU negative performance worsened through September' [James Sands, Seeking Alpha ]. 'The marginal decline was impacted by top ten North America seaport laden imports, while laden exports improved. The Hanjin bankruptcy impacted seaports broadly, most notably the Port of Long Beach. Class I rail container traffic has continued to mirror these trends with mixed results.' 
Shipping: '[Freignt forwarder] Panalpina has reported signs of an earlier-than-normal start to the end-of-year peak season in air freight partly as a result of the disruption to supply chains caused by the collapse of Korean container carrier Hanjin Shipping [ Lloyd's Loading List ]. ''Obviously, not all of the Hanjin ships have arrived at port and there is cargo meant to reach stores for Christmas is still 'floating',' said CEO Stefan Karlen. 'So some customers are getting concerned and because of that switching containers to air freight, and that's where the pick-up (in demand) is coming from.'' 
Shipping: 'With the ocean cargo sector effectively going from 4 alliances to 3, when the Ocean Alliance takes effect in April 2017, the further concentration should enable the alliances, within themselves, to better control capacity as a means to improving revenue' [ Logistics Management ]. One thing cartels are for… 
Shipping: 'We will behave ourselves, say Ocean Alliance members' [ Lloyd's List ]. 'Ocean Alliance members have vowed to be more disciplined in the area of new tonnage in an effort to tackle the overcapacity that has depressed the container shipping market.' 
Shipping: 'Dire safety conditions revealed in wake of Gadani fire as death toll feared to surpass 100' [ Splash 247 ]. 'A fire, which has now killed at least 21 people, is still raging at Pakistan's Gadani ship recycling area with fears the eventual death toll could hit triple figures. An explosion occurred on Tuesday as a welder worked on a gas cylinder in a beached oil tanker. The explosion rapidly became an inferno with many workers trapped in the ship.' That is like a war, isn't it? From John Keegan's description, in The Price of Admiralty , of the battle of Jutland ('the last major battle fought primarily by battleships in world history'): 
Although not a war between states: 
Nasir Mansoor, deputy-general secretary of the National Trade Union Federation (NTUF), hit out at the absence of safety procedures at Gadani yesterday, saying the Indonesian ship's tanks had not been cleaned ahead of the scrapping starting. Moreover, Mansoor alleged the yard had just one ambulance, which was being actually used for transporting the officials' children to and from school. Mansoor said a total of 250 workers were working on the tanker when the explosion occurred. 
'We demand that a murder case be registered right away against the Ship Breakers' Association,' he said, calling for Rs3m compensation for each of the dead victims' families. 
Of course, given the givens, the explosion and the deaths follow from over-capacity as the night the day. And it's not as if the conditions at Gadani weren't common knowledge among elites. I remember reading this article in The Atlantic in 2014, and here's an image from it: 
So, in the beached tanker, ka-boom! Whenever you hear the word 'accident,' think to yourself: 'What do you mean, 'accident'?' Oh, and there's this little detail: 
The floating oil production tanker, ACES (IMO # 8021830), was sold to the Gadani shipbreaker by Jakarta-based PT Sinar Mentari Prima and was used in the Jabung Batanghari terminal owned by the Indonesian government company BPMIGAS and operated by PetroChina. The change of flag and name of the ship happened just weeks before it reached the beach of Gadani, which strongly point towards the use of a cash buyer for the sale of the end-of-life vessel. 
Hmm. An unnamed 'cash buyer.' Seems like Richard Smith territory… 
Rail: 'U.S. rail traffic slump continued in October' [ Progressive Railroading ]. 'U.S. railroads logged a 3.2 percent decrease in carload and intermodal traffic last month compared with October 2015, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) reported yesterday… Excluding coal, carloads fell 3.8 percent last month compared with a year ago.' 
Commodities: 'Cobalt is the element found within lithium-ion batteries that allows them to generate more power over a longer time-period than normal batteries and it has already powered a consumer tech revolution over the last decade. It is the catalyst for the imminent commercialisation of electric cars, the reason your smartphone doesn't need charging every half hour, and the reason you can read your kindle cable free during that long plane journey' [ FCPA Blog ]. 'But cobalt raises several compliance challenges. it is overwhelmingly found in one country — the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Around 60% of global supply of cobalt comes from the DRC. Cobalt doesn't currently fall under the SEC's Dodd-Frank section 1502 covering conflict minerals and there is no specific compliance regulations attached to the sourcing of the mineral. But the lack of scrutiny by regulators seems likely to change in the near future as demand for cobalt and understanding of its sourcing increases.' 
ETFs: 'This Year's Most Innovative New ETFs' [ETFs.com]. 'Innovative'? Uh-oh…. 'Some of this year's most innovative exchange-traded funds are ones that look at gender diversity as a way to boost corporate performance, generic drugs and even using crowdsourcing to make bets on which stocks will outperform from month to month.' Seems frothy. 
Today's Fear & Greed Index: 17 Fear (previous close: 18, Fear) [ CNN ]. One week ago: 46 (Neutral). (0 is Extreme Fear; 100 is Extreme Greed). Last updated Nov 3 at 11:31am. Still waiting for single digits. 
Gaia 
'Michael Pollan Explains Why Psychedelic Drugs Are the Ultimate Meal for Your Mind' [ Mother Jones ]. News you can use! 
Imperial Collapse Watch 
'Today's understanding of the British Empire has been shaped by state secrecy and the destruction of historical records' [ Jacobin ]. 'There was no moment of reckoning — unless you dig a little deeper, it appears if Britain simply handed official control over the governance of its colonies to locals. As a result, not only does British imperialism receive exaltation and eulogy, but the postcolonial melancholia that afflicts public political culture is premised on the idea it was built on virtue and the diligence, strength, and courage of British people.' 
Class Warfare 
''I WANT MY COUNTRY BACK'' [ Pandaemonium ]. Here's the British variant of the Acela-rider's 'Trump voters are stupid' meme: 
Shortly after the referendum, a meme began to trend. Following the Leave vote there had been a spike in people googling 'What is the EU?'. Many Remainers took this to be proof of the ignorance of those voting Leave. In fact fewer than 1000 people googled 'What is the EU?' and there was no evidence that that a single person who had googled the question had voted Leave. Yet supporters of the EU continued to propagate this as evidence of the ignorance of Leave voters. If it was evidence of anything it was, perhaps, that an education is no insurance against cognitive bias, no protection against a willingness to be swayed by one's prejudices, no shield against a tendency to jump to conclusions not warranted by the facts. 
Well worth a read.

To say that this is the election from hell is to insult hell. 
There's been nothing like this since Washington forded the Rubicon or Trump crossed the Delaware or delivered the Gettysburg Address (you know, the one that began 'Four score and eleven women ago…') — or pick your own seminal moment in American history. 
Billions of words, that face, those gestures, the endless insults , the abused women and the emails, the 24/7 spectacle of it all… Whatever happens on Election Day, let's accept one reality: we're in a new political era in this country. We just haven't quite taken it in. Not really. 
Forget Donald Trump. 
Doh! Why did I write that? Who could possibly forget the first presidential candidate in our history preemptively unwilling to accept election results? (Even the South in 1860 accepted the election of Abraham Lincoln before trying to wave goodbye to the Union.) Who could forget the man who claimed that abortions could take place on the day of or the day before actual birth? Who could forget the man who claimed in front of an audience of nearly 72 million Americans that he had never met the women who accused him of sexual aggression and abuse, including the People magazine reporter who interviewed him? Who could forget the candidate who proudly cited his positive polling results at rallies and in tweets, month after month, before (when those same polls turned against him) discovering that they were all ' rigged '? 
Whatever you think of The Donald, who in the world — and I mean the whole wide world (including the Iranians ) — could possibly forget him or the election he's stalked so ominously? When you think of him, however, don't make him the cause of American political dysfunction. He's just the bizarre, disturbed, and disturbing symptom of the transformation of the American political system. 
Admittedly, he is a one-of-a-kind 'politician,' even among his associates in surging right-wing nationalist and anti-whatever movements globally. He makes France's Marine Le Pen seem like the soul of rationality and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte look like a master tactician of our age. But what truly makes Donald Trump and this election season fascinating and confounding is that we're not just talking about the presidency of a country, but of the country. The United States remains the great imperial state on Planet Earth in terms of the reach of its military and the power of its economy and culture to influence the workings of everything just about everywhere. And yet, based on the last strange year of election campaigning, it's hard not to think that something — and not just The Donald — is unnervingly amiss on Planet America. 
The World War II Generation in 2016 
Sometimes, in my fantasies (as while watching the final presidential debate), I perform a private miracle and bring my parents back from the dead to observe our American world. With them in the room, I try to imagine the disbelief many from that World War II generation would surely express about our present moment. Of course, they lived through a devastating depression, light years beyond anything we experienced in the Great Recession of 2007-2008, as well as a global conflagration of a sort that had never been experienced and — short of nuclear war — is not likely to be again. 
Despite this, I have no doubt that they would be boggled by our world and the particular version of chaos we now live with. To start at a global level, both my mother (who died in 1977) and my father (who died in 1983) spent decades in the nuclear age, the era of humanity's greatest — for want of a better word — achievement. After all, for the first time in history, we humans took the apocalypse out of the hands of God (or the gods), where it had resided for thousands of years, and placed it directly in our own. What they didn't live to experience, however, was history's second potential deal-breaker, climate change, already bringing upheaval to the planet, and threatening a slow-motion apocalypse of an unprecedented sort. 
While nuclear weapons have not been used since August 9, 1945 , even if they have spread to the arsenals of numerous countries, climate change should be seen as a snail-paced version of nuclear war — and keep in mind that humanity is still pumping near-record levels of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. I imagine my parents' amazement that the most dangerous and confounding issue on the planet didn't get a single question , not to speak of an answer, in the three presidential debates of 2016, the four and a half hours of charges, insults, and interruptions just past. Neither a moderator, nor evidently an undecided voter (in the town hall second debate), nor either presidential candidate — each ready to change the subject on a moment's notice from embarrassing questions about sexual aggression, emails, or anything else — thought it worth the slightest attention. It was, in short, a problem too large to discuss, one whose existence Donald Trump (like just about every other Republican) denies, or rather, in his case, labels a 'hoax' that he uniquely blames on a Chinese plot to sink America. 
So much for insanity (and inanity) when it comes to the largest question of all. On a somewhat more modest scale, my mom and dad wouldn't have recognized our political world as American, and not just because of Donald Trump. They would have been staggered by the money pouring into our political system — at least $6.6 billion in this election cycle according to the latest estimate, more than 10% of that from only 100 families. They would have been stunned by our 1% elections ; by our new Gilded Age ; by a billionaire TV celebrity running as a 'populist' by riling up once Democratic working-class whites immiserated by the likes of him and his 'brand' of casino capitalism, scam, and spectacle; by all those other billionaires pouring money into the Republican Party to create a gerrymandered Congress that will do their obstructionist bidding; and by just how much money can be 'invested' in our political system in perfectly legal ways these days. And I haven't even mentioned the Other Candidate, who spent all of August on the true 'campaign trail,' hobnobbing not with ordinary Americans but with millionaires and billionaires (and assorted celebrities ) to build up her phenomenal ' war chest .' 
I would have to take a deep breath and explain to my parents that, in twenty-first-century America, by Supreme Court decree, money has become the equivalent of speech, even if it's anything but 'free.' And let's not forget that other financial lodestone for an American election these days: the television news, not to speak of the rest of the media. How could I begin to lay out for my parents, for whom presidential elections were limited fall events, the bizarre nature of an election season that starts with media speculation about the next-in-line just as the previous season is ending, and continues more or less nonstop thereafter? Or the spectacle of talking heads discussing just about nothing but that election 24/7 on cable television for something like a full year, or the billions of ad dollars that have fueled this never-ending Super Bowl of campaigns, filling the coffers of the owners of cable and network news? 
We've grown strangely used to it all, but my mom and dad would undoubtedly think they were in another country — and that would be before they were even introduced to the American system as it now exists, the one for which Donald Trump is such a bizarre front man. 
What Planet Is This Anyway? 
I wish I still had my high school civics text. If you're of a certain age, you'll remember it: the one in which a man from Mars lands on Main Street, USA, to be lectured on the glories of American democracy and our carefully constructed, checked-and-balanced tripartite form of governance. I'm sure knowledge of that system changed life on Mars for the better, even if it was already something of a fantasy here on Earth in my parents' time. After all, Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower — my mom and dad voted for Democrat Adlai Stevenson — was the one who, in his farewell address in 1961, first brought 'the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power' and 'the military-industrial complex' to the attention of the American people. 
Yes, all of that was already changing then, as a peacetime war state of unparalleled size developed in this country. Still, 30-odd years after my father's death, surveying the American landscape, my parents might believe themselves on Mars. They would undoubtedly wonder what exactly had happened to the country they knew. After all, thanks to the Republican Party's scorched-earth tactics in these last years in bipolar Washington, Congress, that collection of putative representatives of the people (now a crew of well-paid, well-financed representatives of the country's special interests in a capital overrun with corporate lobbyists), hardly functions anymore. Little of significance makes it through the porticos of the Capitol. Recently, for instance, John McCain (usually considered a relatively 'moderate' Republican senator) suggested — before walking his comments part way back — that if Hillary Clinton were elected president, his fellow Republican senators might decide a priori not to confirm a single Supreme Court justice she nominated during her tenure in office. That, of course, would mean a court now down to what looks like a permanent crew of eight would shrink accordingly. And his comments, which once would have shocked Americans to the core, caused hardly a ripple of upset or protest. 
On my tour of this new world, I might start by pointing out to my mom and dad that the U.S. is now in a state of permanent war , its military at the moment involved in conflicts in at least six countries in the Greater Middle East and Africa. These are all purely presidential conflicts, as Congress no longer has a real role in American war-making (other than ponying up the money for it and beating the drums to support it). The executive branch stands alone when it comes to the war powers once checked and balanced in the Constitution. 
And I wouldn't want my parents to simply look abroad. The militarization of this country has proceeded apace and in ways that, I have not the slightest doubt, would shock them to their core. I could take my parents, for instance, to Grand Central Station in midtown Manhattan, their hometown and still mine, and on any day of the week they would see the once-inconceivable: actual armed soldiers on guard in full camo. I could mention that, at my local subway stop, I've several times noted a New York police department counterterror squad that could be mistaken for a military Special Ops team, assault rifles slung across their chests, and no one even stops and gawks anymore. I could point out that the police across the country increasingly have the look of military units and are supplied by the Pentagon with actual weaponry and equipment directly off distant U.S. battlefields, including armored vehicles of various sorts. I could mention that military surveillance drones, those precursors of future robotic warfare (and, for my parents, right out of the childhood sci-fi novels I used to read), are now regularly in American skies ; that advanced surveillance equipment developed in far-off war zones is now being used by the police here at home; and that, though political assassination was officially banned in the post-Watergate 1970s, the president now commands a formidable CIA drone force that regularly carries out such assassinations across large swaths of the planet, even against U.S. citizens , and without the say-so of anyone outside the White House, including the courts. I could mention that the president who, in my parents' time, commanded one modest-sized secret army, the CIA's paramilitaries, now essentially presides over a full-scale secret military, the Special Operations Command: 70,000 elite troops cocooned inside the larger U.S. military, including elite teams ready to be deployed on what are essentially executive missions across the planet. 
I could point out that, in the twenty-first century, U.S. intelligence has set up a global surveillance state that would have shamed the totalitarian powers of the previous century and that American citizens, en masse, are included in it; that our emails (a new concept for my parents) have been collected by the millions and our phone records made available to the state; that privacy, in short, has essentially been declared un-American. I would also point out that, on the basis of one tragic day and what otherwise has been the most modest of threats to Americans, a single fear — of Islamic terrorism — has been the pretext for the building of the already existing national security state into an edifice of almost unbelievable proportions that has been given once unimaginable powers, funded in ways that should amaze anyone (not just visitors from the American past), and has become the unofficial fourth branch of the U.S. government without either discussion or a vote. 
Little that it does — and it does a lot — is open to public scrutiny. For their own 'safety,''the People' are to know nothing of its workings (except what it wants them to know). Meanwhile, secrecy of a claustrophobic sort has spread across significant parts of the government. The government classified 92 million documents in 2011 and things seem not to have gotten much better since. In addition, the national security state has been elaborating a body of ' secret law '— including classified rules, regulations, and interpretations of already existing law — kept from the public and, in some cases, even from congressional oversight committees. 
Americans, in other words, know ever less about what their government does in their name at home and abroad. 
I might suggest to my parents that they simply imagine the Constitution of the United States being rewritten and amended in secrecy and on the fly in these years without as much as a nod to 'We, the People.' In this way, as our elections became elaborate spectacles, democracy was sucked dry and ditched in all but name — and that name is undoubtedly Donald J. Trump. 
Consider that, then, a brief version of how I might describe our new American world to my amazed parents. 
America as a National Security State 
None of this is The Donald's responsibility. In the years in which a new American system was developing, he was firing people on TV. You could, of course, think of him as the poster boy for an America in which spectacle, celebrity, the gilded class of One Percenters, and the national security state have melded into a narcissistic, self-referential brew of remarkable toxicity. 
Whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump is elected president, one thing is obvious: the vast edifice that is the national security state, with its 17 intelligence agencies and enormous imperial military, will continue to elaborate itself and expand its power in our American world. Both candidates have sworn to pour yet more money into that military and the intelligence and Homeland Security apparatus that goes with it. None of this, of course, has much of anything to do with American democracy as it was once imagined. 
Someday perhaps, like my parents, 'I' will be called back from the dead by one of my children to view with awe or horror whatever world exists. Long after the America of an unimaginable Donald J. Trump presidency or a far-more-imaginable Hillary Clinton version of the same has been folded into some god-awful, half-forgotten chapter in our history, I wonder what will surprise or confound 'me' then. What version of our country and planet will 'I' face in 2045? 0 0 0 0 0 0

by Outis Philalithopoulos At the beginning of this series , Outis' ghost embarked on a quest to explore possibly uncomfortable ideas about his identity as a progressive. In the previous episode , the Spirit of Liberalism Past abruptly vanished, and Outis found himself face to face with someone else. 'What a cute bunny,' I thought to myself. 'But why is she wearing a police uniform?' She stared at me with her big blue eyes and confidently held out her paw. Bemused, I took it. She softly shook my hand. 'Hopps, Judy Hopps,' she announced. 'Outis Philalithopoulos,' I responded slowly. 'And you are?' 'I am the Spirit of Liberalism Present!' 'I see,' I replied. 'Have you seen my movie?' 'I'm afraid I'm dead,' I confessed. 'So?' she responded undeterred. 'So I haven't seen it.' Her face fell. 'Oh,' she said. Then she brightened again. 'You just have to see it. The New York Times said it was 'irresistible.' And 'delightful.' And 'thought-provoking.' Not to mention 'full of savvy jokes.' Rolling Stone said that it might be 'the most subversive movie of the year.'' 'That sounds nice,' I said. ' And it's on track to become the second highest grossing movie of the year,' she noted proudly. Hesitantly, I said, 'I don't mean this the wrong way, but are you sure you're the right Spirit? Or that you weren't sent to the wrong person?' She stared at me sternly. 'Maybe you think that because I'm a bunny I can't be a real Spirit?' 'No, no!' I protested. 'I just wondered what you were going to show me.' 'Oh! Yes. Yes! My movie. Let's go!' She grabbed my wrist and in a whirl, I was whisked away. I found myself in a movie theater, where an animated movie called Zootopia was playing, with Judy in the starring role. Watching the movie The city of Zootopia was a beautiful place to live. It was populated by animals who had evolved so they were all vegetarians. Their economy seemed mostly like our own, with buying and selling and corporations and advertising – but no poor people. There was, however, one problem in Zootopia, which was that some animals believed hurtful and wrong things about other animals. In particular, some animals thought that predators still had different DNA from non-predators and so were inherently violent. Also, animals often assumed that bunnies were cute, dumb, fluffy things who couldn't do anything serious. This was annoying to Judy, but the first two thirds of the movie show her convincing even animals who underestimate her that she is exceptional. She wants to become a police officer, even though the conventional wisdom is that bunnies can't become cops. She ignores this and becomes valedictorian of the police academy. When she starts work, the police chief doesn't recognize her ability immediately and puts her on parking duty. Although she is understandably offended at having to do this sort of work, she resolves to show he was wrong about her, and so instead of handing out 100 tickets like she was told to do, she gives out 200 , all before her lunch break. She starts fighting back. She goes over the police chief's head and gets herself an assignment more reflective of her true abilities. One time, a fox named Nick had tricked her about something and then laughed at her for being liberal and naive. Now she evens the score – she threatens to have Nick thrown in jail for tax violations, and using this leverage, gets him to follow her all over town. She makes him illegally enter private property and go places where he feels threatened. 'What a strong, intrepid character,' I thought to myself. As time passes, Nick starts to appreciate how awesome Judy is, and they become friends. She exposes a scandal and everyone realizes that she's a great cop. Right in that moment, though, she comes face to face with a second adversary: her unconscious mind. In the midst of a press conference, Judy gets asked an awkward question about why the animals involved in a series of incidents were all predators. She doesn't think about what the right thing to say is, and the first thing that pops into her head is that maybe it's because predators have different DNA than non-predators. It's just what the anti-predator animals wanted her to say, and it makes Nick feel terrible. Anti-predator prejudice explodes, although thankfully pop stars speak out against it. Judy tries to get Nick to help her fix things, but Nick is still furious with her. Judy pleads with him: Wait, listen… I-I know you'll never forgive me, and I don't blame you. I wouldn't forgive me either. I was ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded. But predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes. I have to fix this. But I can't do it without you. And after we're done, you can hate me, [begins to cry] and… and that'll be fine, because I was a horrible friend, and I hurt you, and you… and you can walk away knowing that you were right all along – I really am just a dumb bunny. Nick forgives her then, and things work out. They expose a plot by the anti-predator animals, and send the leader, an evil sheep, to jail. All conflict melts away as the animals dance together to the pop singer's finale. After the movie 'What did you think?' the Spirit Judy asked me excitedly. 'I'm just so impressed,' I told her. She grinned. 'Who would have thought that a billion-dollar corporation like Disney would have the courage to make such a strong statement in support of progressive values?' I went on. 'I know!' she said. 'It did a great job showing how little things that we don't think of as bad can be hurtful to others. For example, while you were in the big city, you were carrying around a thing like a can of mace that was made to drive away foxes. And it sort of helped you to feel safe…' She blushed, ashamed. 'But it made Nick feel bad, because it implied I thought foxes were dangerous.' 'It showed how our attitudes can really affect people's lives. For example, Nick was making his living as a crook, and you might have thought that it was because times were hard and he had difficulty finding a job…' Judy nodded soberly. 'But actually,' she said, 'it was all because when he was very young, he had wanted to be nice and good. But then some of the other young animals just assumed that since he was a fox, he had to be untrustworthy, and so he was like, 'well, then I might as well be untrustworthy.' ' 'In general, your movie didn't play it safe,' I said. 'For example, you're an open-minded bunny and you always try to treat others with respect. But still, one time you carelessly said something that was really not good. And then, the only way you could return to being a good bunny was to convince yourself that you were truly a bad bunny, and say so publicly.' 'Oh, yeah,' Judy said. 'Even though I'm really embarrassed that I said those horrible things, at least this way I could model for the children watching the movie how they ought to act when they say something wrong.' 'The movie definitely delved into difficult issues,' I agreed. 'At the same time, it had plenty of humor. Like there was that time you go to the DMV, and the employees there, the sloths, just operate in a lower gear than the rest of us. Which was hilarious for anyone who's had to deal with real life public employees.' Judy shook her head. 'I was in a hurry and it was just so frustrating. But I know I shouldn't let it bother me – they can't help it.' 'The movie often combined humor and teaching moments. Like there was the really, really fat police dispatcher, so I just assumed he eats doughnuts all the time. And then he calls you a cute bunny, and you're very patient with him, and are like, 'Ooh, uh, you probably didn't know, but a bunny can call another bunny cute, but when other animals do it, it's a little…' And so you deftly addressed the theme of political correctness, but it didn't feel preachy because then there was a light-hearted moment…' 'Right,' Judy laughed, 'because he really did have a doughnut stuck in the fat folds of his neck.' 'Or when they put the evil sheep in jail at the end,' I went on, 'and the other inmates touch her wool 'cause it's soft and fluffy, which makes her really mad, because as you explained earlier in the movie…' '… touching a sheep's wool is a microaggression and it's not okay,' Judy supplied helpfully. 'But she was xenophobic and hurt a lot of people, so when her wool gets touched, technically it's wrong…' 'But it's also kind of funny,' I concluded. 'Another way the movie used humor was to show how it isn't smart to be prejudiced. For example, your parents sometimes said prejudiced things, but that didn't make us want to be like them, because after all – I mean, not to be critical or anything – they're rural, they have a really big family, they're always saying 'gosh' and 'amen to that,' they don't really have ambitions…' Judy fought back a smile. 'Yeah, I love them to death, but they're kind of old-fashioned.' 'And so the movie shows,' I went on, 'how when you have wrong ideas, your kids just won't listen to you. Like when you were little, they would try to give you advice, and you would just wander off and they wouldn't even notice you were gone. Or there was that scene where they tried to get you to bring fox repellent with you to the big city – because a fox had beaten you up one time, and they were worried it would happen again. And you knew that carrying fox repellent was prejudiced, but finally you just said, 'I will take this – to make you stop talking.'' Judy laughed. 'They mean well, they really do – it's just that there are some things they don't really understand.' 'On a side note,' I added, 'I think it's really awesome how even though you're a bunny, you really have the mannerisms of white Millennial upper-middle-class girls down cold.' 'Thanks!' she said. 'And it just goes to show,' I continued excitedly, 'that the right-wingers are totally wrong about us when they say we want to stamp out gender roles and make women exactly like men!' 'What… do… you… mean?' she said, her voice full of warning notes. I went on obliviously. 'I just mean, you do lots of things in the movie that they wouldn't have guys do. Like for example, you force Nick to follow you around and do whatever you tell him, and that's awesome 'cause it showcases how you're a strong female character, but if he had forced you to follow himaround…' 'That would be controlling and creepy and horrible!' she exclaimed. 'Obviously. But Nick wouldn't do that. So what's your point?' I wasn't sure if this conversation was going in a good direction. Instead, I said, 'Actually, I'm worried – maybe your time is short. In case we get cut off, what is the most important thing you want me to learn from your visit?' She looked at her watch. 'Oh, yes. Yes. I do have to go,' she said. Then she smiled at me warmly. 'My final message is, if anyone ever tells you you can't do anything, or you can't be anything, don't believe them. You can .' I looked at her, stricken. 'But Judy, I'm dead.' She looked quizzically at me. 'So? Look, I know a lot of people assume that dead people can't do certain things, just because they're dead. But don't listen to them. Follow your dreams!' And with a peal of thunder, she was gone, and I was back in the livid marshes. * * * The series will take a break for the weekend and resume Monday, at which point Outis will succeed at putting it all together – sort of.

Mark Warner, Virginia Ron Wyden, Oregon 
In both houses of Congress, these were the barest of margins — 218 Yes votes in the House and 60 Yes votes in the Senate, in each case exactly the minimum required for passage. Another indication of how toxic this 'trade' bill is. No Democrat dared touch it who didn't want to or have to. 
Black Lives Matter and the TPP 
And now the TPP has become even more toxic, since the Black Lives Matter (BLM) social-justice movement has endorsed the anti-TPP position. Politico Pro has this (sub. required; my emphasis): 
Obama's latest TPP foe: Black Lives Matter By Andrew Hanna Monday, Oct. 31, 2016 
The Obama administration will face an unexpected adversary as it gears up for what could be a blockbuster lame-duck fight over the Trans-Pacific Partnership: the Black Lives Matter movement. 
The group — best known best for its protests of police shootings of African-Americans — has joined the fray over the Asian Pacific trade deal as part of its growing focus on economic issues, contending the pact would lead to greater racial injustice . It ties past trade deals to the closures of factories that have hurt black workers disproportionately and increased black poverty . 
Its involvement could influence the votes of a handful of wavering Democrats, should Congress tackle TPP during the lame duck. 
'There are groups that are going to pay a lot of close attention to what they say, especially the Congressional Black Caucus,' said Bill Reinsch, a fellow at the Stimson Center and close trade-vote watcher. 
Only a small band of 28 House Democrats voted to give the president fast track authority to complete TPP, including three members of the Congressional Black Caucus: Reps. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) and Terri Sewell (D-Ala.). A fourth black caucus member, Republican Mia Love of Utah, also voted for fast-track authority. 
With anti-trade fervor whipped into a fever pitch by the presidential election campaign, their votes are considered key to passage of the pact — and all are under increasing pressure to abandon the president should the pact come to a ratification vote. 
The pretend reason, of course, for TPP support is support for a major legacy 'want' by the first black president. The pro-Clinton members of the Democratic Platform Committee, for example, resisted to the end any explicit language about TPP on the grounds that the Party must support its president. 
Democrats Prioritize Party Unity Over Including Stand Against TPP In Platform 
Members of the Democratic National Convention Platform Committee shot down an attempt to include specific opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal in the platform, despite the fact that both Democratic presidential candidates have taken positions against the TPP. 
The attempt failed because members appointed by Hillary Clinton and DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz claimed it was improper to oppose the TPP when President Barack Obama fervently believes in the agreement. However, by putting party unity before taking a firm stand against the trade agreement, the door was left open for Clinton to go back to supporting the TPP , which was the case when she was secretary of state. 
'It is hard for me to understand why Secretary Clinton's delegates won't stand behind Secretary Clinton's positions in the party's platform,' Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said…. 
Even platform committee chair, Representative E.J. Cummings [normally progressive on trade issues], chose to vote against the resolution. He, too, bragged about not voting for trade agreements. 
'I don't want to do anything as he ends his term to undercut the president of the United States. I'm just not going to do it. And that's where I stand,' Cummings proclaimed. 
That's the pretend reason — supporting the first black president — for most of them anyway. The real reason is different and not unexpected — money and everything money can buy. The Democratic Party as it's currently configured exists to enable the fire hose flow of corporate and big-wealth dollars into its coffers. Opposing that flow gets you the 'Sanders treatment,' but I'm not spilling any new beans in saying that. 
This move by Black Lives Matter takes away the pretend reason and thus puts some careers at risk. BLM has high visibility at the moment. It will be worth watching the result, the actual TPP vote, as this plays out later. 
What to Watch For in the Lame Duck 
Once the Democrats figure out how many Republicans will defect from their leadership in each house of Congress (there were 50 House Republican defections last time plus six not voting, and five Senate defections plus two not voting), they'll know how many Democrats will have to 'take one for the team' — vote Yes on TPP so others with reputations to protect (like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ) don't have to. 
The numbers needed to pass TPP in the Senate have changed this time. Only 51 votes are needed there now (that's part of what 'fast track' means). Finding 50 No votes in the Senate is not an impossible task, but it's a very high bar — depending on the way Republicans vote, as few as four 'Democrats' like Ron Wyden could guarantee passage. 
So the greatest vulnerability for TPP is in the House . Can Democrats again muster something like 28 pro-corporate votes? Which Democrats will chose to take the fall a second time? Corporatists like Ron Kind will eagerly comply. But will Earl Blumenauer ( bow-tie bicycle guy )? Will CBC members Sewell and Johnson, with BLM lobbying hard against them? Or will other House Democrats be needed (and willing) to take the fall so Pelosi can move TPP across the line? 
Again, Fast Track passed the House with zero votes to spare. What if the Republican opposition — including the opposition to Speaker Ryan in the wake of the Trump debacle — swells to more than 50? This could be a very close vote. 
TPP, Obama's Legacy and 'A Glide Path to His Life as an Ex-President' 
The Politico article quoted above helpfully notes this about Obama's legacy: 
If successfully pushed through Congress, ratification of the trade accord would be the last major piece of legislation of the Obama presidency. The prospect that black lawmakers and activists could help to hand him a defeat is complicated by Obama's position as the first black president. 
' This is part of President Obama's legacy ,' said [CBC member Gregory] Meeks. 
Will Barack Obama get his legacy wish, along with his legacy library and foundation? The New York Times a few weeks ago told us this about Obama's future plans and needs: 
Publicly, Mr. Obama betrays little urgency about his future. Privately, he is preparing for his postpresidency with the same fierce discipline and fund-raising ambition that characterized the 2008 campaign that got him to the White House. 
The long-running dinner this past February is part of a methodical effort taking place inside and outside the White House as the president, first lady and a cadre of top aides map out a postpresidential infrastructure and endowment they estimate could cost as much as $1 billion . The president's aides did not ask any of the guests for library contributions after the dinner, but a number of those at the table could be donors in the future…. 
So far, Mr. Obama has raised just over $5.4 million from 12 donors, with gifts ranging from $100,000 to $1 million. Michael J. Sacks, a Chicago businessman, gave $666,666. Fred Eychaner, the founder of Chicago-based Newsweb Corp., which owns community newspapers and radio stations, donated $1 million. Mark T. Gallogly, a private equity executive, and James H. Simons, a technology entrepreneur, each contributed $340,000 to a foundation set up to oversee development of the library. 
The real push for donations, foundation officials said, will come after Mr. Obama leaves the White House . 
Shailagh Murray, a senior adviser, oversees an effort inside the White House to keep attention on Mr. Obama's future and to ensure that his final 17 months in office, barring crises, serve as a glide path to his life as an ex-president . 
'A glide path to his life as an ex-president.' I guess you could call him, after his 2008 trademark, 'ever hopeful and looking for change' Interesting times indeed. 0 0 0 0 0 0

TPP: A Podesta mail where Nikki Budzinski, Labor Outreach Director, discusses Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson: 'I have received four calls from labor about a district meeting that Congresswoman Johnson (a HRC public supporter) held in Dallas, Texas where she discussed TPP. She claimed in the meeting that she speaks with HRC 2-3 times a week and that she was told by the Secretary that the only reason she opposes TPP is to get 'labor off her back' and that once she is elected President she will reverse position. I have worked with our Western Political Director Jessica Meija, and she has connected with the Congresswoman's COS to clarify the inaccuracy of what she said and push back on her comments. This was not helpful with labor. [ Wikileaks (attachment)]. 'Inaccuracy.' Of course, of course. 
TPP: '[Our Revolution,] the progressive group founded by Sen. Bernie Sanders has begun a targeted campaign to sway at least five House Democrats to oppose the TPP in hopes it could change the outcome of a ratification vote — and it's getting some results' [ Politico ]. 'Our Revolution, which Sanders formed in late August to support liberal candidates, has set its sights on at least five other fence-sitting lawmakers. In a vote that's expected to have razor-thin margins, plundering just a few Democratic votes the White House hoped to gain could make all the difference. The target list includes Reps. Seth Moulton (Mass.), Ed Perlmutter (Colo.), Beto O'Rourke (Texas), Derek Kilmer (Wash.), and Pennsylvania state Rep. Dwight Evans.' 
TPP: 'In Thursday, Obama's Council of Economic Advisers published a report warning that if the TPP isn't passed, a China-backed trade agreement will takes its place. That could put U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage when they try to sell to customers in Japan and other Asian nations. The report argues that if China's Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership goes into effect, at least 35 U.S. industries as diverse as plastics, fishing and footwear will be at risk of increased competition from China in the Japanese market' [ FiveThirtyEight ]. So they've settled on this messaging, now? And: '[I]f Clinton wins, Obama might be able to put together a coalition of Republicans and trade-friendly Democrats* to support the treaty. In other words, TPP isn't dead yet.' * Especially those looking for jobs on K Street. 
TPP: ''If TPP is not passed and RCEP is enacted, which is what all these countries say they are planning to do, then U.S. businesses would face a direct loss of competitive position,' said Jason Furman, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers' [ Reuters ]. 'This would displace U.S. goods and be worse than simply maintaining the trade status quo, Furman said. The study identifies 35 industrial sectors employing 4.7 million people with $5.3 billion in sales to Japan that would face such a disadvantage.' 
TPP: 'Japan's ruling parties push TPP through committee after opposition walkout' [ Nikkei Asian Review ]. 'The next hurdle for the trade deal is a vote during a plenary session of the House of Representatives, expected early next week. It will then be sent to the Diet's upper house, the House of Councillors.' 
TPP: 'Working-class U.S. residents already lose about $1,800 annually because wages have been depressed by global competition on labor rates, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. TPP would deepen this problem' [ Detroit Free Press ]. I know the cheap goods are supposed to make up for this, but when your jobs and and what you can afford to buy are both crapified….

''In keeping with the disgrace that was this trial, one of the things the U.S. Attorney's Office should be ashamed of is where it decided to draw the line on who to charge and who not to charge,' Baroni's attorney Michael] Baldassare said.

Our Famously Free Press 
'Behind all the Times' fawning profiles of Clinton — and the denigrating pieces not only on Trump but also Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders — was a cozy understanding between Times reporters and the Clinton campaign, WikiLeaks has shown us, that getting Clinton elected is something of a collaborative effort' [ MarketWatch ]. 'Editors at the Times, the Washington Post and elsewhere justify this hostility because they have determined that Trump is an existential threat to democracy and the worst presidential nominee in history and can't be treated as an ordinary candidate. So why do the polls show the worst nominee ever running neck-and-neck with the candidate President Barack Obama has praised as the most qualified person ever to run for president? Do these editors know something that tens of millions of American voters are missing? Whose job is it really to decide what poses a threat to our democracy — a handful of editors in the corporate media or the voters?'

'Trump is finishing the race the way many Republicans wished he could have run it from the start: fiercely on message and on offense' [ RealClearPolitics ]. 'Trump has largely adhered to his teleprompters and resisted controversial tweets this week. As Clinton campaigned a few days ago with Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe winner with whom Trump has infamously feuded, the GOP nominee focused primarily on higher costs for Obamacare and the revived FBI investigation into emails pertinent to Clinton's private server. The campaign believes those issues bolster his closing argument that Clinton is corrupt and a vestige of old politics, while he says he's an agent of change.' 
'Our polling data suggests that the missing whites aren't exactly conservative populists who support Mr. Trump. They're just dissatisfied: They don't like their candidate, and they don't like the other party's candidate much either' [ New York Times ].

'In the table below, I've run a head-to-head comparison showing how many electoral votes each candidate was projected to have at various margins of victory or defeat. For instance, Obama had a lead in states (and congressional districts) totaling 332 electoral votes in our final 2012 forecast. Clinton leads in states totaling only 272 electoral votes, just two more than the minimum she needs to win the Electoral College.' In brief, Clinton is stronger than Obama among highly educated voters in states that she would win anyhow , and weaker among white voters without college degrees in states that are close. 
War Drums 
'The U.S. government believes hackers from Russia or elsewhere may try to undermine next week's presidential election and is mounting an unprecedented effort to counter their cyber meddling, American officials told NBC News. The effort is being coordinated by the White House and the Department of Homeland Security, but reaches across the government to include the CIA, the National Security Agency and other elements of the Defense Department, current and former officials say' [ NBC ]. ' Officials are alert for any attempts to create Election Day chaos, and say steps are being taken to prepare for worst-case scenarios, including a cyber-attack that shuts down part of the power grid or the internet. But what is more likely, multiple U.S. officials say, is a lower-level effort by hackers from Russia or elsewhere to peddle misinformation by manipulating Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms. For example, officials fear an 11th hour release of fake documents implicating one of the candidates in an explosive scandal without time for the news media to fact check it. 
The Trail 
'With Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump breathtakingly close in polls of key states, analysts are beginning to factor in the possibility of recounts that would delay the outcome' [ MarketWatch ]. 'Bear in mind that a candidate would have limited time to contest the vote. This year, the Electoral College is due to meet on Dec. 19. By law, electors meet on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.' A recount would make Florida 2000 look like a walk in the park, especially because Clinton, bless her heart, is unlikely to let herself be rolled, unlike Gore. 
Michigan: 'Hillary Clinton is hanging onto a narrow 4-point lead over Donald Trump in Michigan heading into the last weekend before Tuesday's election, with a new Free Press poll showing clear momentum for the Republican nominee in a state that several weeks ago was believed all but decided for the Democrat' [ Detroit Free Press ]. ' [T]he number of undecided voters — 13% — remains extraordinarily high for this late in an election cycle, speaking to the high unfavorable marks voters give both major party candidates.' Normally, I'd say a 4% lead is a lot, but those undecideds. Wowsers. 
Realignment 
'Who Broke Politics?' [Paul Krugman, New York Times ]. 'So how did all our political norms get destroyed? Hint: It started long before Donald Trump. On one side….' Hint: You will read to the end of the column without finding the 'On the other side' that 'on one side' sets up. I mean, it wasn't mean Republicans who prevented Obama from throwing the banksters in jail, was it? 
'America and the Abyss' [Andrew Sullivan, New York Magazine ]. Of course, if Trump really were a fascist, the Democratic Establishment would fight him tooth and nail. Right? 
'Donald Trump didn't break one of our two great and ancestral political parties. He won the nomination because the Republican Party was already broken, and those responsible for the party, the elected officials and thinkers, didn't know. Now they do' [Peggy Noonan, Wall Street Journal , 'Democracy's Majesty and 2016's Indignity']. 'Soon they will begin that stage of political mourning known as the symposia process. They'll discuss how to repair, renew, keep the party together. Or the party will, over the next few cycles, split apart… The Democratic Party and its lobbyist/think-tank/journalistic establishment in Washington have long looked to me to be dominated by people devoted mostly to getting themselves in the best professional position and their kids into Sidwell Friends School. They want to be part of the web, the arrangement. They want to have connections, associates, a tong. They want to be wired in. They don't want to be I.F. Stone, alone, reading the fine print of obscure government documents. And Clintonism—for years the biggest web, the securest source of money, a real tong with enforcers and reward-dispensers—has long been a sound route to all of this. You may have to bend rules to be part of it, accept unsavory deals and characters, but it is warm and cozy in there.' And: 
One thing I saw this year was that sincere conservatives wholly opposed to socialism had real respect for Bernie Sanders because they saw his sincerity. He wasn't part of the web and they honored him for it. 
I never thought I'd find myself writing this, but for punditry I'll take Nooners over Krugman's hackery or Sullivan's hysterical ranting. It's been quite a year.

Stats Watch 
Employment Situation, October 2016: Unemployment Rate – Level (4.9 %); Participation Rate – level (62.8%) [ Econoday ]. 'Solid payroll growth is not the whole story of the October employment report. Average hourly earnings are rising, up an outsized 0.4 percent in the month with the year-on-year rate, at 2.8 percent, suddenly near 3.0 percent and at its recovery peak… The unemployment rate is down 1 tenth to 4.9 percent and, for some, is already signaling full employment for the labor market.But negatives are scarce in this report, where strength is emphatically underscored by the unexpected acceleration in average hourly earnings which further includes an upward revision to September. Today's report marks a solid opening to fourth-quarter data and will raise talk of a wage-inflation flashpoint…' Gotta take the punchbowl away from lower orders! But: ' The number of persons working part time for economic reasons was essentially unchanged in October. This level suggests slack still in the labor market' [ Calculated Risk ]. Moreover: 't's also worth noting that the standard measure of unemployment — now at 5 percent — doesn't capture the lingering weakness in the market seen in the broader U6 measure, which includes discouraged workers, other workers marginally attached to the labor force and those in temporary jobs because they can't get full-time work. The conventional unemployment measure is a hair below its mean from 2003-7, which is 5.2 percent. The broader U6, however, at 9.7 percent is higher than its 2003-7 mean of 9.1 percent. This is just another sign that there's still slack in the labor market.' [ Bloomberg ]. And: 'Should we believe the employment numbers in this report? There is little evidence of political bias in past election cycles' [ Econintersect ]. 'To sum this report up – employment is continuing to tread water – growing little better than the theoretical working population growth. However, note that the household survey removed 43,000 to the workforce (which is the reason the unemployment rate declined). There was really nothing good or nothing really terrible – although manufacturing declined. The year-over-year rate of growth significantly declined this month.' Again, the Econoday summary is just a little too breathless for this Maine bear. 
International Trade, September 2016: 'A decline in imports helped pull down the nation's trade gap sharply in September, to $36.4 billion from a revised $40.5 billion in August. Imports, reflecting declines for capital goods and also consumer goods, fell 1.1 percent while exports, showing an especially strong gain for capital goods, rose 0.6 percent' [ Econoday ]. 'Declining imports are a plus for the GDP calculation but are not signals of strength for domestic demand, whether business demand for capital goods or business expectations for consumer imports ahead of the holidays.' And: 'Declining imports are a plus for the GDP calculation but are not signals of strength for domestic demand, whether business demand for capital goods or business expectations for consumer imports ahead of the holidays' [ Econintersect ]. 
Jobless Claims: 'However, comparing initial claims today with the past is the proverbial apples to oranges. An important fact in looking at claims data is that vastly fewer people today are eligible for unemployment benefits. In other words, the number of unemployed people who can't receive jobless benefits — and thus are not in the initial claims data — has risen relative to those who have unemployment insurance' [ Bloomberg ]. As Mosler has been saying. 
Housing: 'Residential remodeling has recovered to 38% of the peak it attained prior to the Great Recession. New residential construction, on the other hand, is only at 17% of the peak' [ Econintersect ]. 
Retail: 'The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has just announced that Samsung is having to recall its top-load washing machines due to a risk of impact injuries. The exact hazard listed was that the washing machine top can unexpectedly detach from the washing machine chassis during use, posing a risk of injury from impact' [ 247 Wall Street ]. 'What matters here is that this will not be a cheap recall. You can drive a smartphone back to the store or mail it in cheaply. Have you ever tried moving a washing machine, or just dealing with getting a technician out to deliver or fix one? And the size of this recall is huge — about 2.8 million total units!' Korea is really having its troubles, isn't it? Samsung is a failing national champion, Hanjin went bankrupt, and there's a ginormous scandal with their President. 
Shipping: 'In August, the Intermodal Association of North America (IANA) reported its first quarterly volume decline for the first time after 25 straight quarters of growth. Earlier this week, marked its second straight quarterly volume decline, officially extending more of an unwelcome streak' [ Logistics Management ]. 'Total third quarter intermodal volume movements—at 4,348,634—were off 4.6 percent annually, following a 6.1 percent second quarter decline at 4,271,162. The first quarter of 2016 saw volumes rise 2.0 percent annually. … Like recent quarters, domestic containers were the lone metric to see an increase.' 
Shipping: 'Orders for heavy-duty commercial trucks in North America plummeted 46% in October from the same month last year, providing a grim outlook for truck manufacturers in the coming year' [ Wall Street Journal , 'Truck Orders Tumbled 46% in October ']. 'In an analyst note Thursday, Stifel said the October order total was the weakest since 2009, falling well below expectations. 'October orders are critical as they represent the traditional start to the order season for trucks to be produced the next year,' the report said.' 
Shipping: 'After four days [!!!] firefighters have finally managed to douse the terrible tanker blaze that killed many workers at a shipbreaking site in Gadani, Pakistan. Rescue work inside the hull of the Indonesian ship cannot start however as the steel plates are still too hot' [ Splash 247 ]. 'While there are now 21 confirmed dead, the eventual death toll could hit triple figures with many unaccounted for inside the hull of the ship and a number of the 60 workers sent to hospital deemed to have such severe burns that they are unlikely to survive.' The human cost of excess capacity. 
The Bezzle: 'GoPro's forward statements are not believable, in light of its recent performance, and management's ability to forecast. It is also essentially a one-product company, and that product does not sell very well' [ 247 Wall Street ]. 
The Bezzle: 'the app economy may have passed its peak. CB Insights analyzed the company descriptions of thousands of startup companies receiving VC funding for the first time between 2010 and today, scanning for buzzwords that describe the companies' field of focus. While 'app] is still the keyword that shows up in the most company descriptions, the share of startups working with apps in some way has declined for three straight years' [ Econintersect ]. 'Looking at the terms with the largest increase in mentions in startup company descriptions between 2010 and 2016 possibly allows us to glimpse into the future and gives us an idea of what the next big thing might be. According to CB Insights' analysis, these terms are 'virtual reality', 'machine learning' and 'natural language.'' I think reality is quite virtual enough already, thank you. 
The Fed: 'Central bank independence 'comes from an understanding of the macroeconomic policy problem that is not relevant to current times,' Summers said in a speech at the International Monetary Fund' [ MarketWatch ]. 'During the question-and-answer session, Summers said he did not think that entitlement reform should be on the immediate agenda for the next administration. He said that policy makers should focus solely on accelerating growth. If they are successful in sparking demand, the long-run debt-to-GDP ratio will be sustainable, he said. If policy makers fail, it will not be.'

Lower interest rates are not the reasons why rates of return on retirement savings for most households are low. High fees, undiversified liquid portfolios, and low net-of-tax returns are contributing factors. The low returns are the result of the failed structure of individual-directed, commercially-managed 401(k) and IRA plans. Because individuals in the bottom 60 percent or so of households get little tax relief due to their low marginal tax rate, the retirement accounts for the households at the bottom of the income distribution can easily earn negative real returns after deductions for fees are taken into account [8] . 
2) Lower interest rates force employers to increase funding contributions to pay for defined pension plans [9] . If employers must increase contributions to fund promised liabilities such as pensions and retiree health care, funds dedicated to employee compensation shift to finance post-employment obligations. Increased pension contributions add to labor costs and shift total compensation away from wages. Aggregate spending or demand consists of spending by households, businesses, government, and foreigners: the most important source is households — two-thirds of aggregate demand comes from households. [10] Most income to households takes the form of wages and salaries. Though labor income to the bottom 90 percent of households has been stagnant for over 30 years, [11] increased pension contributions suppresses current aggregate demand even further — especially in the public sector, where pay has only increased by less than 5 percent in the recovery, and in which the overall employment figure is 500,000 less than it was before the recovery, and 2 million lower than what we would have if public sector employment kept up with population increases and the economy. There are fewer IRS agents per tax dollar collected; fewer teachers; and U.S. Postal Service employees are at 1964 levles. [12] . 
In short, increased employer contributions to defined-benefit pension plans – though vitally important to ensure promised pensions are paid, have the unfortunate side effect of reducing aggregate demand, further weakening the economy. The Wisconsin pension fund and CalPERS, after being nervous about the riskiness in their bond fund, are taking the bold move of lowering their interest rate assumptions. That sets the stage for negative economic feedback effect in our low growth environment — more taxes or lower benefits or both. [13] 
3) Lower returns on assets lowers household wealth. The negative wealth effect lowers current spending, and makes a weak economy even weaker. [14] Without activist fiscal policy to overcome the suppression in wealth and spending, the economy only weakens and forces interest rates down, continuing the cycle. 
4) Low interest rates immediately suppress the buying power of seniors. Though most seniors in America do not obtain income directly from financial accounts, many still do. [15] Without activist fiscal policy, household consumption will be further suppressed, further slowing the economy. 
5) Portfolio managers are tempted to take greater risks to reach their investment targets, which in turn creates asset inflation — the U.S. stock market is trading at multiples similar to 2007, and the Case Shiller index is at pre-2007. This leads to financial destabilization and increased volatility. 
Harvard professors Bo Becker and Victoria Ivashina [16] found evidence that large institutional investors, like pension funds and insurance companies that have to meet a specific return target, often reach for yield by buying assets that promise high returns because the riskiness is not well measured. 
Since low interest rates prompt investors to take on below-the-radar risk, the system as a whole is exposed to greater risk [17] because of feedback loops — as billions of dollars are plowed into risky bonds, the yields are driven even lower. 'Reaching for yield' was a contributing factor to the financial crises of 2008. 
6) Low borrowing rates changes the relative price of capital over labor. Though substituting capital for labor because interest rates are low is not a practical problem for now – given the cash glut held by firms – low interest rates can encourage very low-value capital investment in the private sector. This is not a practical problem at present because firms are relatively uninterested in investing despite the low rates. But if the capital substitution occurs without an increase in demand, there will be labor displacement. 
Virtually every economist from the left or right is commenting on the failure of our collective will to borrow money in order to fund infrastructure when interest rates are so low. [18] The failure of Congress (and political leaders at the state and local level who can issue public debt) is the only cause of the increasing public-good deficit. The nation needs trillions of spending in infrastructure just to maintain the level of investment reached decades ago. [19] 
(A group of economists [20] are considering monetizing the debt [1] precisely because Congress won't act to invest long term. If the regulatory legal structure can be changed, the next president may have to bypass Congress and buy bonds directly from state and local governments. Clearly, pension funds would benefit directly from the supply of high-yielding government bonds.) 
7) The banking community is organizing to point out that a low interest rate destroys the business model for banks. [21] 
###p[22] We know permanent austerity leads to profound risks of permanent stagnation, but what is underappreciated is how household, investment and government reactions to the blunt, non-precise, and somewhat crude tool of permanent low interest rates will combine to cause enduring damage to the economy. Investors, especially institutional investors such as pension funds, should rise up and demand the combination of higher rates and the swift end of permanent austerity with bold public spending.

Assessing the trustworthiness of others is a ubiquitous and fundamental process. If these trustworthiness assessments translate into trusting behaviour , understanding how 'trust beliefs' are formed is consequential. The current US presidential election may hinge on voter assessments of the trustworthiness of candidates. The victims of the US investment fraudster Bernie Madoff are reminders of the potentially severe financial consequences of misallocated trust. 
Kenneth Arrow (1972) famously asserted that trust is a prerequisite for most economic activity. A large and lively body of research in economics focuses on trust and its aggregate economic consequences, documenting strong relationships between general levels of trust between nations and everything from GDP growth to cross-country trade patterns (Knack and Zak 2001, Knack and Keefer 1996, Guiso et al. 2004, Tabellini 2008, Algan and Cahuc 2010, Guiso et al. 2009). 
Despite the economic importance of trust, surprisingly little is known about what causes us to trust others. Although previous research suggests that both pecuniary and non-pecuniary factors ('betrayal' or 'control') play a role, it is not clear which non-pecuniary factors are particularly important or persistent, or precisely how these factors affect trust (Bohnet and Zeckhauser 2004, Cox 2004, Ashraf et al. 2006, Bohnet et al. 2008, Butler and Miller 2015, Bolton et al. 2016). 
Furthermore, while common sense dictates one determinant of trust must be trust beliefs, even less is known about what shapes these beliefs or their relationship, if any, with trusting behaviour. 
Moral Determinants of Trust and Trust Beliefs 
Our research is beginning to fill this gap. We use experimental evidence from the so-called 'trust game' to shed light on the determinants of trust and trust beliefs. In this game, one person (the 'sender') sends money to another person (the 'receiver'). The amount is increased when the receiver gets it. In turn, the receiver can return all, some or none to the sender. Because receivers are unconstrained in their decisions, senders' choices can plausibly be interpreted as trusting behaviour. 
Our results shed light on how, and to what extent, moral concerns drive trust. Building on previous research that found scope for non-pecuniary concerns, in Butler et al. (2016a) we elicit participants' subjective, individual notions of what constitutes 'cheating' in the context of a trust game experiment, and relate this to their behaviour in the same game. 
We find a large direct impact of moral concerns. While expected monetary returns play a large role in senders' decisions to trust, we estimate that the likelihood of ending up feeling cheated also significantly influences trusting behaviour. Surprisingly, the influence of moral concerns on how much individuals trust is comparable in magnitude to risk aversion, a more widely acknowledged determinant of this trust/investment decision. 
Notions of Cheating 
Having documented that moral considerations are an important direct determinant of trust, we also found indirect channels through which moral concerns may affect trusting behaviour. One such channel operates through senders' trust beliefs. We found that receivers try to not leave their (anonymous) co-players feeling cheated. Since there is no consensus on what cheating entails – we find wide variation in definitions of cheating, the patterns of which are interesting in their own right – this requires receivers to guess what senders would consider to be 'cheating'. 
How do they guess? Our evidence suggests that receivers' belief in what the senders would consider as cheating is strongly correlated with how receivers themselves define cheating. This is a pattern consistent with the psychological phenomenon of 'false consensus' (Ross et al. 1977) in which we tend to think that others are like us. 
Astoundingly, we find that senders apparently anticipate this thought process. We uncover a strong positive relationship between senders' own cheating definitions and how much money senders believe receivers will return to them. 
Since moral considerations, as manifested by subjective cheating definitions, play a strong direct and indirect role in trusting behaviour, the obvious question arises: where do these definitions come from? Our study suggests that cheating notions are affected by values instilled by parents. We surveyed participants about the values their parents taught them during their upbringing, and classified the list into two categories: Pro-social values, such as altruism and cooperation Pro-competitive values, such as striving to be better than others 
We find that pro-competitive values are strongly associated with higher cheating definitions – that is, needing higher monetary returns in order to not feel cheated – while pro-social values substantially relax, or lower, cheating definitions. 
Real-World Implications of Experimental Findings 
Are there any real-world implications for these experimental findings about trust? If trust beliefs drive trust behaviour, trust behaviour is important for economic success. Moreover, if some individuals hold persistently mistaken trust beliefs, then these mistaken beliefs may create substantial economic losses. 
The relationship between parentally instilled values and, ultimately, trust beliefs may be one source of persistently mistaken beliefs. A reduced-form channel may be false consensus. For instance, trustworthy individuals may believe that others are more trustworthy than they actually are – and, to the extent that false consensus operates on a subconscious level, its distorting effect on beliefs may not be eradicated by evidence. 
Consistent with either of these channels, in related research we document substantial economic losses at the individual level associated with mistaken trust beliefs in large-scale survey data (Butler et al. 2016b). The income losses we can attribute to mistaken trust beliefs are in the same order of magnitude as those associated with not going to college. We replicate this relationship between mistaken trust beliefs and earnings losses in an experimental trust game, where we also find a substantial role for parentally instilled values, and false consensus in shaping trust beliefs (Butler et al. 2015). 
Economists have singled out trust as an important phenomenon at the individual level, and for society as a whole. This raises natural questions about the determinants of trust. We knew already that decisions about whom and how much to trust are partly based on pecuniary considerations, but that there is a substantial and varied role for moral considerations. The interplay between trust, trust beliefs, instilled values, and automatic psychological process such as false consensus may be a particularly fruitful area for more research.

Texas insurer drops push to let homeowners forgo right to sue Texas Tribune. Margarita: 
Not many (probably) remember that the largely successful effort to gut tort laws around the country started in mid-80s by insurance companies, after they lost money in the early 1980s real estate boom/bust. Not satisfied with the current tepid tort laws, they are at it again. 
And Adam Levitin via e-mail: 
I love that the arbitration is getting priced. This is a great example of what I've tried to teach in contracts for years: the law only looks at the one-off contract. But the insurer doesn't give a shit about the individual contract. It's all actuarial tables. And that creates a total mismatch. The consumer is a one time player, while the insurer is a repeat player. The consumer will rationally value the arbitration clause at basically nothing (there's an optimism bias too–no one gets married thinking that they're going to get divorced), because the odds of it being important are so low and there's only one contract. But because the insurer is doing multiple contracts, even low odds matter. As a result consumers will never properly price for arbitration clauses and the like. 
Notice, btw, that the CFPB cannot stop this because it doesn't have authority over home insurance. That's all state level regulation.

And this is what Moody's has to say about Apple's wondrous cash hoard, much of it overseas: 
Based on Apple's reported results for its fiscal year that ended in September, Moody's projects the company's cash will exceed $250 billion by the end of calendar 2016, representing over 14% of total non-financial corporate cash. 
And then it dives straight into tax lobbying, in behalf of its clients, directed straight at Congress: 
'Without tax reform that reduces the negative financial consequences of repatriating money to the US, we expect offshore cash levels to continue increasing,' said Richard Lane, a Senior Vice President at Moody's. 
The financial media jumped on the bandwagon and quoted this falsehood for mass consumption in order to pressure Congress to give our multinational corporate heroes another opportunity to dodge taxes, on top of the countless opportunities already written into the tax code for them that small businesses don't have access to. 
But here's the thing. In May 2013, Apple got into a pickle because it had decided to fund its stock-buy-back and dividend program by taking on a record $17 billion in debt rather than 'repatriating' part of its 'offshore' cash and paying income taxes on it. 
The Senate subcommittee investigation and hearings, chaired by Senator John McCain , showed that Apple had sheltered at least $74 billion from US income taxes between 2009 and 2012 by using a 'complex web' of offshore mailbox companies. The investigation found untaxed 'offshore' profits of $102 billion held by Irish subsidiaries – which Apple refused to 'repatriate' in order to keep that income from being taxed in the US. 
But according to the Senate report, Apple doesn't have to repatriate that moolah because it's already in the US. The Irish mailbox subsidiaries, on whose books this money is for tax purposes, transferred it to Apple's bank accounts in New York. The money is managed by an Apple subsidiary in Reno, Nevada, and is invested in all kinds of assets in the US. Apple's accountants in Austin, Texas, keep the books, 
Money doesn't stop at borders. Tax accounting does. 
These revelations explained another corporate mystery that had long baffled economists. In 2004, after heavy lobbying by our Corporate Titans, Congress declared a 'repatriation holiday' to encourage the 'return' of $300 billion in overseas cash to be invested in the US. This would cause a burst of investment and hiring in the US, it was said. This was similar to what Moody's is now clamoring for on behalf of its clients, except this time, they want permanent tax reform rather than a one-time 'repatriation holiday.' 
So in 2004, our heroes made some adjustments on their books to 'repatriate' these profits that were then taxed at the special and minuscule rate of 5.25%, less than the payroll taxes withheld from their US working stiffs. 
And then nothing happened. There were no investments and no hiring and no benefits for the economy because the money had already been deployed in the US, as we now know. In May 2013, as a result of the Senate hearings, the New York Times summarized the 2004 phenomenon this way: 
On the contrary, some of the companies that brought back the most money laid off thousands of workers, and a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research later concluded that 92 cents on every dollar was used for dividends, stock buybacks or executive bonuses. 
This sort of 'repatriation holiday' or tax reform would simply be a handout benefitting our Corporate Titans, but not the millions of smaller companies that don't have the resources to lobby Congress, make special deals with foreign governments, and create that 'complex web' of offshore mailbox companies. They're too busy struggling on a daily basis in their dog-eat-dog world. 
Subcommittee Chairman John McCain thundered in his opening statement of the hearings that it was 'unacceptable that corporations like Apple are able to exploit tax loopholes to avoid paying billions in taxes.' Since then, nothing happened in Congress. The loophole wasn't closed. And the falsehoods that had been stabbed many times during the hearings have once again risen to shine in even greater glory, with Moody's adding some additional sparkle.

Dear patient readers, 
Lambert and I recognize that the caliber of reporting from both the MSM and independent news outlets has in many cases moved in a crazypants direction as Election Day nears. Unfortunately, the commentariat has taken far too much of this up, as in has featured links to dodgy stories and theories and has treated them with far more dignity than they warrant. 
We have shut down comments entirely when the quality has decayed too far or they have become too fractious. We hope not to have to do that, but in the last week alone, we've had to rip out two entire comment threads, something we are extremely loath to do. That sort of thing should happen at most once a year, not with anything approaching this frequency. 
This site has policy impact. We have spent far too many years building that to put it at risk. We lose credibility with some of the discussions that have been taking place recently. Please use better discernment as to whether the topic you'd like to chew over really belongs here, as opposed to Facebook or Zero Hedge.

The Colorado oil and gas industry is poised to strike a devastating blow against anti-fracking activists Tuesday. Enactment of Amendment 71 , a statewide ballot initiative campaign that's backed by the industry, will make it, in the words of the Denver Post' s editorial board, ' nearly impossible ' for Colorado voters to amend their state constitution to allow for local fracking bans — or, for that matter, anything else. 
It's a story worth telling in some detail, because it vividly illustrates the many obstacles well-connected and well-funded special interests can put in the way of citizens trying to oppose them. The latest battle in a multi-year campaign by a network of pro-fossil fuel groups to defend the fracking industry against local opponents, Amendment 71 would require 2 percent of registered voters in each of Colorado's 35 state Senate districts to sign petitions for any future initiative before it could be put on the ballot. Right now, anyone who wishes to amend the state constitution must collect signatures from 5 percent of the number of voters who voted for secretary of state in the last election. 
That threshold is still not always easy for grass-roots groups to meet: Two green priorities — an amendment allowing for local bans on fracking and an amendment requiring fracking operations to be at least a half mile from homes or schools — failed to make the cut for this year's ballot, according to the secretary of state. Disappointed environmentalists attribute that to a lack of time and resources, but also to a very well-financed campaign by the oil and gas industry. A report released by the watchdog group Public Citizen estimated that fossil fuel interests outspent anti-fracking activists by a factor of 24-to-1. 
Nonetheless, greens feel ballot measures are among the best options in their political toolbox in a state where well-heeled oil and gas interests have managed to convince both Democratic and Republican politicians that what's good for their industry is good for the state's economy. 
'The political system in Colorado is really aligned with the oil and gas industry,' said Suzanne Spiegel, an organizer with Frack Free Colorado. She described the state's Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, as 'incredibly supportive' of fossil fuel interests. A former oil and gas geologist, Hickenlooper touts the industry as crucial to the state economy. He once claimed to have joined Halliburton executives in drinking one of the company's fracking fluids to demonstrate its safety. The governor's office did not respond to a request for comment on this article. 
For groups like Spiegel's, ballot initiatives provide an alternative to a political system they see as in the pocket of the fracking industry. 'One of the great things about Colorado is that we currently have access to this channel of direct democracy,' Spiegel said. But, she added, a victory for Amendment 71 'would all but eliminate it.' 
Both liberal and conservative groups that rely on grass-roots organizing have united to oppose the measure. Oil and gas interests, meanwhile, have thrown in millions of dollars from their sophisticated political operations to make sure the amendment passes on Tuesday. 
Fossil Fuels' Grip on Colorado 
The origins of the current political fight date back 2012, when the top two Colorado oil and gas companies, Anadarko and Noble Energy, geared up to challenge local opposition to fracking. Four Colorado towns were moving to ban fracking or place a moratorium on it. Longmont, Colorado had already succeeded in becoming the first town to do so earlier that year. 
The fracking boom had hit the state several years before, and some Coloradans were alarmed by the speed at which wells seemed to be multiplying. According to the federal Energy Information Administration , natural gas production doubled in the state between 2001 and 2015, and oil production doubled between 2012 and 2014. With that came a flood of political donations from the oil and gas industry to state and local officials. 
By 2014, when environmentalists began collecting signatures for two anti-fracking amendments (neither of which ultimately made it onto the ballot), the industry was fully mobilized. In addition to offering two pro-fracking ballot measures of their own, oil and gas interests set up a series of benignly named advocacy groups. Among these were Protecting Colorado's Environment, Economy, and Energy Independence — often referred to as simply 'Protect Colorado' — and Coloradans for Responsible Energy Development (CRED). 
According to IRS filings (posted online here and here by Greenpeace), these two spent $27 million to promote the industry that year. A political strategist working with the groups, Mark Truax, attended a September 2015 meeting of the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC), where industry executives, lobbyists and regulators from around the US gather to discuss strategy. Truax outlined the political groups' efforts on behalf of the pro-fracking measures, including a sophisticated voter outreach organization, according to a transcript of the meeting published in Boulder Weekly and made from a recording obtained by Greenpeace researcher Jesse Coleman. 
On the recording, Truax touted the way the pro-oil and gas groups had targeted 3.9 million voters by demographic to win their sympathy toward fracking. He explained how the groups had built coalitions among businesses in the state and how the industry focused on electing pro-oil and gas city council members. 
Industry representatives also worked closely with the state regulator, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission . The group's director, Matt Lepore , was present at the IOGCC meeting where Truax discussed strategy, and emails obtained by Greenpeace's Coleman through a Freedom of Information Act request show that Lepore and other regulatory officials met with CRED as the group was developing one of its outreach campaigns. 
'As a public agency, we make ourselves available to any interested party that wants to learn more — or ask about specific issues — related to the COGCC's work,' said Todd Hartman, a spokesperson for the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, in a statement to BillMoyers.com. 'As you might expect, we'd push back very hard' on the idea that the agency coordinates on communications efforts with the industry, he said, adding that COGCC meets monthly with a coalition of environmental groups. 
Academic Dispute 
To succeed, the oil and gas industry had to maintain the status quo. And in 2014, they did: No new towns passed fracking bans, and, as part of a compromise with Hickenlooper, environmentalists agreed to end their campaign to put anti-fracking ballot measures on the statewide ballot. As part of the compromise, however, Hickenlooper convened a task force to study ways in which Coloradans could have more input on fracking in their communities. Initially, fracking opponents were hopeful. 'The governor's announcement of the Oil and Gas Task Force is the first step forward in solving the problem of fracking occurring anywhere and everywhere,' said Rep. Jared Polis , a Democrat whose congressional district includes Boulder. 
But oil and gas interests already had been at work, commissioning researchers at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder to work on a series of studies that supported industry talking points. One study, underwritten by an industry-funded group called the Common Sense Policy Roundtable , along with two other groups not affiliated with the industry, declared that a moratorium on fracking would hurt the state's economy. Another, commissioned and funded by the American Petroleum Institute , demonstrated that fracking had a positive economic impact on Colorado communities. 
The reports got coverage in The Denver Post and The Colorado Springs Gazette , neither of which disclosed that the Common Sense Policy Roundtable was an industry group. When the relationship between the Leeds School researchers and the industry groups came to light, Bronson Hilliard, a spokesperson for the school at the time, told High Country News that the researchers didn't know about the group's funding. 'CU-Boulder policy researchers are under no obligation to understand industry organizations' financial ties or to report them,' he wrote in a statement . 
But emails between researchers and industry employees, obtained by Greenpeace and Boulder Weekly , appear to show that the industry weighed in as the study was being written, requesting revisions. 'I hope this new version is in line with what you envisioned… We look forward to further feedback and comments,' one CU-Boulder researcher said in an email sharing his findings with an API adviser. The emails also suggest a hope that the research would play a role in influencing the governor's task force. The task force's legislative recommendations ultimately did little for activists who were seeking greater control of fracking in their own communities. 
The End of Local Control 
Though the ballot measures that anti-fracking activists championed in 2014 and the governor's subsequent task force ultimately failed, towns were having some success banning fracking. By 2015, five Colorado communities as well as Boulder County had voted to implement local bans or moratoria on drilling. These sorts of bans represent a rare area of agreement between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton: Both have spoken in favor of 'local control' — the idea that communities should be able to decide whether or not to approve fracking. 
'I'm in favor of fracking, but I think that voters should have a big say in it,' Trump told Denver television station KUSA . 'I mean, there's some areas, maybe, they don't want to have fracking. And I think if the voters are voting for it, that's up to them.' Clinton has made similar statements, and that panicked oil and gas lobbyists , because the idea of local control has been so potent. In addition to the Colorado communities, New York and Maryland have both banned fracking, as have five counties in California. 
But the Colorado communities' bans were overturned this May when the state's Supreme Court ruled that Colorado law does not allow for 'local control.' 
So this year, anti-fracking activists wanted to put a new cause on the ballot: A 'local control' amendment to the state constitution that would allow towns to ban fracking. National groups such as 350.org, Food and Water Watch and Greenpeace lined up behind local groups' efforts to put the measure on the ballot, along with one that would have required fracking operations to be roughly half a mile from homes. 
Ultimately, however, Secretary of State Wayne Williams , a Republican, ruled that activists did not gather enough signatures to put these measures on the ballot. Activists handed in about 107,000 signatures — more than the 98,492 required. But Williams did not believe there were enough legitimate signatures to clear the bar. Advocates for the amendments decided they didn't have the resources to challenge that decision. 
The industry had prepared for a long and hard fight, but by September, it was all over. So Noble Energy and Anadarko decided instead to pour their money into another initiative — one that would likely make it so they wouldn't be fighting new activist ballot initiatives every year going forward. 
'Raise the Bar' 
Amendment 71 first surfaced as a campaign by business leaders and politicians called 'Raise the Bar.' But the idea had its genesis at least a year ago. Greenpeace's tapes of the September 2015 IOGCC meeting reveal a discussion about an initiative to change 'the actual ballot process itself.' Mark Truax, the political strategist working with the oil- and gas-backed industry groups CRED and Protect Colorado, told the meeting participants, 'We are in the process of evaluating that right now.' 
Coloradans have long complained their ballot is cluttered with proposed amendments and referenda that the average citizen cannot be expected to know anything about. The number of measures on the Colorado ballot is often quite large, creating a genuine frustration among voters. 
'This is too much,' Seth Masket, a University of Denver political science professor and commentator, wrote in Pacific Standard last month , describing his four-page ballot that included 15 state and local initiatives. 'There are some legitimately interesting ones, including an increase in the minimum wage, the creation of a new public health care system, and switching from a closed caucus to an open primary in presidential nominations. But is the ballot really the right place to hammer these things out? Do I and other Colorado voters have the necessary expertise to decide whether a substantial restructure of our public-health system will be in the state's best interests?' 
To bolster its argument for Amendment 71, Protect Colorado, one of the industry groups, has noted that most signatures on the recent anti-fracking ballot initiatives did not come from the regions where fracking is most intense, and argued that more communities should be involved in deciding what goes on the ballot. 
But the big money behind the initiative is raising alarms beyond the environmental community. The Denver Post editorial board — a body that often writes in support of the oil and gas industry — recently published an editorial opposing Amendment 71 for that very reason. 'The campaign and the cause are the antithesis of grass roots,' The Post wrote. 'The real muscle behind Raise the Bar is coming from the oil and gas industry.' 
'They have a really good shot of winning this thing, honestly,' said Frack Free Colorado's Spiegel. 'Their marketing is great around it. ‘Don't make it so easy to change the constitution' — people will get behind that if they don't know where it's coming from or why.' 
Activists are already planning to run another ballot measure campaign to try and legalize fracking bans in 2018. 'But if 71 gets adopted,' said Spiegel, 'our job is going to be really hard.' 0 0 0 0 0 0

Once upon a time, when choosing a new president, a factor for many voters was the perennial question: 'Whose finger do you want on the nuclear button?' Of all the responsibilities of America's top executive, none may be more momentous than deciding whether, and under what circumstances, to activate the 'nuclear codes'— the secret alphanumeric messages that would inform missile officers in silos and submarines that the fearful moment had finally arrived to launch their intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) toward a foreign adversary, igniting a thermonuclear war. 
Until recently in the post-Cold War world, however, nuclear weapons seemed to drop from sight, and that question along with it. Not any longer. In 2016, the nuclear issue is back big time, thanks both to the rise of Donald Trump ( including various unsettling comments he's made about nuclear weapons) and actual changes in the global nuclear landscape. 
With passions running high on both sides in this year's election and rising fears about Donald Trump's impulsive nature and Hillary Clinton's hawkish one, it's hardly surprising that the 'nuclear button' question has surfaced repeatedly throughout the campaign. In one of the more pointed exchanges of the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton declared that Donald Trump lacked the mental composure for the job. 'A man who can be provoked by a tweet,' she commented , 'should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes.' Donald Trump has reciprocated by charging that Clinton is too prone to intervene abroad. 'You're going to end up in World War III over Syria,' he told reporters in Florida last month. 
For most election observers, however, the matter of personal character and temperament has dominated discussions of the nuclear issue, with partisans on each side insisting that the other candidate is temperamentally unfit to exercise control over the nuclear codes. There is, however, a more important reason to worry about whose finger will be on that button this time around: at this very moment, for a variety of reasons, the 'nuclear threshold'— the point at which some party to a 'conventional' (non-nuclear) conflict chooses to employ atomic weapons — seems to be moving dangerously lower. 
Not so long ago, it was implausible that a major nuclear power — the United States, Russia, or China — would consider using atomic weapons in any imaginable conflict scenario. No longer. Worse yet, this is likely to be our reality for years to come, which means that the next president will face a world in which a nuclear decision-making point might arrive far sooner than anyone would have thought possible just a year or two ago — with potentially catastrophic consequences for us all. 
No less worrisome, the major nuclear powers (and some smaller ones) are all in the process of acquiring new nuclear arms, which could, in theory, push that threshold lower still. These include a variety of cruise missiles and other delivery systems capable of being used in 'limited' nuclear wars — atomic conflicts that, in theory at least, could be confined to just a single country or one area of the world (say, Eastern Europe) and so might be even easier for decision-makers to initiate. The next president will have to decide whether the U.S. should actually produce weapons of this type and also what measures should be taken in response to similar decisions by Washington's likely adversaries. 
Lowering the Nuclear Threshold 
During the dark days of the Cold War, nuclear strategists in the United States and the Soviet Union conjured up elaborate conflict scenarios in which military actions by the two superpowers and their allies might lead from, say, minor skirmishing along the Iron Curtain to full-scale tank combat to, in the end, the use of 'battlefield' nuclear weapons, and then city-busting versions of the same to avert defeat. In some of these scenarios, strategists hypothesized about wielding 'tactical' or battlefield weaponry — nukes powerful enough to wipe out a major tank formation, but not Paris or Moscow — and claimed that it would be possible to contain atomic warfare at such a devastating but still sub-apocalyptic level. (Henry Kissinger, for instance, made his reputation by preaching this lunatic doctrine in his first book, Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy .) Eventually, leaders on both sides concluded that the only feasible role for their atomic arsenals was to act as deterrents to the use of such weaponry by the other side. This was, of course, the concept of ' mutually assured destruction ,' or — in one of the most classically apt acronyms of all times: MAD. It would, in the end, form the basis for all subsequent arms control agreements between the two superpowers. 
Anxiety over the escalatory potential of tactical nuclear weapons peaked in the 1970s when the Soviet Union began deploying the SS-20 intermediate-range ballistic missile (capable of striking cities in Europe, but not the U.S.) and Washington responded with plans to deploy nuclear-armed, ground-launched cruise missiles and the Pershing-II ballistic missile in Europe. The announcement of such plans provoked massive antinuclear demonstrations across Europe and the United States. On December 8, 1987, at a time when worries had been growing about how a nuclear conflagration in Europe might trigger an all-out nuclear exchange between the superpowers, President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. 
That historic agreement — the first to eliminate an entire class of nuclear delivery systems — banned the deployment of ground-based cruise or ballistic missiles with a range of 500 and 5,500 kilometers and required the destruction of all those then in existence. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation inherited the USSR's treaty obligations and pledged to uphold the INF along with other U.S.-Soviet arms control agreements. In the view of most observers, the prospect of a nuclear war between the two countries practically vanished as both sides made deep cuts in their atomic stockpiles in accordance with already existing accords and then signed others, including the New START , the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty of 2010. 
Today, however, this picture has changed dramatically. The Obama administration has concluded that Russia has violated the INF treaty by testing a ground-launched cruise missile of prohibited range, and there is reason to believe that, in the not-too-distant future, Moscow might abandon that treaty altogether. Even more troubling, Russia has adopted a military doctrine that favors the early use of nuclear weapons if it faces defeat in a conventional war, and NATO is considering comparable measures in response. The nuclear threshold, in other words, is dropping rapidly. 
Much of this is due, it seems, to Russian fears about its military inferiority vis-à-vis the West. In the chaotic years following the collapse of the USSR, Russian military spending plummeted and the size and quality of its forces diminished accordingly. In an effort to restore Russia's combat capabilities, President Vladimir Putin launched a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar expansion and modernization program. The fruits of this effort were apparent in the Crimea and Ukraine in 2014, when Russian forces, however disguised, demonstrated better fighting skills and wielded better weaponry than in the Chechnya wars a decade earlier. Even Russian analysts acknowledge, however, that their military in its current state would be no match for American and NATO forces in a head-on encounter, given the West's superior array of conventional weaponry. To fill the breach, Russian strategic doctrine now calls for the early use of nuclear weapons to offset an enemy's superior conventional forces. 
To put this in perspective, Russian leaders ardently believe that they are the victims of a U.S.-led drive by NATO to encircle their country and diminish its international influence. They point, in particular, to the build-up of NATO forces in the Baltic countries, involving the semi-permanent deployment of combat battalions in what was once the territory of the Soviet Union, and in apparent violation of promises made to Gorbachev in 1990 that NATO would not do so. As a result, Russia has been bolstering its defenses in areas bordering Ukraine and the Baltic states, and training its troops for a possible clash with the NATO forces stationed there. 
This is where the nuclear threshold enters the picture. Fearing that it might be defeated in a future clash, its military strategists have called for the early use of tactical nuclear weapons, some of which no doubt would violate the INF Treaty, in order to decimate NATO forces and compel them to quit fighting. Paradoxically, in Russia, this is labeled a ' de-escalation ' strategy, as resorting to strategic nuclear attacks on the U.S. under such circumstances would inevitably result in Russia's annihilation. On the other hand, a limited nuclear strike (so the reasoning goes) could potentially achieve success on the battlefield without igniting all-out atomic war. As Eugene Rumer of the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace explains, this strategy assumes that such supposedly 'limited' nuclear strikes 'will have a sobering effect on the enemy, which will then cease and desist.' 
To what degree tactical nuclear weapons have been incorporated into Moscow's official military doctrine remains unknown, given the degree of secrecy surrounding such matters. It is apparent, however, that the Russians have been developing the means with which to conduct such 'limited' strikes. Of greatest concern to Western analysts in this regard is their deployment of the Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile, a modern version of the infamous Soviet-era 'Scud' missile (used by Saddam Hussein's forces during the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-1988 and the Persian Gulf War of 1990-1991). Said to have a range of 500 kilometers (just within the INF limit), the Iskander can carry either a conventional or a nuclear warhead. As a result, a targeted country or a targeted military could never be sure which type it might be facing (and might simply assume the worst). Adding to such worries, the Russians have deployed the Iskander in Kaliningrad, a tiny chunk of Russian territory wedged between Poland and Lithuania that just happens to put it within range of many western European cities. 
In response, NATO strategists have discussed lowering the nuclear threshold themselves, arguing — ominously enough — that the Russians will only be fully dissuaded from employing their limited-nuclear-war strategy if they know that NATO has a robust capacity to do the same. At the very least, what's needed, some of them claim , is a more frequent inclusion of nuclear-capable or dual-use aircraft in exercises on Russia's frontiers to 'signal' NATO's willingness to resort to limited nuclear strikes, too. Again, such moves are not yet official NATO strategy, but it's clear that senior officials are weighing them seriously. 
Just how all of this might play out in a European crisis is, of course, unknown, but both sides in an increasingly edgy standoff are coming to accept that nuclear weapons might have a future military role, which is, of course, a recipe for almost unimaginable escalation and disaster of an apocalyptic sort. This danger is likely to become more pronounced in the years ahead because both Washington and Moscow seem remarkably intent on developing and deploying new nuclear weapons designed with just such needs in mind. 
The New Nuclear Armaments 
Both countries are already in the midst of ambitious and extremely costly efforts to ' modernize ' their nuclear arsenals. Of all the weapons now being developed, the two generating the most anxiety in terms of that nuclear threshold are a new Russian ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) and an advanced U.S. air-launched cruise missile (ALCM). Unlike ballistic missiles, which exit the Earth's atmosphere before returning to strike their targets, such cruise missiles remain within the atmosphere throughout their flight. 
American officials claim that the Russian GLCM, reportedly now being deployed, is of a type outlawed by the INF Treaty. Without providing specifics, the State Department indicated in a 2014 memo that it had 'a range capability of 500 km [kilometers] to 5,500 km,' which would indeed put it in violation of that treaty by allowing Russian combat forces to launch nuclear warheads against cities throughout Europe and the Middle East in a 'limited' nuclear war. 
The GLCM is likely to prove one of the most vexing foreign policy issues the next president will face. So far, the White House has been reluctant to press Moscow too hard, fearing that the Russians might respond by exiting the INF Treaty altogether and so eliminate remaining constraints on its missile program. But many in Congress and among Washington's foreign policy elite are eager to see the next occupant of the Oval Office take a tougher stance if the Russians don't halt deployment of the missile, threatening Moscow with more severe economic sanctions or moving toward countermeasures like the deployment of enhanced anti-missile systems in Europe. The Russians would, in turn, undoubtedly perceive such moves as threats to their strategic deterrent forces and so an invitation for further weapons acquisitions, setting off a fresh round in the long-dormant Cold War nuclear arms race. 
On the American side, the weapon of immediate concern is a new version of the AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile, usually carried by B-52 bombers. Also known as the Long-Range Standoff Weapon (LRSO), it is, like the Iskander-M, expected to be deployed in both nuclear and conventional versions, leaving those on the potential receiving end unsure what might be heading their way. In other words, as with the Iskander-M, the intended target might assume the worst in a crisis, leading to the early use of nuclear weapons. Put another way, such missiles make for twitchy trigger fingers and are likely to lead to a heightened risk of nuclear war, which, once started, might in turn take Washington and Moscow right up the escalatory ladder to a planetary holocaust. 
No wonder former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry called on President Obama to cancel the ALCM program in a recent Washington Post op-ed piece. 'Because they… come in both nuclear and conventional variants,' he wrote, 'cruise missiles are a uniquely destabilizing type of weapon.' And this issue is going to fall directly into the lap of the next president. 
The New Nuclear Era 
Whoever is elected on November 8th, we are evidently all headed into a world in which Trumpian-style itchy trigger fingers could be the norm. It already looks like both Moscow and Washington will contribute significantly to this development — and they may not be alone. In response to Russian and American moves in the nuclear arena, China is reported to be developing a ' hypersonic glide vehicle ,' a new type of nuclear warhead better able to evade anti-missile defenses — something that, at a moment of heightened crisis, might make a nuclear first strike seem more attractive to Washington. And don't forget Pakistan, which is developing its own short-range 'tactical' nuclear missiles, increasing the risk of the quick escalation of any future Indo-Pakistani confrontation to a nuclear exchange. (To put such 'regional' dangers in perspective, a local nuclear war in South Asia could cause a global nuclear winter and, according to one study , possibly kill a billion people worldwide, thanks to crop failures and the like.) 
And don't forget North Korea, which is now testing a nuclear-armed ICBM, the Musudan, intended to strike the Western United States. That prompted a controversial decision in Washington to deploy THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) anti-missile batteries in South Korea (something China bitterly opposes), as well as the consideration of other countermeasures, including undoubtedly scenarios involving first strikes against the North Koreans. 
It's clear that we're on the threshold of a new nuclear era: a time when the actual use of atomic weapons is being accorded greater plausibility by military and political leaders globally, while war plans are being revised to allow the use of such weapons at an earlier stage in future armed clashes. 
As a result, the next president will have to grapple with nuclear weapons issues — and possible nuclear crises — in a way unknown since the Cold War era. Above all else, this will require both a cool head and a sufficient command of nuclear matters to navigate competing pressures from allies, the military, politicians, pundits, and the foreign policy establishment without precipitating a nuclear conflagration. On the face of it, that should disqualify Donald Trump. When questioned on nuclear issues in the first debate, he exhibited a striking ignorance of the most basic aspects of nuclear policy. But even Hillary Clinton, for all her experience as secretary of state, is likely to have a hard time grappling with the pressures and dangers that are likely to arise in the years ahead, especially given that her inclination is to toughen U.S. policy toward Russia. 
In other words, whoever enters the Oval Office, it may be time for the rest of us to take up those antinuclear signs long left to molder in closets and memories, and put some political pressure on leaders globally to avoid strategies and weapons that would make human life on this planet so much more precarious than it already is. 0 0 0 0 0 0

Jerri-Lynn here: There are many reasons to despair at the choice US voters face in tomorrow's election. The danger that either candidate will goad Russia or China, without respect to consequences, is perhaps the most immediate and frightening. While many media hounds chase the false scent of alleged Russian manipulation of Trump, the election, and Wikileaks, to name just a few of the crazy allegations being discussed, this more serious threat has not been pursued nearly as vigorously. 
In this Real News Network interview , journalist John Pilger and TRNN's Paul Jay discuss why the very real prospect of another World War is not taken seriously by the US media. Pilger argues that whoever is elected, tensions with China and Russia will escalate. I tidied up the rush transcript as best I could. Please excuse any remaining errors. 
PAUL JAY, TRNN: Welcome to the Real News Network. I'm Paul Jay. 
In a few days, Americans are going to decide who the next President of the United States is going to be. Of course, this is an issue of global concern, given that the United States considers itself hegemon of the world and acts that way. What will be the difference perhaps is the foreign policy of the next President, whatever it is, Clinton or Trump. Based on what we've seen the last few years and how does one assess all of this? I think we're assessing the degree of danger to the world. There doesn't seem to be any other measurement here. 
Now joining us to discuss all of this is John Pilger. John joins us from London. John is an award- winning very celebrated filmmaker and journalist. His films have been broadcast on major broadcast platforms and channels around the world. His latest film is The Coming War on China , which will be released in December. Thanks very much for joining us John. 
JOHN PILGER: You're welcome. 
JAY: So as I said in the opening, it's a kind of a question of who is more dangerous. There doesn't seem to be any question. I think in most thinking peoples minds that one way or the other, US foreign policy is going to be dangerous for people of the world, particularly in the Middle East but not only. What is your assessment in this moment? 
PILGER: Well it's always dangerous. I sometimes think that it's extraordinary I've gotten to this stage in life and I haven't been blown up by US foreign policy. But so we all of us outside the US quake before a US election. That said, the US isn't run by presidents, it's run by a vast national security machine and that hasn't changed in the last 15 years or so. I think the other 2 candidates. One is clearly a rogue candidate and that's Donald Trump and the other, Hillary Clinton, is the candidate of this vast national security machine. 
I think what's been a pity for all of us outside the United States and indeed for all Americans, is that the hysteria over Donald Trump has obscured the fact that Hillary Clinton may well turn out to be one of the more dangerous presidents, assuming she does win as the polls suggest, though she may not of course. Because she is the president. She is almost the embodiment of a status quo that since 9/11 has left us all in a very precarious state. It's left the Middle East in a precarious state. But above all, it's brought us to the brink of some kind of very serious confrontation with Russia and the taunting of Russia, the intimidation of Russia is now unabated and just over the horizon there is a similar baiting of the other great nuclear power, China. 
Now this issue which of course amounts to the prospect of another world war, even another nuclear war, have not been touched on. 
Well they have been touched on. Ironically in the first debate, Donald Trump was asked about this and he said words to the effect, words that I would not go nuclear. I would not do a first strike. This wasn't used. It wasn't published. Now I would've thought for whatever it's worth, he might not have meant it. Trump says a lot of things he doesn't mean. Contradicts himself. But I would've thought that difference between Trump and Clinton on the issue of nuclear war, of war and peace was pretty critical. At least an issue to be debated. But it wasn't. 
JAY: Yeah, the American media is totally involved in this salacious part of Trump's history and as usual, not very interested in any issues of polices of substance. You can find things on both of these candidates that would give one the chills. Starting with Trump, the great danger of Trump is that it won't be President Trump, it will be President Pence. Pence has been asked who he's going to model his Vice Presidency after and he says Cheney and in terms of foreign policy outlook, there seems to be no difference between him and Cheney. 
PILGER: Well, what's the difference between any of them frankly? I mean neocon is a terrible word but it describes them all. Trump is perhaps more interesting because he seems to have upset all the establishment. The CIA wants him beaten, the Pentagon wants him beaten, the State Department wants him beaten, even his own party wants him beaten. I mean something recommends him and just his enemies do. So, whether there is a difference I think there's a difference of that much. I do emphasize this, that as you mentioned all these salacious stories about Trump but you know what do people want? Do they want to hear salacious stories or do they want to hear about the prospects of war and peace? Do they want to hear about whether we're entering an extremely dangerous period in relation to Russia or not? 
These issues have not been addressed and I don't think theres any doubt that Clinton who has very unusually named a cabinet already in a sense and a very good article by one of the independent journalists in Washington, Gareth Porter, listed these people and they're all war hawks. And she said it in the last debate. Im going to have a no-fly zone in Syria. That means attacking Russian planes. 
JAY: I think there's no doubt whichever of these people get elected president, in spite of Trump's rhetoric and if you look at what Pence says, I think both Clinton and I will say a Pence Trump, and I put Pence first because I think that's the more likely scenario, are going to be looking for provocations with Russia. Both Clinton and Pence are using Russian rhetoric to try and engage but using more than rhetoric. There's this very interesting WikiLeaks that I don't think has received nearly enough attention which shows something about the State Department under Clinton's mentality. 
It said in the WikiLeaks that it's not said who it's to or from but when I asked some of the people we know who have some expertise in this, they say it sounds like a State Department briefing. It says to get the Israelis in support or not in active opposition to the Iran deal we need to get rid of Assad. And essentially– and one assumes the reason for getting that will please Israel is to undermine Hezbollah– but it kind of shows what drives a lot of State Department thinking and I don't think it's a big stretch to think it drives Clinton thinking. 
PILGER: Yeah, well, she hasn't hidden it. She's had an obsequious relationship with Israel– it's well known. Her tough talking, her militarist talking, is all out there in the open. She's made it clear that she's going to face off Vladimir Putin. She's going to talk tough to the Chinese. As a kind of insanity about all this. I mean US foreign policy is actually run in a straight line since 1945. But it's become more extreme in the last 10-15 years. That's what worries most of us outside the United States and ought to worry those of you in the United States that it's become so extreme now. So extreme that the prospect of an accidental war at the very least. Here we are at centenaries of the first world war where all the lessons of there are glaring out at us of not quite accidental war. Intended war that lit up and became a slaughter partly by accident. I don't for a moment think that this verbose provocateur who is currently the Defense Secretary, Mr. Carter, who is forever shouting his militarist slogans around the world. I don't for a moment think that he actually wants nuclear war. But he sure is trying to bring it on. I've never known anything quite like his constant aggression. And this campaign of sending out these admirals and generals. Like Admiral Harry Harris in the Pacific speaking like Lord Palmerston in the 19th century. You know how much he runs from the world. You know what you say from Bollywood to Hollywood. You know these rather absurd people but with very great power. 
JAY: The overall agenda of American dominance I don't think changes much between the various administrations or parties. But do you not think sometimes individual and specific agendas within the complexity of the America elites plays a role? I'll give you a couple examples. First of all, Cheney clearly drove the Iraq war. John Kiriakou, the former CIA agent said there was a morning meeting with the heads of all the major agencies and top Pentagon officials in the year leading up to the Iraq War and that that completely quite out of the ordinary, that morning phone call was chaired by Dick Cheney. And that in that phone call, and Kiriakou was apparently on it sometimes with some of the CIA people, most of the heads of agencies, most of the officialdom of the military complex were against invading Iraq. Cheney actually threatened these people saying resign or do what you're ordered to. 
There are times when specific agendas can take hold. Like for example the people I guess that what the Real News, they heard us talk about Project for New American Century often enough. The very far right type of agenda. The other one where I think it did make a difference is if you look at the Obama-McCain election. This is not to say Obama has not been aggressive and has not committed war crimes because he has. On the other hand, this is John Bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb Iran McCain and Obama does make a deal with Iran. I mean there are differences within these corridors of power which are sometimes important are there not? 
PILGER: Obama decided not to attack Iran. I don't know about making a deal with Iran. They decided not to attack Iran. Attacking Iran would've been a disaster of course for the people of Iran and in the Middle East. But it would've also been a disaster for the United States. 
JAY: As the Iraq War was. 
PILGER: He decided not to attack them. So yes, but Obama has run probably more wars simultaneously than any other president. He's run probably the most comprehensive terror campaign in his drone warfare of assassination. You know we can sit here and say that one is slightly better. 
JAY: I wouldn't even use the word better. I would say in specific circumstances. 
PILGER: I was searching. I was going to say less insane than the other. Sure. But in the end, here we are in 2016 in a presidential campaign and I've covered 4 US presidential campaigns and I thought no you couldn't have Nixon as president. Well looking back on Nixon compared with some of the others who have come since, maybe a little less insane there. I don't know. But here we are in 2016 with this political freak show in the United States that spells great danger for all of us. 
JAY: John talk a little bit about the film you're working on and why you think there's such a looming confrontation with China, what's driving it? 
PILGER: Well it's not what I think. The evidence is very clear. I mean Obama, the one who's done the deals, hes announced that he went to Australia in 2011 and announced what was known as the pivot to Asia and that was the deployment, the transfer of almost two-thirds of US naval forces into the Asia Pacific region by the year 2020. And at the moment there are 400 US bases ringing China. They start in Australia and they go all the way through Asia, up through the Pacific, Korea, Japan, across Eurasia, Afghanistan, India. If you look at them on a map, you can understand why the Chinese have apparently changed their nuclear policy to a first strike policy. They never had that. They used to keep the missiles and warheads separate. They don't anymore. 
In the informed literature, the Journal of Concerned Scientists and there have been a number of articles that have described in some detail how the Chinese have changed their nuclear profile. They're worried. I was there not long ago and I spoke to a number of strategists and people are worried– rather confused actually– but worried and some of them are quite angry. The whole building of air strips on the Spratly and Paracel Islands in the South China Sea was a defensive move. Last year the United States conducted possibly the biggest naval exercise in history. Talisman Saber in which it rehearsed a blockade across the Malacca Straits through which comes 80% of China's oil and its raw materials. 
The Chinese understand all of this. They know all of this. If it's not explained to us through our media, they certainly know about it. This kind of provocation against China has been almost, I wouldn't say a sideshow but it's another chapter. The first chapter of course is the provocation of Russia. And that is probably the most dangerous. Does anyone in the United States know what the Russians are thinking? What people in Russia are thinking? That they're having civil drill exercises. What the Russian press is saying? What people think about this? 
There is a sense in much of Russia that the United States is about to attack them. This is very, very dangerous because it puts a country in a defensive position, and that's when accidents can happen. There is no debate about this in what is it? Constitutionally the free-est place in the world, in the United States? Nothing. Read the New York Times for the last couple of days. It's become a sort of Cold War propaganda sheet. Stories that are clearly nonsense. 
JAY: The objective seems to be one would think to weaken Putin but if anything's going to strengthen Putin it's this kind of threat that creates an increased amount of nationalism and such. 
PILGER: Well I don't know if it will strengthen Putin at all. I don't know enough about Russia. But the little I do know suggests that Putin is one of those who is always talking about being a partner of the United States. He does want to be a partner. He sees Russia's future in Europe. There are others in Russia who have had enough of the talk of partnership and who drink in a deep well of Russian nationalism and Russian memory of all their great invasions of their country. So, I don't know whether it strengthens Putin or not. Perhaps it doesn't. Whatever it is, it's dangerous. 
JAY: You mean in other ways it could be strengthening far more nationalists and fascistic forces that could actually- 
PILGER: Well not fascistic. In fact, there are plenty of fascists in Ukraine. You wouldn't know that reading the US press. There was a coup in 2014. Fascist led. Paid for by the United States. The truth of that is inverted and it has Russia invading Ukraine. I mean couldn't make it up but that's the received wisdom. Now I'm not sure about the fascistic elements in Russia but there could be militarist elements and there could be those in the very powerful national security sector in Russia that say we have to prepare and they are preparing of course. Their weapons industry has been developing in a very sophisticated way in the last few years. Their air defenses and so on. But this is all war preparation. You know whether it's Clinton or Trump it's deeply worrying and deeply disturbing when reckless politicians like Hillary Clinton can stand up and beat every war drum that is put in front of them. That's reckless. 
JAY: Alright thanks very much for joining us, John. 
PILGER: You're welcome. 
JAY: And thank you for joining us on the Real News Network. 0 0 0 0 0 0

ARTICLE

by Yves Smith 
The law firm Akin Gump issued a warning that might chill the bones of some private equity general partners: clawbacks may be a-comin'. From the firm's website : 
In recent months, managers of private equity funds in the energy sector have been facing a scenario they likely never imagined: having to return millions of dollars of their 'carried interest' earnings back to investors. 
For newbies to this private equity practice, private equity funds typically pay the profit share, prototypically 20% once a target rate of return has been met. What creates the possibility of a clawback is the fact that for most US funds, the profit computation and any payouts are made every time a portfolio company is sold. By contrast, in 'European' deals, the carry fees are paid only at the end of the fund's life. 
The conventional US approach, combined with strong general partner incentives to realize profits on at least some promising deals early in the fund's life, means that the general partners can pay themselves carry fees that are more than they deserved once the impact of doggy companies, which are sold late in the fund's life, are factored in. Hence the limited partnership agreements provide for 'clawbacks,' as in the recovery of overpayments of carry fees. 
Yet as we've written, clawbacks are almost never paid in practice. Why? First, the clawback provisions have tax language that is very favorable to the general partners, and has the economic effect that they can hang on what are excessive carry fees based on raw cash flows. Second, possession is 9/10ths of the law. In those instances where the general partner owes limited partner clawbacks, the general partner usually goes to the limited partners and offers them a special deal (details often unspecified!) on their next fund. Needless to say, this approach has the desirable effect of pre-committing those limited partners. 
Akin Gump flagged specifically the lousy performance of some unnamed energy funds. In light of the discussion above, the limited partners have been sufficiently burned that they have no intention of investing in energy funds any time soon, and may also be willing to be atypically forceful about getting money back. Recall that limited partners fetishize maintaining friction-free relationships with general partners. Again from the firm's missive: 
Several energy-related funds that were formed in nascent stages of the boom now have terms ending during collapse-protracted downturns. Managers may feel as though they could recoup some losses if they could delay liquidating assets until oil recovers further. Many fund agreements provide for a one or two year extension of the fund's investment period at the manager's discretion; however, to the extent that this option has already been exhausted, some managers are now going back to investors to seek additional time and, potentially, additional capital. To placate investors in such cases, a manager may need to reduce or eliminate management fees charged to a fund for the duration of any extension period. Unfortunately, apart from extending a fund's investment or harvest period, managers have little recourse after a fund's inception. 
In other words, Mr. Market did not bail these funds out and a day of reckoning is coming. 
Interestingly, Akins Gump uses pain in the oil patch to argue that general partners should consider building in better means for assuring that general partners can pay clawbacks back if they are due and owing. What this document reveals is that limited partners have signed up for clawback agreements that are likely to be empty in practice. The money went years ago into the firm's carry pool, and hence for payouts to senior and mid-level staffers. The top dogs may have tied the money up in investments or property (houses, art) that they can't readily liquidate. Or the funds may be beyond their reach entirely by having gone to outlays (political fundraising or a campaign, big gifts to charities) or an ex-wife. People below the senior level may have moved on. And perhaps as important, all the true partners (owners of the management company) have vis-a-vis everyone else who is in the firm is moral suasion. How far do you think that is going to go in getting people to write checks to disgorge monies they banked or worse spent, years ago? 
What is striking about the Akins Gump article is that the firm is giving what amounts to marketing rather than legal advice: 
The best way a manager can avoid the predicament of having to return a large sum to investors in respect of a clawback is to build preventative measures into the organizational documents of the fund or the vehicle earning the carry at the outset (i.e., escrows at the carry level or the contractual ability to get any distributions back from employees). 
Mind you, the private equity business has been around for 40 years, and has had large and supposedly savvy institutional investors for 30 plus years. The general partners have always been expose to the risk of paying clawbacks when their limited partnership agreements allow for them. So what is different now? 
Perhaps it is that investors are more acutely aware of the risk of investing at the peak of cycle than in the past, and the example of what happened to energy funds has made them realize that they could see problems like that on a broader basis. Moreover, given that the mainstream media is much less reverential in its treatment of private equity than in the past, if a meaningful minority of funds were to post overall crappy returns, resulting in meaningful clawbacks due, the press is more likely to expose the failure of investors like public pension funds to get insistent about getting their money back. Limited partner suing general partners is unheard of, but in a weak returns environment, private equity would no longer be a 'must have' portfolio allocation. So Akins Gump appears to be alerting the industry to a risk that they had been able to cavalierly ignore that may start to bite them. 
And another reason for concern: 
Further, although Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to executive compensation could impose a mandatory return-of-incentive compensation scheme on certain financial institutions, it is unlikely that the proposed rules, in their current formulation, would apply to carried interest distributions, but they are subject to further clarification. 
The suggestions acknowledge that money-driven private equity professionals wouldn't be happy with a 'wait until the dust has settled' European structure. Some of the ideas include escrowing some carry but not so much as to demotivate staffers (30% was the suggested level), interim clawbacks that require the general partner 'to reckon with any shortcomings as they occur.' A modified deal-by-deal structure would require the general partner to tally up losses and writedowns and earn back the shortfall before any more carry could be paid. 
Akins Gump curiously omitted another option: a performance bond. It's not hard to imagine that Wall Street firms would be willing to insure this risk (or at least after the general partners paid a first loss amount) for a suitable fee. 
Nevertheless, this alert to general partners, as occurs so routinely in private equity, illustrates how remiss the limited partners have been. It would be gratifying if the underlying assumption in the Akins Gump piece were correct, that the deterioration in private equity profit generation is leading to contract terms becoming less one-sided in favor of general partners. But given the degree of complacency among limited, don't expect these changes to take place any time soon. 0 0 0 0 0 0

ARTICLE

by Outis Philalithopoulos In the most recent episode of this series , the ghost of Outis had fun watching a Disney movie. Afterwards, he spoke with Zootopia 's star, Judy Hopps, about the movie's sly humor, and its efficacy at stigmatizing prejudice and fostering empathy for the suffering of others. After my visit from Judy, I felt reinvigorated, ready to take a fresh look at the questions that had puzzled me. I could discern three large scale principles at work in deciding whom to include and whom to exclude from the liberal tent. One is postmodernism. One is smartness. And the third, seen clearly in Zootopia , is a consensus about the reality of certain kinds of suffering and trauma. During the past few decades, the importance of smartness has if anything increased. A college education has become a basic requirement for being middle class, and parents of all political stripes scrabble desperately to get their children into the 'best' schools. The credentialing sectors of capitalism have been dominated by liberals for decades, but only recently have we successfully leveraged this strategic asset into the idea that liberals are basically the same as educated people. Other sites of cultural production – Hollywood, television, marketing, social media corporations – are also stereotypically liberal, and have become much more responsive to pressure from progressives. Movies like Zootopia , watched by millions of parents and children, show how it is possible to direct corporate power toward positive goals. We have succeeded in dividing capitalism into two halves, one still ugly and irredeemable, but the other (the cultural and credentialing sectors) tamed, dynamic, and fashionable. We absorb into our alliance everyone from marketing professionals to college professors to people who just like the Daily Show, reinforcing our sense of truth by identifying things as stupid, backwards, or insane. Looking now at the other two principles – postmodernism and suffering – Wendy Brown foretold that, as foci, they would be unable to coexist. Since the time of her prediction, the balance between the two has shifted dramatically, and it has become clear that Brown was rooting for the losing side. Postmodernism lamented the modern world's lack of orienting fixed points, and maybe tried to make a virtue out of this disorientation. Maybe, as I suggested to Foucault, it tried to establish the insistent assertion of the lack of fixed points as its own fixed point, and then covered the maneuver in a bewildering morass of verbiage. The contrast with the familiar liberalism of today is stark. We have reconstructed ourselves as progressives, burying postmodernism and reconstituting a robust sense of absolute morality and truth. The process took some time to gather steam, but is now at the helm of mainstream culture. Although we believe in some positive ideals like education, we have been especially successful at vanquishing the corrosive doubts of postmodernism by setting up negative ideals as transcendentally true. At the center of our imagination are atrocities like slavery, genocide, rape – these no one can doubt, these are things to which at one's peril one refuses to kneel. Who can deny that they exist, that they hurt, that they are evil? We therefore pick out vivid episodes in which certain groups of people suffered, and make it clear that anyone that does not ritually acknowledge the reality of their suffering is unworthy to be part of society. In this way, we manage to stigmatize horrible, regressive behavior, but that isn't enough. High profile instances of genocide and torture don't appear every day, and commitment flags without regular stimulation. And so we have taken seriously at least one idea from postmodernism, the fascination with slight conceptual nuances, and the faith or fear that these nuances can produce enormously consequential effects. We focus not just on torture but also on less obviously brutal but still hurtful behavior ('micro-aggressions'); not just on behavior but on language, not just on language but also on thoughts. By discouraging hurtful speech and sensitizing people to implicit bias, we make the world a more pleasant place. Critics of progressives complain about 'political correctness,' but you can't forge a unitary culture without imposing boundaries, and we mainly focus on obvious principles of good manners and consideration toward others. Zootopia as an Allegory Although there is still a long way to go, the progress of our culture toward liberation is historically unparalleled. Zootopia provides an extensive allegory about our achievement. We naturally dread the uncivilized past. One symbol of the past is the pathetic figure of Judy's parents, who tell her to settle and not follow her dreams. More frighteningly, the plot of the movie revolves around the mysterious fact that some animals are reverting to wildness – the past is thus not merely the past, but threatens to return. There is a still more insidious threat, which is the possibility that some part of the past remains lodged inside of us, like the specks of evil that St. Augustine once believed that God places in us in order to foil our efforts to attain goodness on our own. This fear is hardly surprising, given that we have come to a consensus that certain ways of talking that just twenty or even ten years ago passed without comment in liberal circles are, in reality, clearly problematic. The climax of Zootopia is when Judy, without any selfish or cruel intent, loses control of her mouth – and primitive, nonprogressive ideas escape from it. Zootopia doesn't merely show us the shadow of the past, but also offers us, as individuals, hope in the exciting future. Judy avoids becoming a carrot farmer like her parents, and is able to move past the degrading experience of working as a 'meter maid.' By virtue of being impressive, competent, and using the rules in her favor, she is able to rise to the top and be valued for her abilities. Leftists often worry that professional success can lead to people losing their moral compass. Zootopia offers a helpful perspective on this dilemma. When Judy reaches the pinnacle of success, that is precisely when she messes up and says problematic things. At first glance, Zootopia seems to suggest that morality is far more important than worldly success. Judy responds to her fault by taking a leave of absence from her job and feeling terrible. In the end, she is only able to redeem herself by treating herself as utterly worthless: by confessing abjectly to Nick, pronouncing herself damned, and handing him the only key that can set her free. I now realized, though, that the message of the movie was optimistic. True, if we say or think wrong things, we need to respond seriously, the way Judy did. But if we do that – and if we express support for progressive ideals and acknowledge our privilege – then we can be as successful as we want to be. There doesn't need to be any conflict between ambition and being a good person. That doesn't mean that liberals have to care about professional success. If you want to care about people in Africa or the plight of the working class, that's great, too. The important thing is that we come together on the important things, like basic moral principles and recognizing the suffering of marginalized groups. As this consensus consolidates, society will continue to progress. Some people will try to derail the process, maybe due to sensitivity about having been called out, or anger at losing their privilege. More and more, those people will be seen as throwbacks. Demographic forces will render them irrelevant. Maybe they will just be swept away by globalization. Or – maybe – they can work at the DMV. The Phantom A bell sounded and roused me from my vision of the future. There I saw a Phantom, draped and hooded, gliding like mist along the ground towards me. It was shrouded in a deep, black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing visible except one outstretched hand. 'The Spirit of Liberalism Yet To Come, I presume?' I asked. The Spirit did not answer. I felt a stab of fear at what it might show me. Would the current positive trajectory continue? Would the future bring cultural progress in ways I couldn't even imagine? Or would the 2020s instead feature a cyclical swing back to postmodernism? Or something worse still? The Spirit merely pointed onward with its hand. I followed it, and found myself listening to another speech, taking place not in the far future, but toward the end of 2016. Yet my sense of foreboding did not abate, and for apparently no reason at all, the cloud-capped towers and gorgeous palaces of my vision suddenly seemed insubstantial, and vain. I remain curious why the 'debate' over antiracism as a politics takes such indirect and evasive forms – like the analogizing and guilt by association, moralistic bombast in lieu of concrete argument – and why it persists in establishing, even often while denying the move, the terms of debate as race vs. class. He seemed to refer to 'antiracism' as if it were not an obviously good thing. I looked at his name plate. Adolph Reed? Who was this person? In the logic of antiracism, exposure of the racial element of an instance of wrongdoing will lead to a recognition of injustice, which will in turn lead to remedial action – though not much attentions seems ever given to how this part is supposed to work. I suspect this is because the exposure part, which feels so righteously yet undemandingly good, is the real focus. I did not understand why the sound of his voice troubled me so much. 'Spirit!' I exclaimed, 'this is a fearful place. I will not forget its lessons, trust me. Let me go!' But the Ghost only pointed, with an unmoved finger, at Reed, whose icy words burned in my ears. These responses [show] how fundamentally antiracism and other identitarian programs are not only the left wing of neoliberalism but active agencies in its imposition of a notion of the boundaries of the politically thinkable – sort of neoliberalism's intellectual and cultural border guard. 'Answer me one question,' I cried. 'Are the things Reed says the shadows of things to come, or are they merely his own cynical perspective?' I caught at the Spirit's spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but I persisted. Yet the Spirit was stronger than I was, and repulsed me. I fell to the ground, and when I arose, I was alone in the weeping land. * * * The series concludes tomorrow, with Outis reaching new conclusions and making an important decision.

Movies like Zootopia , watched by millions of parents and children, show how it is possible to direct corporate power toward positive goals. We have succeeded in dividing capitalism into two halves, one still ugly and irredeemable, but the other (the cultural and credentialing sectors) tamed, dynamic, and fashionable. We absorb into our alliance everyone from marketing professionals to college professors to people who just like the Daily Show, reinforcing our sense of truth by identifying things as stupid, backwards, or insane. Looking now at the other two principles – postmodernism and suffering – Wendy Brown foretold that, as foci, they would be unable to coexist. Since the time of her prediction, the balance between the two has shifted dramatically, and it has become clear that Brown was rooting for the losing side. Postmodernism lamented the modern world's lack of orienting fixed points, and maybe tried to make a virtue out of this disorientation. Maybe, as I suggested to Foucault, it tried to establish the insistent assertion of the lack of fixed points as its own fixed point, and then covered the maneuver in a bewildering morass of verbiage. The contrast with the familiar liberalism of today is stark. We have reconstructed ourselves as progressives, burying postmodernism and reconstituting a robust sense of absolute morality and truth. The process took some time to gather steam, but is now at the helm of mainstream culture. Although we believe in some positive ideals like education, we have been especially successful at vanquishing the corrosive doubts of postmodernism by setting up negative ideals as transcendentally true. At the center of our imagination are atrocities like slavery, genocide, rape – these no one can doubt, these are things to which at one's peril one refuses to kneel. Who can deny that they exist, that they hurt, that they are evil? We therefore pick out vivid episodes in which certain groups of people suffered, and make it clear that anyone that does not ritually acknowledge the reality of their suffering is unworthy to be part of society. In this way, we manage to stigmatize horrible, regressive behavior, but that isn't enough. High profile instances of genocide and torture don't appear every day, and commitment flags without regular stimulation. And so we have taken seriously at least one idea from postmodernism, the fascination with slight conceptual nuances, and the faith or fear that these nuances can produce enormously consequential effects. We focus not just on torture but also on less obviously brutal but still hurtful behavior ('micro-aggressions'); not just on behavior but on language, not just on language but also on thoughts. By discouraging hurtful speech and sensitizing people to implicit bias, we make the world a more pleasant place. Critics of progressives complain about 'political correctness,' but you can't forge a unitary culture without imposing boundaries, and we mainly focus on obvious principles of good manners and consideration toward others. Zootopia as an Allegory Although there is still a long way to go, the progress of our culture toward liberation is historically unparalleled. Zootopia provides an extensive allegory about our achievement. We naturally dread the uncivilized past. One symbol of the past is the pathetic figure of Judy's parents, who tell her to settle and not follow her dreams. More frighteningly, the plot of the movie revolves around the mysterious fact that some animals are reverting to wildness – the past is thus not merely the past, but threatens to return. There is a still more insidious threat, which is the possibility that some part of the past remains lodged inside of us, like the specks of evil that St. Augustine once believed that God places in us in order to foil our efforts to attain goodness on our own. This fear is hardly surprising, given that we have come to a consensus that certain ways of talking that just twenty or even ten years ago passed without comment in liberal circles are, in reality, clearly problematic. The climax of Zootopia is when Judy, without any selfish or cruel intent, loses control of her mouth – and primitive, nonprogressive ideas escape from it. Zootopia doesn't merely show us the shadow of the past, but also offers us, as individuals, hope in the exciting future. Judy avoids becoming a carrot farmer like her parents, and is able to move past the degrading experience of working as a 'meter maid.' By virtue of being impressive, competent, and using the rules in her favor, she is able to rise to the top and be valued for her abilities. Leftists often worry that professional success can lead to people losing their moral compass. Zootopia offers a helpful perspective on this dilemma. When Judy reaches the pinnacle of success, that is precisely when she messes up and says problematic things. At first glance, Zootopia seems to suggest that morality is far more important than worldly success. Judy responds to her fault by taking a leave of absence from her job and feeling terrible. In the end, she is only able to redeem herself by treating herself as utterly worthless: by confessing abjectly to Nick, pronouncing herself damned, and handing him the only key that can set her free. I now realized, though, that the message of the movie was optimistic. True, if we say or think wrong things, we need to respond seriously, the way Judy did. But if we do that – and if we express support for progressive ideals and acknowledge our privilege – then we can be as successful as we want to be. There doesn't need to be any conflict between ambition and being a good person. That doesn't mean that liberals have to care about professional success. If you want to care about people in Africa or the plight of the working class, that's great, too. The important thing is that we come together on the important things, like basic moral principles and recognizing the suffering of marginalized groups. As this consensus consolidates, society will continue to progress. Some people will try to derail the process, maybe due to sensitivity about having been called out, or anger at losing their privilege. More and more, those people will be seen as throwbacks. Demographic forces will render them irrelevant. Maybe they will just be swept away by globalization. Or – maybe – they can work at the DMV. The Phantom A bell sounded and roused me from my vision of the future. There I saw a Phantom, draped and hooded, gliding like mist along the ground towards me. It was shrouded in a deep, black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing visible except one outstretched hand. 'The Spirit of Liberalism Yet To Come, I presume?' I asked. The Spirit did not answer. I felt a stab of fear at what it might show me. Would the current positive trajectory continue? Would the future bring cultural progress in ways I couldn't even imagine? Or would the 2020s instead feature a cyclical swing back to postmodernism? Or something worse still? The Spirit merely pointed onward with its hand. I followed it, and found myself listening to another speech, taking place not in the far future, but toward the end of 2016. Yet my sense of foreboding did not abate, and for apparently no reason at all, the cloud-capped towers and gorgeous palaces of my vision suddenly seemed insubstantial, and vain. I remain curious why the 'debate' over antiracism as a politics takes such indirect and evasive forms – like the analogizing and guilt by association, moralistic bombast in lieu of concrete argument – and why it persists in establishing, even often while denying the move, the terms of debate as race vs. class. He seemed to refer to 'antiracism' as if it were not an obviously good thing. I looked at his name plate. Adolph Reed? Who was this person? In the logic of antiracism, exposure of the racial element of an instance of wrongdoing will lead to a recognition of injustice, which will in turn lead to remedial action – though not much attentions seems ever given to how this part is supposed to work. I suspect this is because the exposure part, which feels so righteously yet undemandingly good, is the real focus. I did not understand why the sound of his voice troubled me so much. 'Spirit!' I exclaimed, 'this is a fearful place. I will not forget its lessons, trust me. Let me go!' But the Ghost only pointed, with an unmoved finger, at Reed, whose icy words burned in my ears. These responses [show] how fundamentally antiracism and other identitarian programs are not only the left wing of neoliberalism but active agencies in its imposition of a notion of the boundaries of the politically thinkable – sort of neoliberalism's intellectual and cultural border guard. 'Answer me one question,' I cried. 'Are the things Reed says the shadows of things to come, or are they merely his own cynical perspective?' I caught at the Spirit's spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but I persisted. Yet the Spirit was stronger than I was, and repulsed me. I fell to the ground, and when I arose, I was alone in the weeping land. * * * The series concludes tomorrow, with Outis reaching new conclusions and making an important decision.

ARTICLE

  
By Jerri-Lynn Scofield, who has worked as a securities lawyer and a derivatives trader. She now spends most of her time in India and other parts of Asia researching a book about textile artisans. She also writes regularly about legal, political economy, and regulatory topics for various consulting clients and publications, as well as writes occasional travel pieces for The National . 
All right, all right. I can't take it any more. Yesterday I read a Facebook post that blamed the current US electoral predicament on the 'pointless' 22nd Amendment. For those of you without a US Constitution handy, the 22nd Amendment is the one that limits US presidents to serving two terms. 
That Facebook post implies that without the 22nd Amendment we'd get to see a third term for the Obamamometer . That risible suggestion, combined with the incessant legacy-burnishing that he's indulged in– at least until he realized that HRC might be in trouble and started to hit the campaign trail in earnest– made me realize the time for shredding aspects of that legacy is way overdue. 
When the Obamamometer finally settles on what he'll do next– whether that would be run a sports team, become a venture capitalist, found a new religion, cure cancer, or merely hob nob with the global elite and play lots of golf, I'm sure he'll make a fine job job of it– just as he's done with his Presidency. Over the next couple of months, I intend to post occasionally on this legacy: but rather than burnishing that record, I'll indulge in a bit of legacy busting. 
First up, the rule of law and corporate crime. 
The Holder Doctrine 
Federal prosecutors, and regulatory agencies, have turned into toothless tigers when it comes to prosecuting C-suite types, and pursuing corporations seriously, for economic crimes. Both financial institutions and their management got virtually a free pass for their activities that led to the Great Recession. And not only for those, but for subsequent foreclosure abuses, LIBOR and other market manipulations, money laundering, tax scams, and doing business contrary to US sanctions policy. Yet to date, not a single C-suite type has been indicted. 
It's not just financial institutions that've received a free pass. Big Pharma, for example, has also been lucky, as have companies that have engaged in creative tax minimization strategies (Apple, anyone?). And if looked at from the perspective of legal topics, rather than corporate actors, entire areas of law– antitrust, for example– are not really relevant anymore. 
You don't have to take my word for it. No less a source than the NY Times' DealBook column– not a venue, incidentally, renowned for its trenchant, timely critiques of either Wall Street or other corporate behavior– in September lamented, Law Enforcement 'Not Winning' War on White Collar Crime . I wrote about this article in a September post and so won't rehash all the arguments I made then here. But a few points are in order. 
The lack of enforcement not only means that the guilty don't pay. It also determines what corporate strategies get pursued, which business models are developed or rejected, what attitudes corporations take to risk, and how resources get allocated to name just a few consequences. And as I'll discuss below, it also shapes how attorneys practice law, and the impact their advice carries in deterring certain types of corporate behavior. 
I never thought I'd be nostalgic for President George W. Bush's Department of Justice (DoJ). Now, I'm well aware of the scandal that ensued over Attorney General Alfred Gonzales imposing ideological litmus tests on assistant US attornies. Nonetheless, in the wake of the collapse of the dotcom bubble, the Bush DoJ actually enforced the law. It prosecuted cases and claimed scalps. Companies such as Adelphi, Enron and WorldCom all saw top-level management prosecuted, and malefactors sent to jail. 
Change We Can't Believe In 
Those who voted for Hope and Change in 2008 certainly got the change part– at least with respect to the DoJ. But when we look at the DoJ's enforcement priorities and the track record that followed, it's perhaps not the change they were hoping for. The Obamamometer's first Attorney General, Eric Holder, outlined and followed what came to be known as the Holder doctrine. 
Allow me to quote from my September post: 
[Under the Holder doctrine the DoJ eschewed corporate charges against companies and executives, instead opting for negotiated settlements (often imposing de minimis, slap-on-the wrist penalties that were significantly undersized compared to the magnitude of damage done, especially by TBTF banks and other financial predators, to name just a few). 
The DoJ under Obama's second AG, Loretta Lynch, originally followed the Holder doctrine, until that was superseded when Deputy Attorney General Sally Quillian Yates authored a memo outlining a new approach in September 2015. Under this approach, the DoJ intended to increase accountability for corporate wrongdoing, and this included an increased focus on pursuing criminal charges against responsible individuals. The DoJ sought to drive a legal wedge between individuals and the corporations for whom they worked by only allowing corporations to receive 'cooperation credit' that would reduce their potential exposure (including penalties) if the corporation cooperates in surrendering as early as possible comprehensive detailed information concerning the individual misconduct. 
There's much more in a similar vein in that earlier post, for those with an interest. But the bottom line for purposes of this post is what has this supposed policy shift, from Holder's doctrine to Yates's memo, meant in practice. The short answer: bupkis. We're still waiting for the more robust enforcement approach the Yates memo supposedly heralded to kick in. As an attorney I know who specializes in white collar defense work summed it up to me, 'The DoJ's walking a new walk, and talking a new talk, but nothing's really changed.' 
In fact, in only two areas have we seen the DoJ take a muscular approach toward enforcement during the Obamamometer's administration, insider trading, and offenses under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). 
Insider Trading 
US Attorney for the southern district of New York Preet Bharara has compiled an undefeated string of convictions for insider trading (some of which may be at risk of being overturned due to some appellate decisions, which are beyond the scope of this post). But as I wrote last month in The SEC Fiddles While the System Burns: Insider Trading Enforcement As Securities Law Theater , focusing on insider trading as an enforcement priority constitutes a form of securities law theater. Scare prosecutorial resources are expended on insider trading abuses, rather than being deployed to investigate, punish, and (hopefully) deter, far more serious systemic problems. 
The insider trading focus provides the illusion that the DoJ is doing something about high-level cheating. Yet it has little broader deterrent effect on stymieing the wider corporate scams that misallocate resources and erode confidence in the integrity of the system. Insider trading enforcement is usually directed at individuals, and doesn't implicate wider considerations of corporate strategy or policy. Prosecuting insider traders maintains the myth that the greatest threats to US capitalism are individual bad corporate actors, rather than anything more sweeping or systemic. Catch the bad actors, fine them or throw them in jail, and never think about any deeper problems. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
Another area highlighted as an enforcement priority is bribery and foreign corruption, with prosecutions undertaken under authority of the FCPA. Allow me to quote from a speech made by assistant attorney general Leslie R. Caldwell last week: 
The effects of foreign corruption are not just felt overseas. In today's global economy, the negative effects of foreign corruption flow back to the United States. American companies are harmed by global corruption when they are denied the ability to compete in a fair and transparent marketplace. Instead of being rewarded for their efficiency, innovation and honest business practices, U.S. companies suffer at the hands of corrupt governments and lose out to corrupt competitors. 
…. 
This is why the fight against international corruption has been, and continues to be, a core priority of the Department of Justice. It has been a core priority for the Criminal Division, and our commitment to the fight against foreign bribery is reflected in our robust enforcement record in this area, which includes charges against corporations and individuals alike from all over the world. Since 2009, the Criminal Division's Fraud Section has convicted more than 65 individuals in [FCPA] and FCPA-related cases, and resolved criminal cases against more than 65 companies with penalties and forfeiture of approximately $4.5 billion. 
Sounds reasonable, right? I mean, after all, no one would come right out in favor of more international corruption? 
But when we unpack it, we butt up against a few problems. First, to quote my contact the white collar defence specialist again. The lack of an effective DoJ deterrent has enormously complicated his practice and his ability to get his clients to understand and act on prudent legal advice. 'What I've seen happening more and more in the last couple of years is the chairs of audit committees of major companies openly mocking the DoJ's enforcement capability.' This leads the companies to pursue courses of action that they wouldn't dare to undertake if they worried that the DoJ would aggressively pursue securities law violations. 
Where does this leave their lawyers? Well, it often means that they must either moderate their advice, or risk losing their clients. Clients who want to do something will resist their impulses and continue to listen to what they hear as their lawyers crying wolf only for so long. Eventually, the less scrupulous among them are going to ignore the contrary advice, or get another lawyer. The lack of effective enforcement at the DoJ hinders the efforts of the best, most prudent, and most ethical members of the legal profession to practice law as we would want them to. 
So, what happens instead? Well, the most scrupulous of them will continue to give what they regard as sound legal advice (even if what some privately call the Department of Jokes does not enforce the law in a way that lends credence to that approach). But that means they often have to develop new areas of expertise when their clients beat a path away from their doors. 'We have to act sometimes as shoe salesmen, flogging competence in FCPA violations, that occur in subsidiaries or with foreign suppliers,' says my white collar defense specialist contact. 'This work leads us to countries and legal systems we don't know well, to uncover chickenshit violations that occur far from home.' Far better, he believes, would be for the DoJ to focus on law-breaking that occurs in the United States, as that could be effectively deterred by the agency refocusing its enforcement priorities. Now that would be a legacy we could all believe in. 
Bottom Line 
On the contrary, one persistent legacy of the Obamamometer is to say one thing and then do another. The DoJ has recently signalled its intention to get tougher on white collar crime. But so far, there's been no follow through on the rhetoric. Instead, we see federal prosecutors either turning a blind eye to major problems, or conducting various forms of enforcement theater– much sound and fury, but in the end, signifying nothing. 
Some legacy!

D 20 
Legend: Leader and polling margin from RealClearPolitics . SoS's party from WikiPedia . A.G's party from Ballotpedia . 
* Previous week's margin in parenthesis (thus). Flipped states ( thus ). 
Still very much a horse-race; Clinton flipped Florida (though by a tiny amount); but Trump flipped Nevada and North Carolina. (All this data is averaged over the 10/26 – 11/6 time frame, and I can't imagine they capture late shifts in any direction.) To the Times interactive once again : 
Remember the interactive focuses on swing states, listed in the table above. We give Trump every state where he is ahead: Ohio, North Carolina, Nevada (!), Iowa. Trump has 44 paths to victory; Clinton, 19. We reserve Florida and New Hampshire, because Clinton's margin in both states is razor thin, and give her Virgina, Pennsylvania, Wisconson, and Colorado: 
So even if Trump wins Florida, he has to win New Hampshire, too. Hoo boy. And to think all this campaign had to do was gag him and take away the Android phone he was tweeting from. The slightest bit of self-discipline on Trump's part, and Clinton is suddenly in the race of her life. Shows her extreme weakness as a candidate, and the decadence of the Democrat nomenklatura that forced her nomination through, not to mention the decadence of the political class, which can't seem to get approximately half the electorat to accept their view that Trump is history's worst monster, despite extraordinary unity of purpose and a deluge of propaganda. Prediction: This election will resolve nothing, and volatility will increase. 
Now let's look at the House and Senate: 
This week, the House: 
Looking good for our friend, gridlock. 
This week, the Senate: 
Last week: 
It's a tossup (though you've gotta note 7 of the 8 toss-ups are Republicans. I wonder if the coin will land on its edge?

A pure play in paraphernalia. 
Our Famously Free Press 
The Voters 
'The Verifier – Polling Place Equipment – 2016' [ Verified Voting ]. Handy tool that shows voting systems state-by-state. 
'[E]lectronic voting machines aren't as commonplace as one might assume. Three-quarters of the country will vote on a paper ballot this fall, says Pamela Smith, president of Verified Voting, a group that promotes best practices at the polls. Only five states—Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, and New Jersey—use 'direct recording electronic' (DRE) machines exclusively. But lots of other states use electronic machines in some capacity' [ Wired ].

'MIAMI CUBANS 4 TRUMP AND THE BATTLE FOR THE NATION' [ Cuba Counterpoints (MsExPat)]. 
'[Philadelphia's] crippling weeklong transit strike ended early Monday, ensuring that all buses, trolleys and subways will be up and running by Election Day' [ AP ]. 
Downballot 
'As the final, frantic hours of the campaign for control of Congress come to a close, Democrats look like slightly-better-than-even favorites to reclaim the Senate, while Republicans appear certain to hold the House after a Donald Trump-induced October scare' [ Politico ]. 'If Democrats manage to flip the Senate, senior party aides and strategists involved in battleground races said they're looking at a majority of 52 seats, best case. That would be a letdown from their earlier hopes of a 54- or 55-seat advantage and put Republicans in the pole position to win back the chamber in 2018.' 
The Trail 
Best pro-Trump piece I've seen: 'The GOP's 'Ungrateful Bastard' Caucus' [ American Greatness ]. 
Best pro-Clinton piece remains: 'Vote for the Lying Neoliberal Warmonger: It's Important' [ Common Dreams ]. 
The best reasons I can think of to vote for each candidate (as opposed to against the other candidates). In no particular order: Trump: A realist foreign policy Clinton: More of the same Stein: Break the two-party duopoloy Johnson: Sanity on marijuna legalization 
These reasons are, of course, entirely incommensurate. 
'The American Conservative Presidential Symposium' [ The American Conservative ]. Michael Tracey: 'Trump might be better than Hillary on foreign policy (my top issue), but he's far too volatile to conclude that with any certainty, and he may well end up being catastrophically worse. The Clintons' outrageous stoking of a war fervor over Russia is quite simply depraved and should disqualify them from reentering the White House…. Democrats deserve punishment for nominating a candidate with such severe legal problems, stifling a genuine populist insurgent in the most craven possible fashion (I supported Bernie Sanders but find his recent hectoring pro-Clinton conduct highly off-putting). Their shambolic, 'rigged' primary process can't be countenanced, nor can the 2016 electoral debacle as a whole, so I'll do my small part in rejecting this horror show by declining to vote.' 
Realignment 
'America's Ruling Elite Has Failed and Deserves to Be Fired' [ Of Two Minds ]. ' The last failed remnants of the state-cartel hierarchies left over from World War II must implode before we can move forward. Healthcare, defense, pharmaceuticals, higher education, the mainstream media and the systems of governance must all decay to the point that no one can be protected from the destructive consequences of their failure, and no paychecks can be issued by these failed systems.' Tellingly, the author omits the FIRE sector. So I would say their definition of elite is odd. 
'[E]ducation levels are a more significant factor this year. Obama won a majority of those with a high school diploma (or less) in 2012, while Romney won college-educated voters. This year the numbers are reversed. Among white voters with only a high school education, Trump leads by over 25 points. Among whites with a college degree, Clinton leads by about 10 percent. This is the first time since serious polling began in 1952 that this has happened [ RealClearPoltiics ]. And when I ask myself who sent the United States heading toward Third World status, it's not those without college degrees. In fact, it's Clinton's base. 
'The Last Gasp of the American Dream' [ The Archdruid Report ]. 
[M]illions of Americans trudge through a bleak round of layoffs, wage cuts, part-time jobs at minimal pay, and system-wide dysfunction. The crisis hasn't hit yet, but those members of the political class who think that the people who used to be rock-solid American patriots will turn out en masse to keep today's apparatchiks secure in their comfortable lifestyles have, as the saying goes, another think coming. Nor is it irrelevant that most of the enlisted personnel in the armed forces, who are the US government's ultimate bulwark against popular unrest, come from the very classes that have lost faith most drastically in the American system. The one significant difference between the Soviet case and the American one at this stage of the game is that Soviet citizens had no choice but to accept the leaders the Communist Party of the USSR foisted off on them, from Brezhnev to Andropov to Chernenko to Gorbachev, until the system collapsed of its own weight… 
If George W. Bush was our Leonid Brezhnev, as I'd suggest, and Barack Obama is our Yuri Andropov, Hillary Clinton is running for the position of Konstantin Chernenko; her running mate Tim Kaine, in turn, is waiting in the wings as a suitably idealistic and clueless Mikhail Gorbachev, under whom the whole shebang can promptly go to bits. While I don't seriously expect the trajectory of the United States to parallel that of the Soviet Union anything like as precisely as this satiric metaphor would suggest, the basic pattern of cascading dysfunction ending in political collapse is quite a common thing in history, and a galaxy of parallels suggests that the same thing could very easily happen here within the next decade or so. The serene conviction among the political class and their affluent hangers-on that nothing of the sort could possibly take place is just another factor making it more likely. 
'Why Trump Is Different—and Must Be Repelled' [Adam Gopnik, The New Yorker ]. 
For the past months, and into this final week, as for much of the past year, many New Yorkers have been in a position that recalls parents with a colicky baby: you put the baby down at last, it seems safely asleep, grateful and unbelievably exhausted you return to bed—only to hear the small tell-tale cough or sob that guarantees another crying jag is on the way. The parents in this case, to fill in the metaphorical blanks, are liberal-minded folk; the baby's cries are any indicators that Donald Trump may not be out of the race for President—as he seemed to be even as recently as last week—and may actually have a real chance at being elected. Disbelief crowds exhaustion: this can't be happening. If the colicky baby is a metaphor too sweet for so infantile a figure as the orange menace, then let us think instead, perhaps, of the killer in a teen horror movie of the vintage kind: every time Freddy seemed dispatched and buried, there he was leaping up again, as the teens caught their breath and returned, too soon, to their teendom. 
Of course, Gopnik — a bad-faith liberal who should really stick to writing gauzy atmospheric pieces about Paris — is both passive-aggressive and infuriatingly smug. To 'fill in the metaphorical blanks,' both the 'colicky baby' and the teen horror movie villain are infantilized and displaced versions of The Other: The Trump voter that Eurostar-rider Gopnik hates and fears, because he's afraid their going to kill him and take his stuff.

Stats Watch 
Gallup US Consumer Spending Measure, October 2016: ' In October, Americans' daily self-reports of spending averaged $93, similar to September's $91 average. However, it is among the highest for the month of October in the survey's nine-year trend' [ Econoday ]. 'The latest spending average is similar to the $91 recorded in October 2008, a measure taken at the beginning of a steep slide in Americans' spending amid the financial crisis of 2008.' Eight years of crap and back to square one, except for the lost wealth, of course. Best economy ever! 
Labor Market Conditions Index, October 2016: 'Average hourly earnings are one of 19 indicators tracked in the labor market conditions index but the component no doubt made an outsized contribution to the October composite which rose' [ Econoday ]. (This is the Fed's experimental index.) 'Elements of last week's employment report, especially wages, are consistent with a pivot higher for the labor market and today's gain in this index could be offering its own signpost.' Dear Lord, a 'pivot. I thought 'pivot' was a Beltway word, but it seems to have migrated. Ugh. 
Employment Situation (11/4): '[T]he deceleration of employment growth continues in what's now been a very steady decline going on 2 years. And with employment growth decelerating at this rate it's likely the unemployment rate will remain elevated indefinitely' [ Mosler Economics ]. 
Real Estate: 'When it comes to the state of the industrial real estate market, landlords continue to have the upper hand over tenants, due to ongoing market factors, according to the Third Quarter Industrial Outlook report recently issued by commercial real estate firm JLL' [ Logistics Management ]. 'Looking at total U.S. absorption, JLL observed that more than one-third is derived from four key markets that indicate a bulk of the activity still remains in primary industrial cities. These markets include: Chicago at 6.4 percent; Houston at 8.5 percent; Dallas/Fort Worth at 8.6 percent; and Philadelphia/Harrisburg at 10.5 percent…. When asked to rank the top three types of occupiers for industrial estate property at the moment, [Aaron Ahlburn, director of industrial research for JLL] cited e-commerce, traditional retail, and 3PL [third-party logistics] and logistics/parcel delivery players.' So, a bet on continued globalization? 
Shipping: 'Truck, rail pricing power may shift in early 2017' [ Journal of Commerce ]. 'Shippers moving freight throughout the US are enjoying the kind of pricing power they usually only hold during recessions, thanks to a thick layer of excess truck capacity and overstocked inventories, combined with lower fuel costs and fuel surcharges. The strong dollar and skittish consumer demand, at least for items bigger than packages, also play a role.' Weirdly, the happy talk headline isn't supported by any data in the article. 
Shipping: 'Calls grow for Pakistan to adopt shipbreaking code in wake of last week's deadly inferno' [ Splash247 ]. 'The speakers at the [National Trade Union Federation] protest called for a shipbreaking code to be instituted in Pakistan, noting how workplace accidents at Indian breaking yards had dropped since New Delhi put in its own ship recycling regulations.'

Class Warfare 
On neoliberalism [Matt Stoller, Facebook , via Atrios ]. 
Neoliberalism is a kind of statecraft. It means organizing state policies by making them appear as if they are the consequences of depoliticized financial markets. It involves moving power from public institutions to private institutions, and allowing governance to happen through concentrated financial power. Actual open markets for goods and services tend to disappear in neoliberal societies. Financial markets flourish, real markets morph into mass distribution middlemen like Walmart or Amazon. 
Neoliberalism is not faith in free markets. Neoliberalism is not free market capitalism. Neoliberalism is a specific form of statecraft that uses financial markets as a veil to disguise governing policies. 
What oft was thought but ne'er so well expressed 
Stoller is paraphrasing his review of Greta Krippner's Capitalizing on Crisis , which sounds well worth a read.

Yves here. What the informative post below fails to mention is that farm credit had become a hot political issue by the time the Farm Credit system was created. For more details on the struggle of indebted farmers to obtain political power, see The Populist Moment: A Short History of the Agrarian Revolt in America by Lawrence Goodwyn. As Matt Stoller wrote in 2010 : 
A lot of people forget that having debt you can't pay back really sucks. Debt is not just a credit instrument, it is an instrument of political and economic control. 
It's actually baked into our culture. The phrase 'the man', as in 'fight the man', referred originally to creditors. 'The man' in the 19th century stood for 'furnishing man', the merchant that sold 19th century sharecroppers and Southern farmers their supplies for the year, usually on credit. Farmers, often illiterate and certainly unable to understand the arrangements into which they were entering, were charged interest rates of 80-100 percent a year, with a lien places on their crops. When approaching a furnishing agent, who could grant them credit for seeds, equipment, even food itself, a farmer would meekly look down nervously as his debts were marked down in a notebook. At the end of a year, due to deflation and usury, farmers usually owed more than they started the year owing. Their land was often forfeit, and eventually most of them became tenant farmers. 
They were in hock to the man, and eventually became slaves to him. This structure, of sharecropping and usury, held together by political violence, continued into the 1960s in some areas of the South. As late as the 1960s, Kennedy would see rural poverty in Arkansas and pronounce it 'shocking'. These were the fruits of usury, a society built on unsustainable debt peonage. 
Today, we are in the midst of creating a second sharecropper society. I first heard the term 'slaves to the bank' from a constituent fighting a fraudulent foreclosure. The details aren't so important — this couple had been illegally placed in a predatory loan — but at one point, the wife explained that she and her husband were so scared they would have 'given their first born to the bank to keep their home'. That was fear speaking, total unadulterated panic. And as we watch debt-holders use the ornaments of fear, such a loan sharking company that set up fake courts to convince debtors they were losing cases, we should recognize that what the creditor class wants is what they've always wanted: total dominance of our culture. 
By Sarah Quin Assistant Professor, Sociology, University of Washington. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website Hoping to learn from other countries' experiences in organizing finance for agriculture, more than 150 Americans were sent abroad in the summer of 1913 to investigate the minutiae of farm-credit systems in and around Europe. 
They were sent as far north as Norway and as far south as Egypt, with Ireland and Russia marking the western and eastern boundaries of the study. They learned of microcredit-like experiments to support small-plot tenant farming in Italy. In France they were told how farm credit embodied democratic ideals. In the Netherlands and Spain, commission members found counterparts who, like the Americans were doing, had looked to other European nations for ways to improve the management of farm credit. Perhaps the most anticipated stop of this trip would be in Germany, whose system of long-term farm credit distribution had achieved world renown. 
The key ideas brought home from Europe by commission members more than a century ago still shape today's U.S. credit policy. The organizing principle of these ideas was the proposition that providing farm credit could be a low-cost and politically palatable form of economic policy through which government could help people help themselves. This paved the way for the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916, which redesigned the U.S. system from the ground up by creating a new network of government-supported farm credit cooperatives. 
The Act was arguably a watershed in the use of credit as a federal policy tool whose impact was felt far beyond the agricultural sector. Before 1916, the national government used credit allocation more sparingly, as a temporary means to support expensive internal developments such as railways. After the Act, there was a continual expansion of programs that bought, sold, issued, guaranteed, or otherwise promoted the flow of credit to specific sectors or groups. In the United States today, one third of privately issued debt is backed by the government, not only through the Fed but also through the $3.4 trillion in loans guaranteed or held through a vast network of federal credit programs (if you include implicit guarantees of financial debt, the amounts are much, much higher ). As Marianna Mazzucato and L. Randall Wray have noted , these forms of credit support are a central part of how the federal government participates in the U.S. economy. This proliferation of government credit allocation seems remarkable in light of longstanding political attitudes on government involvement in the economy. 
Farmers depend on credit for their livelihoods, using it not only to buy equipment and prepare land but also to feed their families in the lean months before the harvest. As the United States developed into an agricultural powerhouse , it faced a significant problem in moving capital reserves concentrated in eastern cities into the hands of small borrowers spread out across a vast and sparsely populated frontier. In the absence of modern day credit institutions, the West and South suffered destabilizing credit cycles of boom and bust, with mortgage rates sometimes twice as high as those in the Northeast. Many farmers believed that these higher rates were the unfair doings of parasitic financiers and middlemen. In the Jacksonian era, many farmers worried that government involvement in banks and credit would make the situation worse by adding corrupt politicians into the mix. Over time, however, Populist farmers came to believe that a stronger national government was needed to break bankers' stranglehold over the supply of credit. 
By the 1890s, the question of farm credit was a polarizing national issue: a proposal to offer credit and currency backed by local storage units (called the Subtreasury Plan) became a wedge issue that threatened to undermine the coalition that made up the Southern Democratic Party. Credit distribution was one of the most acrimonious and destabilizing class divides of the era, but by the middle of the decade these credit debates had been eclipsed by the politics of free silver. Left unresolved, the credit problem lingered. 
In the first decade of the 20th century, a group of progressive reformers rediscovered the issue of 'farm credits.' Worried about social disintegration in America's heartland in the wake of massive urbanization, these reformers came to view the stable and affordable supply of credit as essential to farmers' well-being, and through that, the well-being of the entire nation. But, being elites, they approached credit not as inherently exploitative so much as a technical problem to be solved. They looked to Europe for guidance and inspiration. Hence the tour. 
By the time committee members arrived in Germany, news of that country's farm-credit success had traveled around the world, and some of its techniques were already adopted by other nations such as France. German lecturers told the group that German agriculture thrived not because of the quality of German soil, but because of the quality of German credit. The Americans were especially interested in one type of credit institution — the Landschaften , a network of local cooperative banks that issued covered mortgage bonds called Pfandbriefe . These Pfandbriefe bore a decidedly modest 3%-4% return. 'The Germans prefer to sleep well rather than eat well,' one lecturer explained. 
The entire German credit system was built for stability rather than profit: it used conservative land valuations, careful regulatory standards, and local risk-sharing to assure its reliability. Whether this could be adapted to the American context was a serious question. A political economy professor lecturing in Halle warned the delegation that, while the Landschaften were the 'perfect' means of mortgage credit, differences in political systems could make the system untenable in the U.S. When a delegate asked how the Prussians dealt with defective land titles, the speaker simply dismissed the question: 'Well, that is an impossible thing in Prussia. We have no defective titles.' German farm credit distribution rested on a solid foundation of independent oversight and bureaucratic reliability. It was a far cry from the underdeveloped and scandal-ridden United States national government. 
The committee members returned home recognizing the technical superiority of the German system but debating its cultural and political adaptability to the United States. Would a conservative system of risk-sharing and oversight be embraced by Americans, who they deemed 'ambitious, individualistic, desirous of acquiring means and property'? Would government 'paternalism' kill Americans' entrepreneurial spirit? Would American society accept the principle that farmers deserved special treatment when it came to accessing credit? 
To overcome these objections, proponents of a European-inspired farm credit policy spun it as government helping people help themselves , providing credit support could through farmers' cooperatives. 
The divisive nineteenth century credit politics gave way to a vision of credit as an inoffensive means of economic development, of low cost to the state. Proponents argued that 'wise legislation' to lower credit risk could unlock the value of the nation's land, then estimated by one commentator at $40 billion. It was a huge potential payoff. Later scholars of credit programs would frequently note the same thing about the federal credit programs: compared to direct forms of welfare or other expenditures, credit support is cheap, since it can be implemented by government guarantees, tax expenditures, risk management techniques, and disbursements paid back over time, sometimes with interest. 
This logic was built into the structure of the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916. The centerpiece of the Act was a proposed local version of the German system. The Treasury was authorized to fund 12 reserve banks in order to funnel credit to a network of new farmers' lending cooperatives. The Department of Agriculture encouraged the formation of these lending cooperatives through a massive education effort. In a nod to American independence, the German system of risk sharing — in which members of the Landschaften were liable up to the full value of their property — was watered down. If the bank itself ran into trouble, American farmers would be liable for only 10% of their loan amount, rather than for the full value of their property. Since, over time, farmers could pay into the system and repay the state, the long-term costs of the program were expected to be low. Tax-exempt bonds would encourage a flow of funds into the reserve banks at the cost of some state revenue, but this was far less expensive than, say, directly subsidizing farmers. 
For all that the 12-bank structure mimicked the Federal Reserve Act, the creation of lending cooperatives meant that the FFLA was a far more complicated, experimental, and entrepreneurial design. A new system of farm credit was built from scratch. One observer at the time noted that 
[i]n spirit the Act was revolutionary — its authors were convinced that American methods were not worth saving. 
Not long after the passage of the Act, government officials recognized that the low cost and ideological palatability of the farm loan system could apply in other sectors. Credit support in the housing market ballooned during the Great Depression, and the postwar proliferation of credit as a tool of governance continues today. 
In the 'Analytical Perspectives' section of the President's budget, the chapter detailing the $3.4 trillion in loans held or guaranteed by the federal government reveals the diverse political uses of credit. Federal credit has military functions, including Defense Department loans for the purchase, stockpiling, and manufacturing of military materiel, and the Atomic Energy Commission's use of guarantees to encourage nuclear science. Credit is also a tool of foreign policy: the United States exports food to other nations through USAID. Loans can serve as disaster relief, as both FEMA and the SBA include credit support to assist with natural disasters, and the federal government also provides loans directly to states for this purpose. Credit is also extensively used as part of energy and environmental policy, with geothermal and renewable energy, biorefineries, and synthetic fuels having all benefited from credit support. Tracing its use in housing, David Freund notes that the appeal of credit programs is that they seem like small market corrections rather than consequential state policies. And they have been used to support every major sector of the American economy. 
The Analytical Perspectives of the budget wraps the complexities of these programs in the dry academic language of market corrections. 'Credit and insurance markets sometimes fail to function smoothly due to market imperfections … ' The implication is that this massive mobilization of debt and risk absorption by the federal government is best thought of as a technical adjustment to market imperfections, rather than, say, the American version of a developmental state. 
That language, I believe, is the moderate way of thinking about credit articulated during the progressive era, and now tailored for the neoliberal age. Like a nervous wizard, it asks us not to pay attention to the man behind the curtain, and for the most part, Americans comply. And why wouldn't they? After all, the idea that credit support does not ask us to think hard about the social and political conditions of possibility for market success has been part of the appeal of credit support all along. 0 0 0 0 0 0

by Outis Philalithopoulos In yesterday's episode of this series , Outis came up with an attractive synthesis about the trajectory of modern progressivism. He was then thrown into confusion by the arrival of a Phantom, and cryptic references to 'neoliberalism's intellectual and cultural border guard.' I felt like a snake, compelled to painfully tear away one skin after another. The outline of my conclusions was the same, but in the cold light of Reed's words, things somehow appeared differently. Is it true that we have surpassed postmodernism? We still look negatively at right wingers and others who believe in non-trendy absolutes. We still pay lip service to the idea that other cultures are just as praiseworthy as upper middle class American liberal culture. But looking beneath the surface, it does seem like postmodernism has been consigned to the graveyard of history. But rather than post-postmodernists who have learned from the mistakes of postmodernism, we are neo-modernists who have successfully forgotten that postmodernism ever existed. Already in the 90s, parts of the left/liberal world were uncomfortable with postmodernism, and Wendy Brown argued that they had set up their own 'reactionary foundationalism.' By that she meant that they had selected one aspect of their dogma, and then declared all attempts to interpret it critically to be subversive. Our newfound unity is based on two prongs. On the one hand, we have consolidated our alliance with key sectors of modern capitalism, and thereby cemented our branding as well-educated, intelligent people. It is working out wonderfully – but have we paid a price for it? Daniel Bell argued in 1976 ( The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism ) that conservatives supporting capitalism were thereby supporting a cultural engine that undermined the social values central to their conservatism. Have we, by letting the cultural arm of the economy fight our battles for us, clouded our ability to radically critique that economy? In the complex relationship between modern progressivism and the cultural sector of capitalism, who is using whom? On the other hand, we have fixed certain instances of suffering as foundational texts, and can now blast anyone who seems to doubt their centrality in understanding the world. Earlier attempts to create a liberal culture based on a consensus about oppression tended to produce a hodgepodge of groups that centrifugal forces could easily pull apart. What was different now? Maybe, as I had suggested to Foucault, the Internet had played a role. But 9/11 seemed relevant as well. As Osama bin Laden had hoped, the image of the planes striking the towers appeared on television as a dramatic flash of absolute reality. In the new rhetorical world thus created, 'squishy' postmodernism came off as inane and decadent; meanwhile, neocon Republicans happily twitted liberals over their lack of moral clarity. The Right surged from one apparent victory to another, while liberals seethed with humiliation. Maybe there was no epistemological breakthrough that enabled us to answer the postmodernists' gnawing doubts about objectivity. Maybe we changed the nature of liberalism, absorbed the stubborn moral clarity of Rush Limbaugh's conservatism, and went on to forge a rough-and-ready consensus between unruly interest groups, simply because we believed we had to. Morality As stylized images of suffering inject us with potent shots of certainty, we become addicted to empathy with suffering, as an antidote for existential disorientation. This leads to a natural desire to expand our attention to micro-aggressions and hurtful ways of thinking. But then, if we commit to being on the side of people who experience micro-aggressions, almost everyone might be able to find something in their life that could qualify. And in fact, many groups for whom we feel little sympathy are not unwilling to talk about their pain and humiliation. We have dodged this trap by finding a principle that will disqualify unintended groups from empathy – that way we can classify their pain as notreal. The simple rule that does the trick is: 'If a group has suffered something historical that we agree is really, unmistakably horrible , then it is also allowed to claim micro-aggressions as real.' We dress it up in academic language about what counts as 'structural' oppression, but in simple words, the rule is, 'if a group suffered, and we have canonized their suffering as a source of moral clarity for us , then they should be allowed to freely discover further incitements to suffering.' So in Judy's movie, mocking older people, or rural people, or government employees, or overweight people, is all entirely acceptable , while carrying around fox repellent, thinking a sheep's fur is fluffy, calling a bunny cute, or not supporting a baby fox who wants to be an elephant are all entirely unacceptable. T he principle isn't that prejudice is wrong. The principle is that the latter examples are code for liberal flash points. I thought about something Brown said: In its emergence as a protest against marginalization or subordination, politicized identity […] instills its pain over its unredeemed history in the very foundation of its political claim […] Politicized identity enunciates itself, makes claims for itself, only by entrenching, restating, dramatizing, and inscribing its pain in politics; it can hold out no future – for itself or others – that triumphs over this pain. By 'instilling' pain at the center of our epistemological universe, we condemn ourselves to endless efforts to shuttle around, direct, and amplify that pain. Brown emphasized revenge as a key technique in dealing with pain: […] a will that makes not only a psychological but a political practice of revenge, […] an identity whose present past is one of insistently unredeemable injury. Zootopia offers plenty of examples of hurting people the way they hurt others, so they can see what it feels like, and learn. The response to Nick tricking Judy and telling her 'it's a hustle, sweetheart' is for her to trick him and then announce, 'it's a hustle, sweetheart.' The same line is then used on the evil female sheep at the end of the movie. The movie sees cultural insensitivity as not only the primary evil in the world, but also the most appropriate punishment – the final prison episode also came to mind, when I had laughed at the evil sheep's anger at her wool getting touched. The culmination of Judy's apology is announcing that she really is 'just a dumb bunny' – her guilt is so great that she knows she deserves the pain of stereotyping. Brown worried about the insatiable dead end of 'insistently irredeemable injury.' Here, though, modern liberal culture proposesa way out of the cycle of suffering and revenge – Judy models it for us in her apology to Nick. If the oppressor voluntarily decides to submit to the worst tortures the oppressed can inflict, and to bind herself as an instrument of his revenge, then he may choose to forgive her, making possible a triumph over pain. I had always thought that when people do something wrong, they should just stop caring about their own feelings and, like Judy, really, deeply apologize. In the movie, Nick had forgiven her. But in real life, if someone apologized like that, say in a professional context, and the other person chose to be unmerciful – what then? Imagining the Future Wendy Brown said that right wing fundamentalists were trying to 'foreclose democratic conversation about our collective condition and future.' Are we doing the same thing? Adolph Reed maybe thought so. What did he mean when he said we had become 'border guards of neoliberalism,' policing 'the boundaries of the thinkable'? Of course we work hard to stigmatize certain sorts of prejudices. Do we thereby successfully repress them? Foucault, in his History of Sexuality , recalled that it is often supposed that the Victorian era's rules of manners and taboos on sexuality were aimed at making sex 'driven out, denied, and reduced to silence.' He argued instead that those restrictions had the effect, and maybe the purpose, of inciting and intensifying the power of sexuality: a 'complex deployment for compelling sex to speak, for fastening our attention and concern upon' it. If Foucault was right about sexuality, are our attempts at 'repressing' prejudice and trauma serving to amplify them as a force in society, by 'compelling prejudice and trauma to speak,' 'fastening our attention' upon them? Is the result then to drown out attempts to speak in other ways, and so to police 'the boundaries of the thinkable'? Is the neoliberal order safeguarded by the fact that certain conversations just don't happen in mainstream progressive circles? Well, it does seem that Star Trek is better at imagining an economic system without money than modern progressives Maybe we see a radical stance on the economy as a quick way to brand oneself as edgy, while privately assuming that there is no alternative to modern capitalism. If so, why continue to be so moralistic about it? Is our compulsive focus on mental sin a way we cover up despair at our inability to change the deep structure of the world? A lot of ordinary people are convinced not that capitalism is perfect, but that any alternative to it is will necessarily involve the collapse of technological civilization or severe restrictions on freedom. If this isn't true, are there some progressives trying to explain why? I struggled with what I had perceived. Were we, despite our idealistic vision of ourselves, simply agents of the system, tentacles that it uses to smash some people, complete with the pretext of defending others? Was it a labyrinthine, twisted joke? Hope At that point, I rebelled at the implications of my thought. Maybe modern progressives are much less self-critical than we imagined ourselves to be. Maybe we do indulge in some prejudices while criticizing and often tokenizing others. Maybe we have acquiesced in a long series of accommodations with power. But Polyphemus had spoken not just of wretchedness, but of idealism and grandeur. Maybe I didn't agree with the postmodernists after all. Maybe there is something good, or at least potentially good, in the way we have tried to turn back to sincerity and moral conviction, to humility and introspection. Brown said that in the postmodern world, individuals are buffeted and controlled by global configuations of […] power of extraordinary proportions, and are at the same time nakedly individuated, stripped of reprieve […] Since she wrote, the way the world makes many feel precarious and lost has only gotten worse. Maybe she was right that when we feel this way, we try to rebuild a sense of something we can really believe in. But was she right in assuming that this was mainly a bad thing? When Judy apologizes to Nick, she treats herself as utterly insignificant, and her victim as omnipotent, exactly mimicking the relationship between the sinner and God in traditional Christian confession. This was extreme, but could it also be seen as the sign of a great and widely-shared loneliness? Of the longing we feel for more dramatically intimate relationships between people, or between a person and some sort of transcendence? Could we salvage what was hopeful in modern progressivism and disentangle it from what wasn't? That sounds… hard, I thought to myself. Anyway, I'm dead. Maybe someone else will worry about it. Then I remembered Judy Hopps. She wouldn't accept me being dead as a reason for me not to try to help people. What could I do? 'Polyphemus,' I cried out. 'You're back.' He surveyed me. 'WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED?' his voice boomed. I thought for a moment. Then I realized how to solve this problem. 'Polyphemus,' I said. 'I have learned that I have been ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded. When I hear criticism of liberals that I don't want to think about, I deal with it by explaining how right-wingers caused the problem, or are worse than us, or are scary or horrible. Or I say the criticism is justified, but only as a criticism of not-real-progressives. Or I divert attention by accusing critics of ignoring the horrible things that have been done to marginalized people. I say I am against prejudice and trauma, but my attempts to repress certain forms of them have the predictable effect of intensifying their power throughout society. I say I am against prejudice, but I don't mind making fun of old people, Millennials, hicks, wingnuts, adults who live with their parents, and a whole slew of other categories and stereotypes.

In Why You Won't Get Your Day in Court in the New York Review of Books, judge Jed Rakoff offers a measured yet devastating critique of how all but the richest Americans lack effectively lack access to the courts. Rakoff, a highly regarded securities law expert best known for refusing to rubber-stamp SEC settlements that he deemed provided him with too little information to determine whether they were fair, walks through why Americans are shortchanged: 
Over the past few decades, ordinary US citizens have increasingly been denied effective access to their courts. There are many reasons for this. One is the ever greater cost of hiring a lawyer. A second factor is the increased expense, apart from legal fees, that a litigant must pay to pursue a lawsuit to conclusion. A third factor is increased unwillingness of lawyers to take a case on a contingent-fee basis when the anticipated monetary award is modest. A fourth factor is the decline of unions and other institutions that provide their members with free legal representation. A fifth factor is the imposition of mandatory arbitration. A sixth factor is judicial hostility to class action suits. A seventh factor is the increasing diversion of legal disputes to regulatory agencies. An eighth factor, in criminal cases, is the vastly increased risk of a heavy penalty in going to trial. 
For these and other reasons, many Americans with ordinary legal disputes never get the day in court that they imagined they were guaranteed by the law. A further result is that most legal disputes are rarely decided by judges, and almost never by juries. And still another result is that the function of the judiciary as a check on the power of the executive and legislative branches and as an independent forum for the resolution of legal disputes has substantially diminished—with the all-too-willing acquiescence of the judiciary itself. 
Rakoff goes through all of theses issues and explains the consequences, which include more people attempting to represent themselves in court, where they lose at a much higher rate than parties that have counsel. Readers of this site know how common it was during the foreclosure crisis for homeowners to attempt to defend themselves, with little success. Even now, I regularly have individuals who are trying to keep their homes or overturn a successful foreclosure e-mail me along with a long list of other people which regularly includes prominent officials like Elizabeth Warren. Even when they might have a germ of an argument, these missives are often so screechy and poorly organized that they come off as being the work of cranks rather than those at the end of their ropes. And this is reaction of someone sympathetic to the idea that the servicer done them wrong. 
As bad as the situation is in civil cases, it's worse on the criminal side of the bar. Even though defendants do get representation, court appointed lawyers are rarely a match for prosecutors. And the issue isn't simply that hiring good counsel is costly. It's also that the consequences of losing a criminal case are draconian, and even with the best representation, litigation is still a crapshoot. Recall that Aaron Swartz killed himself because the cost of defense in a Federal case starts at $1.5 million, which would have impoverished his parents, and if he lost, he faced up to 35 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million. 
Even in my very tame and cloistered social circle, the stories I have heard of encounters with the criminal justice system have been sobering. Someone I met in passing was charged criminally in a southern state for practicing medicine without a license. Even though he was not offering medical services or making medical claims, he'd been licensed as a osteopath in another state and his receptionist called him 'Dr. Marty,' which his clients took up. He did hire his own attorney rather than rely on a court defender, and went to trial rather than accept a plea bargain. He was confident he'd win because the prosecution presented no evidence (no witnesses, no documentary evidence) that he was practicing medicine, much the less that he'd done any harm. However, his attorney did not fight the venue being in an itty bitty backwater town, as opposed to the large city in which the defendant worked. As the local who recounted the tale said, judge and juries there are fixed all the time. 'Dr. Marty' lost on 16 counts and was sentenced to four years in prison. 
Similarly, I know a highly skilled former Wall Street tech expert, and am pretty confident that the professionals in his circle (who are shameless gossips) would not lie for him. The story that several parties independently recounted was that he dumb enough to not move out when a long-standing roommate turned to drug dealing. Mr. IT convinced himself he was not at risk as long as he never touched any illicit substances or handled cash. 
One evening, someone came and kept pounding on the door, threatening to (and sounding as if he could) knock it down. After increasingly loud efforts at breaking into the apartment to get his drugs, Mr. IT relented, and found and handed him the envelope and took money. Unbeknownst to him, his roommate had just been busted and told he needed to turn other people, and as a result, the buyer was wearing a wire. And the amount in the envelope was only a misdemeanor dealing amount but was marked up in the evidence room to a felony quantity. 
Mr. IT pled guilty and expected to go to prison. But because he was HIV positive and had spots on his face at his sentencing hearing, the prosecutor and judge figured he has Kaposi's sarcoma, and they'd rather have him die on his own nickel rather than get state support. So he got probation instead. It turned out that whatever he had wasn't that, and he's still alive. But the prosecution and felony conviction deeply traumatized him, as well as making it very difficult for him to find employment. 
I strongly urge you to read this important article in full . From its close: 
But while the larger solutions to this denial of access must await a change in the legislative climate, there is, I am convinced, no reason short of ignorance or ideology for judges to continue to give their approval to devices that effectively deny Americans access to their courts. The Supreme Court, for example, could easily overrule or at least narrow decisions like Concepcion and Chevron, on the ground that they deprive Americans of meaningful access to their courts. And lower court judges, state and federal, could take a harder look at some of the practices described here that have the same effect. 
This would require a considerable change of thought on the part of many judges. Indeed, it is hardly surprising that judges who often have substantial dockets tend to look favorably on arrangements that will lessen their work burden, whether by mandatory arbitration, denial of jurisdiction, reliance on prosecutors and administrators, or similar measures. Too often, however, such relief morphs into an effective reduction of judicial responsibility, with dire consequences for the long-term ability of the courts to serve as an effective check on the power of the legislature and the executive. Arguably even worse, the situation I've described reinforces the belief of citizens that the courts are not an institution to which they can turn for justice, but are simply a remote and expensive luxury reserved for the rich and powerful. If the judges themselves do not take steps to counter this insidious trend, who will? 0 0 0 0 0 0

By Silvia Merler, an Affiliate Fellow at Bruegel who formerly worked as Economic Analyst in DG Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Commission. Originally published at Bruegel Tim Duy 's Fed Watch says that, as expected, the Federal Reserve left policy unchanged this month and the statement itself was largely unchanged as well. The near term inflation outlook improved from September to November, and with the year-over-year impacts of oil prices falling out of the data, headline inflation will track back upwards, which is not a big surprise. With regards to the timing of the next move, Duy argues that the language suggests conditions are moving in the right direction, but the Fed is still waiting for some 'further' evidence. A continuation of recent trends will likely be sufficient as the 'further' evidence needed to justify a rate hike in December. Would a Trump victory derail a hike in December? Duy does not think this is likely at this juncture, and we should rather be focusing on the labour market. A slowdown in hiring to something closer to 100k a month would probably end the downward pressure on the unemployment rate and raise questions about the Fed's basic forecast that the unemployment rate will continue to decline in the absence of additional rate hikes. We get two employment reports before the December meeting. For the Fed to stay on the sidelines yet again, we probably need to see both reports come in weak. The bottom line is that the Fed is looking past the election to the December meeting for its second move in this rate hike cycle and probably it would take some unlikely softer numbers to hold them back again. Greg Ip , on the other hand, writes in The Wall Street Journal that Tuesday's election matters. Typically, the Fed is guided by the economic data and elections are just transitory nuisances with little significance for the outlook. But this is no typical election, as one of the candidates represents a dramatic break with economic orthodoxy – with promises of protectionism and tax cuts but few details. Trump's election would dramatically raise uncertainty, which is the reason why the stock market has tended to go down when his odds of winning go up. For the Fed, lower stock prices translate into less wealth, which is negative for the outlook in its own right. Additionally, the Fed will assume that uncertainty in the rest of the economy will mirror what happens in the markets. All of this reduces the odds it would actually raise interest rates in December. Ip argues that the Fed can take politics into consideration without being motivated by politics: when political decisions can potentially change the course of the economy, the Fed has to incorporate that into its decisions. Thus, a Trump victory would probably cast enough of a pall over the outlook to give the Fed reason to delay its next rate increase into next year. Ironically, Mr Trump may discover that he, not Mr Obama, is the reason the Fed hasn't tightened. Richard Clarida , commenting the FOMC statement over at PIMCO's blog, says that there was little expectation that the Fed would announce a hike in November. The committee members said nothing in their public remarks since the September meeting to suggest that a rate hike was under serious consideration this week. Indeed, the odds of a November hike as priced by the fed funds futures market were only 16%, and for at least the past 20 years the Fed has never moved when the market has priced less than a 50% chance of a move. As for the balance of risks, the language remained in the statement after making its first appearance this year in the September Fed statement. This is relevant because it would be difficult for the Fed to justify a hike if it believed that risks were tilted to the downside, or if the outlook were so uncertain it could not even characterise the risks. Clarida does not think that the Fed is trying to signal that the odds for a December hike have diminished. A year ago, the Fed wanted to boost market odds of a hike when it thought those odds were too low. Going into today – with those odds at 70% – the Fed appeared to be content to make minimal changes to the statement only six days before the US election. Whereas in September 2016 three FOMC members dissented, at this month's meeting dissenters were only two. So this Fed statement seems aimed at making as few waves as possible: it is a placeholder until the Fed next meets and a rate hike in December continues to be likely, if not a done deal. Natixis' Philippe Waechter argues that the Fed is ready for December, under the assumption that Clinton wins the election. He argues that the language on inflation is the only noticeable change in the language of this statement as compared to the previous one – together with the remarks on consumption that appears less strong than in September. The Fed wants to recover room for manoeuver in its monetary policy and this is the reason why it is by now ready to accept an increase in the rates. Nevertheless, it is also acting in a context where it needs to signal that it remains vigilant. In an asymmetric approach to monetary policy, the Fed prefers to act too late (at the risk of inflation) than too early (at the risk of a slowdown in economic activity). Tiffany Wilding , again on PIMCO's blog, looks at one indicator on which Fed's officials have recently trained a lens: the labour force participation rate. The participation rate has risen 0.5 percentage point over the past year, and the rise has occurred despite demographic and other secular trends implying that it should have declined about 0.3 ppt. During the news conference following the Federal Reserve's September meeting, chair Yellen highlighted this development as a reason to believe there is more slack in the labour market than previously thought. Wilding argues that the rise is not primarily the result of previously discouraged workers reentering the labour force, but stems largely from a decline in the number of long-term unemployed individuals (25 to 54-year-olds) dropping out. Notably, the decline comes on the heels of a very elevated pace of dropouts in 2014 and 2015, suggesting only limited scope for additional improvement. On the surface, it's a good sign that people are now looking for a job longer. However, the CPS data suggest the number of marginally attached and underemployed individuals as a percentage of the working-age population hasn't declined significantly since the participation rate started to increase last year. Taken together, these developments could indicate declining and more limited labor market slack. With respect to the participation rate, Wilding believes that the demographic and other secular forces which have driven trend declines in the participation rate will likely take over again. She views participation rate trends as a downside risk to the case for two to three hikes in the federal funds rate by the end of 2017. Meanwhile, Kenneth Rogoff says markets nowadays are fixated on how high the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in the next 12 months. This is dangerously shortsighted: the real concern ought to be how far it could cut rates in the next deep recession. Given that the Fed may struggle just to get its base interest rate up to 2% over the coming year, there will be very little room to cut if a recession hits. The two best ideas for dealing with the zero bound (negative rates and higher inflation target) are off-limits for the moment. Of course, there is always fiscal policy to provide economic stimulus. But it is extremely undesirable for government spending to have to be as volatile as it would be if it had to cover for the ineffectiveness of monetary policy. There may not be enough time before the next deep recession to lay the groundwork for effective negative-interest-rate policy or to phase in a higher inflation target. But that is no excuse for not starting to look hard at these options, especially if the alternatives are likely to be far more problematic. The Economist's Free Exchange argues that not every argument for keeping interest rates low is a good one. Central bankers may be too keen to spot inflation in the data, but if monetary policy operates with a lag, it makes sense to raise rates before you hit the target, to prevent overshoot. When doves reject this logic, they are implicitly criticising the Fed's 2% inflation target, not its strategy for achieving its goal. Inflation targets do not call for making up for past mistakes, and central banks should try to do what they say they are trying to do. This also means that in an equal and opposite situation where the Fed must bring inflation down after an upward shock, it should loosen policy while inflation still exceeds 2%. It is easy to dismiss these points as academic, given that inflation has been below target for too long. At present, the biggest threat to central bank credibility is clearly on the downside. But when doves deny the logic of changing policy in advance of achieving the inflation target, they overreach. The data show plenty to be dovish about: doves should simply point that out and, if they want a price level target, say as much. 0 0 0 0 0 0

Be sure to vote today if you haven't already! Even if you dislike the Presidential choices, downticket races are important. 
And an overdue note: Thanks SO much to those of you who came out to meet me in Dallas last week. We had a group of 30-35 attend, including someone from Iowa and a libertarian who declared that NC was one of only three non-libertarian sites that he reads. We have a lively discussion and I think everyone had a good time. 
The organizer of the evening, Steve in Dallas, circulated a list for people who wanted to be on a Dallas Meetup listserv. Some participants had already left by then, so if you missed the opportunity to sign up and would like to be included or missed this meetup but want to be kept in the loop, please ping me at yves_at_nakedcapitalism.com and I'll send your coordinates to Steve. Please put 'Dallas Meetup' in the subject line. 
At the end of the evening, Steve raised an important issue: he's tried getting friends and family members to read NC and other independent media, with much less success than he'd like. I volunteered that most people don't want to question authority, and that going outside the mainstream media was tantamount to admitting that the traditional press was wrong, or doing a superficial job. 
This chart might help get traditional media loyalists to consider that reporting isn't what it used to be

Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce … Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living. And just as they seem to be occupied with revolutionizing themselves and things, creating something that did not exist before, precisely in such epochs of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service, borrowing from them names, battle slogans, and costumes in order to present this new scene in world history in time-honored disguise and borrowed language. Thus Luther put on the mask of the Apostle Paul, the Revolution of 1789 – 1814 draped itself alternately in the guise of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and the Revolution of 1848 knew nothing better to do than to parody, now 1789, now the revolutionary tradition of 1793-95. 
If you ever wondered where that quote came from, now you know! A fine example from the 2016 election is commentators comparing Clinton to Lincoln.

NFIB Small Business Optimism Index, October 2016: 'The small business optimism index rose 0.8 points in October to 94.9, slightly exceeding expectations and extending a rebound from the 2-year low at 92.6 set in April' [ Econoday ]. 'A net 25 percent of owners reported raising worker compensation, a 3 point increase from September. Capital outlays, a leading strength of the index recently and important for future growth, remained at a strong 27 percent, the second highest reading of the recovery.' But the NFIB's press release says: 'Small business owners are rattled by uncertainty and unable to decide whether to expand, whether to hire, or whether to make other important decisions that might boost the economy' [ Econoday ]. And: 'the highest level this year' [ Calculated Risk ]. 
JOLTS, September 2016: 'Job openings rose to 5.486 million in September, up from a revised 5.453 million in August but still on the low side of this year's trend. Hires are down in the September data, to 5.081 million from August's 5.268 million to suggest that employers are having a hard time filling slots' [ Econoday ]. 'With it hard to find the right person for the right job, employers are holding onto their existing employees closely as the layoff rate fell… [I'm so old I remember when you could get training at your job! Good times….] Though hiring is down, these numbers nevertheless will confirm worries that wage inflation may be approaching, that employers will have to offer more to bring in the workers they need.' Time to screw the workers take away the punch bowl, Janet! And: 'The data overall suggests that there was a slight cooling in the labour market during the third quarter, but not enough to discourage a December rate increase from the Federal Reserve' [ Economic Calendar ]. And: '[A]nother solid report' [ Calculated Risk ].

There had, however, been some tightening of conditions on Commercial Real Estate (CRE) loans' [ Economic Calendar ]. And: 'Bank credit tends to tighten up as the economy slows, which slows lending and makes matters worse.The buzz word is 'pro cyclical'' [ Mosler Economics ].

'Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund agreed to pay $2.7 billion for P3 Logistics Parks and its portfolio of European warehouses… in one of the biggest real-estate deals in Europe this year. The high returns on the industrial properties are a big draw, but the bigger attraction over the long term is the growing need for space to serve e-commerce customers in a European market with a limited number of high-quality warehouses. This is the second big buy in logistics for Singapore's GIC Pte. fund, which bought the Blackstone Group LP's IndCor Properties and its network of U.S. warehouses. The upheaval in the market likely isn't over—another Blackstone property, Logicor, is exploring either an outright sale or an initial public offering of a business that owns 660 warehouses in 18 European countries.' 
Shipping: 'The top U.S. maritime regulator [Federal Maritime Commission Chairman Mario Cordero] says the ongoing consolidation in the shipping industry isn't leading to collusion to fix freight rates' [ Wall Street Journal ]. Of course not. That's the purpose of setting up a ginormous cartel, right? 
Shipping: 'The Port of Oakland said today its October export volumes reached a three-year high, increasing 20 percent over 2015 levels and posting the fourth-largest monthly total in its history' [ DC Velocity ]. 'Port executives said that export volumes benefitted from weakness in the U.S. dollar that made U.S. exports more competitive in world markets and a strong agricultural harvest. Oakland is the closet seaport to the verdant growing areas of the Central, Napa, and Salinas valleys, and as a result handles much of the state's agricultural export cargo. The port reported that containerized import cargo volume increased 2 percent in October. Overall loaded container volume—imports and exports—was up 11.4 percent, the port said.' 
Shipping: '[UPS] is buying medical-logistics specialist Marken Ltd., pushing deeper into the highly specialized and very profitable business of healthcare industry deliveries. The move is a play for high-yield business when many traditional industrial and retail customers are opting for slower, cheaper shipping….Closely-held Marken specializes in transporting clinical trial materials and medicine between 49,000 clinical trial locations around the world, work that is particularly sensitive in terms of time and temperature' [ Wall Street Journal ]. 'For UPS, it also delivers a bigger entry into a growing market, particularly as aging populations in the developed world spend more on health care and clinical research expands.' 
Shipping: 'Packaging machinery shipments in U.S. could reach $8.5 billion in 2020' [ DC Velocity ] '[T]he fastest-growing machinery types scored by CAGR through 2020 will be the labeling, decorating, and coding (3.9 percent) and the case handling (2.5 percent) machinery groups. That rapid growth is largely a result of new legislation demanding increased labeling and coding, continuing developments in printing technologies, and the proliferation of SKUs, PMMI said. The other machinery groups include: filling and dosing; bottling line; form, fill, and seal; cartoning; palletizing; closing; and wrapping and bundling.'

The demolition activity in the last three months surprised BIMCO [Baltic and International Maritime Council] positively and it exceeded our initial expectation based on the appalling 2015 demolition activity,' said Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst, BIMCO. 'The advance is a push in the right direction, as demolition activity is one of the essential measures needed to be taken to rebalance the container shipping industry.'''Rebalance.'

Retail: 'Panjiva Research Director Chris Rogers told Logistics Management that when specifically looking at import numbers for things like apparel, especially winter clothing, and toys, which are both down, it suggests that retailers are not feeling 'hugely confident' about the state of consumer spending. And he added that it is in direct contrast to recent data issued by the National Retail Federation, which is calling for holiday shipping season (the months of November and December) to be up 3.6 percent' [ Modern Materials Handling ]. From October. But still. 
Retail: 'A recent survey of shoppers weighed in with their answer to the question, 'Do you like Black Friday?' Only 14.7% said that they love it, while 50.7% said it was okay. More than a third — 35.3% — said they hated it. A rather staggering 85% of those surveyed either hated Black Friday or didn't care much about it' [ 247 Wall Street ] ( original survey ). Throw me in the 'hate' bucket! 
Housing: 'It is so interesting to once again see the 'drive until you qualify' meme permeating the housing industry. People seem to think this is now a new permanent plateau, a new normal, yet ignore the low home ownership rate and the reality that momentum is turning. But of course many are not paying attention – they are stuck in traffic apparently. Mega commutes, rental Armageddon, and insane prices for crap shacks are all part of the game today' [ Dr. Housing Bubble ]. 'If you look at the rise in these mega commutes in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley it shot up in 2010… Something fundamentally shifted here. Of course you have your house humpers saying that this is great and somehow reflects a healthy market but in reality, it simply shows a hyper manic market of people desperate to claw into a crap shack. And many are now having to endure Clockwork Orange like torture in traffic. Many Millennials are simply saying no and are renting closer to work (or living at home with parents).' 
Honey for the Bears: 'The restaurant recession has arrived' [ MarketWatch ]. 'One factor is pressure on discretionary income from the rising costs of staples such as rent, medicine and education. Then there's the steady rise in the cost of eating out, which has come just as grocery bills are getting cheaper. The cost of food purchased for home use—that is, groceries—has fallen 2.4% in the past year, government data showed in October. That's the biggest decline over a 12-month period since the end of the Great Recession in 2009… Food costs have shrunk because of a global glut in farm products such as wheat, rice, soy and corn. Then there's the effect of U.S. producers increasing the size of egg-laying chicken flocks and cattle herds, which has helped bring down the cost of eggs, beef and milk—egg prices alone have tumbled a staggering 50% in the last year.'

Here's the timing: 
Most of the US will have to wait for polling stations to close – typically between 19:00 EST (00:00 GMT) and 20:00 EST (01:00 GMT) – for state projections. 
As for the final result? Stay glued to your phone or TV or set your alarm for 23:00 EST (04:00 GMT). That's when West Coast polls close and history suggests a winner's declared. It was bang on the hour in 2008, and 15 minutes later in 2012. 
Of course, if you go further back in history, 2004 was a nailbiter. I remember very well going to bed after the Kerry campaign said they'd challenge the result based on Ohio, and getting up in the morning to find out they'd caved. And of course election 2000 was what it was. 
There will be many sites tracking the results as they come in; here's Politico's for the presidency (they also have the House and the Senate). It's impossible to know which one is the best until data actually appears; I prefer maps with results as they come in by county. And speaking of counties… 
The final RCP averages put Clinton ahead in the national popular vote by 3.3%. However, with Trump ahead in Florida (0.02%), North Carolina (1%), and Clinton only ahead by 0.5% in New Hampshire, it still looks like a horse race, to me. (Of course, I may have become counter-suggestible to the idea that Clinton has it in the bag because almost the entire political class is yammering that she does.) 
Anyhow, if indeed this is a horse race — and if our famously free press doesn't simply decide to call it — we'll be up late waiting for county data in the states that are close (presumably swing states like Florida, North Carolina, and New Hampshire). So here is a table of the counties that various sources regard as key:

Normally when we think of 'free trade,' us lay people, we think of removing barriers to the exchange of goods and services. Removing barriers is the 'free' part of 'free trade.'

Consider, for example, a flea market held in the parking lot of a local fairground on a Saturday. To participate, you have to register for a space with the organizers (the parking lot isn't infinitely long or wide), set up an approved tent or table, and usually, if your goods are sold by weight or volume, have your weights and measuring devices certified by the organizers as honest. 
All of the restrictions above place limits on the 'market' — put it under control of the organizers — but consider for a minute just the last one, certified weights and measures. How is that not 'picking winners and losers'? Winners — Vendors with honest scales. Losers — Vendors who cheat their customers. 
Or consider a flea market without that requirement. Winners — Vendors who cheat their customers. Losers — Vendors with honest scales. 
A lot has been written, in fact, about the non-existence, by definition , of anything resembling a 'free market,' including much by the writer Masaccio (main site here ). 
Monopolies and 'Free Trade' 
But that point aside, let's consider TPP from another standpoint. Monopolies are the enemies of so-called 'free trade' since, by definition, they destroy competition and invert the usual assumptions about pricing power. In a well-supplied market, a market with much available product, pricing power is with the buyers, the customers, since it is they who, in the aggregate, set the limits of 'what the market will bear.' 
But in a market in which the supply of something essential for life — water, food, life-saving medical supplies and care, even apartment housing in an old-style 'company town' — is not 'well-supplied,' but is instead controlled and constrained by a single supplier or a small cartel of non-competing suppliers, that's just the opposite of a 'free market.' It's in fact the least free a market can get. 
Thus it is with TPP. Very little actual trade will be freed up if TPP is passed, since barriers to 'trade' among the many of the potential signing nations are nearly non-existent. 
On the other hand, one of the most important outcomes of theTPP will be the destruction of a competitive market, the one for life-saving drugs and other 'intellecual property.' For these products, the TPP raises barriers as surely as tariffs would do. 
Economist Dean Baker calls the TPP a 'protectionist' agreement. Baker (my emphasis): 
The TPP And Free Trade: Time To Retake The English Language 
The proponents of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) are planning to do a full court press in the lame duck session of Congress following the election. We will be bombarded with speeches and columns from President Obama and other illustrious figures telling us how it is important to approve the TPP for a variety of reasons. 
We can be certain that one of the reasons will be the inherent virtues of free trade. They will not be telling the truth. 
The TPP is not about free trade . It does little to reduce tariffs and quotas for the simple reason that these barriers are already very low. In fact, the United States already has trade deals with six of the other eleven countries in the TPP. This is why the non-partisan United States International Trade Commission (ITC) estimated that when the full gains from the TPP are realized in 2032, they will come to just 0.23 percent of GDP. This is a bit more than a normal month's growth. 
Again, the full gains from the TPP will come to just 0.23% of GDP — one month's growth. So what is going on with the TPP? Why do people like Barack Obama (and Pfizer, etc.) want it to pass so badly? Among the reasons is this one: 
[T]he TPP goes far in the opposite direction, increasing protectionism in the form of stronger and longer patent and copyright protection . These forms of protection for prescription drugs, software, and other products, often raise the price by a factor of a hundred or more above the free market price. This makes them equivalent to tariffs of several thousand percent. 
These forms of protection do serve a purpose in promoting innovation and creative work, but we have other more efficient mechanisms to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, the fact that they serve a purpose doesn't mean they are not protectionist. 
Tilting the playing field toward Money, a scheme that protects the holders of intellectual property … forever, if they can get away with it. For example, consider this: 
Copyright Length And The Life Of Mickey Mouse 
Last week, we reported on Rep. Zoe Lofgren's statement that copyright law has become equal to the life of Mickey Mouse . Tom Bell has a couple of recent posts exploring issues related to Mickey Mouse and copyright, that seem worth exploring, given Rep. Lofgren's recognition of this fact. While he notes (as we have) that there's ample evidence to suggest that the earliest Mickey Mouse cartoons really are in the public domain , he first explores how the length of copyright has followed the age of Mickey Mouse : 
Bottom line: Until the current, neo-liberal capital-protecting political regime falls or is taken over, Mickey Mouse will never be in the public domain. 
What About a 'Free Market' for Doctors Too? 
Baker finds something else significant about our so-called 'free trade' agreements — they're very selective about which markets are 'freed.' Consider, for example, the market for relatively powerless manufacturing labor and the market for much more powerful (and wealthy) doctors. 
Baker: 
The other point to be made about free trade and protectionism is that our push for free trade has always been very selective. NAFTA and other trade deals were explicitly designed to make it as easy as possible for U.S. corporations to manufacture goods in the developing world and ship them back to the United States. … 
But [while] manufacturing workers in the developing world are willing to work for much lower pay than manufacturing workers in the United States, so are doctors in the developing world . 
Unlike manufacturing workers, doctors are powerful enough to get protection. It is not generally possible for a doctor trained in another country to practice medicine in the United States unless they pass a U.S. residency program — for which there is a strict quota on foreign trained students. As a result of this restriction, doctors in the United States earn on average twice as much as doctors in Canada, Germany, and other wealthy countries . This protectionism costs the United States roughly $100 billion a year (around $700 per family) in higher health care costs. 
If our trade negotiators actually were interested in 'free trade,' they would have constructed a system whereby foreign trained doctors could be certified as meeting U.S. standards. They would then have the same freedom to practice as any doctor born and trained in the United States. 
Again, a straight-up wealth protection scheme. Baker goes on to note that the 'market for doctors' really is a trade issue, not an immigration one, since many German, Canadian, French and Indian doctors could most like get into the U.S. and get jobs — as waiters, for example — they just couldn't work as doctors. 
Baker's conclusion is exactly right, that calling a deal like the TPP a 'free trade agreement' is just propaganda: 'When reporters call the TPP a ‘free trade' deal, they are acting as advocates, not reporters. The TPP is a protectionist pact for those at the top who are worried that free trade will undermine their income — like it did for those at the middle and bottom.' 
There's No 'Free Market' for Political Parties Either 
I think if Democrats think that the Trumpist revolt against 'free trade' deals is just an expression of anti-immigrant racism — and that they can pass TPP in the lame duck session without consequences — there may be a surprise in store for them. After all, there's no 'free market' for U.S. political parties either — we have a carefully protected two-party monopoly — and there are only two ways to disrupt and revolt against it that I can think of. Neither is pretty, neither is orderly, and neither will be good for Democrats. 
Forewarned? Let's hope so. The lame duck session is just weeks away. 0 0 0 0 0 0

by Yves Smith 
By Bill Black, the author of The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One and an associate professor of economics and law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Jointly published at New Economic Perspectives 
I am writing this article late on election night in my office at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, about a mile from the home in which Tom Frank grew up just over the state line in Kansas. Beginning with his famous book, What's the Matter with Kansas , first published in 2004, Tom Frank has been warning the Democratic Party of the increasing cost it was paying by abandoning and even attacking the working class, particularly the white working class. Some political scientists tried to savage his work, pointing to Bill Clinton's electoral success and arguing that the disaffected members of the working class were also less likely to vote. Frank returned to the theme just in time for this election with a new book – Listen, Liberal – that documents in damning, lively narrative the New Democrats' war on the New Deal, their disdain for organized labor, and their antipathy for what they viewed as retrograde white working class attitudes. 
Frank kept showing the enormous price the working class were paying as a result of the economic policies of the Republicans and the New Democrats, and the indifference to their plight by the leaders of the New Democrats. Senator Bernie Sanders consciously took up the cause of reducing surging inequality and became a hero to a broad coalition of voters, many of them fiercely opposed to the New Democrats' embrace of Wall Street cash, policies, and arrogance. Sanders set records for small donor fundraising and generated enormous enthusiasm. Sanders knew he would face the opposition of the New Democrats, but he also found that progressive congressional Democrats would rarely support him publicly in the contest for the Party's nomination and even union leaders sided overwhelmingly with Secretary Hillary Clinton, the New Democrats' strongly preferred candidate. 
Hillary did not simply fail to reach out to the working class voters that the New Democrats had turned their backs on for decades, she infamously attacked them as 'deplorables.' This was exactly the group of potential voters that was enraged because it believed, correctly as Tom Frank keeps showing us, that the New Democrats looked down on them and adopted policies that rigged the system against the working class. Hillary's insult confirmed their most powerful bases for their rage against her. Her insult was an early Christmas present to Trump. Her attempt to walk the insult back was doomed. 
Hillary Clinton handled things so miserably that she allowed a plutocrat whose career is based on rigging the system against the working class to become the hero of the working class. That is world-class incompetence. Had she followed Tom Frank's advice she would today be the President-elect. The real cost, however, of her failure will be enormous damage to our democracy, the safety of the world, and the damage that President Trump will do to the working class as he systematically betrays their interests. 
The first test of whether the Wall Street-wing of the Democratic Party has learned any of the lessons Tom Frank tried to teach them is whether President Obama will continue with his threat to try to have the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) approved by the lame duck session of Congress. Obama, who was elected on the promise that he would stop TPP, should listen to Senators Sanders and Warren and honor his promise to the voters to stop TPP. He must begin the process of the Democrats winning back the support of the working class. 
The leaders of the democratic-wing of the Democratic Party need to move forward assertively to retake control of their Party. The current head of the DNC has been exposed as part of the effort to prevent Senator Sanders from winning the nomination. She should resign tomorrow. The Clintons should cease acting as Party leaders. 
A period of enormous corruption and elite fraud is coming soon as the Trump administration brings its signature characteristic – crony capitalism – to bear to control all three branches of government. Trump promises to deregulate Wall Street, appoint top supervisors chosen for their unwillingness to supervise, and appoint judges who will allow CEOs to loot with impunity. Trump promises to outdo even the savage anti-media and anti-whistleblower policies of the Obama administration. The House and Senate committee chairs will intensify their blatantly partisan use of investigations while refusing to conduct real oversight hearings revealing the elite fraud and corruption. 
The progressive Senate Democrats will have to be innovative and stalwart in these circumstances to find ways to blow the whistle repeatedly on the mounting corruption. Their challenge will be to lead despite having no real institutional power. Democrats should start by doing what they should have done in 2004 – take Tom Frank's warnings deadly seriously. 0 0 0 0 0 0

It's really amazing to see how little of the blame is going to Clinton herself. It was her decision to set-up a private email server. It was her decision to serve as Secretary of State while accepting millions from foreign governments. It was her decision to get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars while unofficially running for President. It was her decision to call millions of Americans deplorable. 
We have very little idea of what a Trump presidency will amount to. My best guess has been that he will be a Jimmy Carter cubed in Berlusconi packaging. 
Recall that even though Carter has been the best former President of the modern era, he came to Washington as an outsider with his Georgia team. Despite having ben a governor and thus knowing how to draft legislation and get bills passed, he famously got little accomplished despite having a Democratic party majority in the House and Senate. 
Trump is likely to spend his first year, and conceivably his entire Presidency, with all of the Democratic party and enough of the Republican party against him to stymie him, fighting for the right to govern. And that assumes he has an agenda beyond the very few goals he has articulated consistently: getting out of 'bad' trade deals and entering into better ones; reducing immigration and deporting many undocumented immigrants (and building his famed wall); investing heavily in infrastructure; making NATO members pay their share of its budget (the theoretical level, 2% of each nation's GDP, is largely footed by the US); cutting back our involvement in overseas conflicts; cutting taxes; and repealing Obamacare. 
The only initiatives where the Republicans might back him solidly are cutting taxes and ending Obamacare, and even then, given the lobbying power of Big Pharma and the health insurers, the Republicans might not be as willing to pull the trigger on Obamacare as all their kvetching would lead you to believe. 
There is one more Trump campaign promise that will serve as an important early test of his seriousness as well as his survival skills: investigating Clinton. Even if Obama pardons her, as our Jerri-Lynn Scofield has predicted, it will be critical for Trump to carry out a probe of the Clinton Foundation's business while Clinton was Secretary of State. 
If Trump is to cut the cancer of the neocons out of the policy establishment, he has to have them on the run. It is a reasonable surmise that Clinton's enthusiasm for war was due at least in part to heavy Saudi support of the Foundation. Showing that American's escalation in the Middle East, which Obama tried with mixed success to temper, was due in part, and perhaps almost entirely, to the personal corruption of the Secretary of State, would keep the hawks at bay, particularly if other prominent insiders and pundits were implicated in Clinton Foundation influence-peddaling. 
It will be hard for Trump to do much to alter the course of the military-surveilance complex unless he can hamstring the warmongers. Just as Warren has argued relative to bank regulations, 'personnel is policy.' If Trump is a fast learner, he'll see that that is just as true on the foreign policy front. 
Finally, those on the left need to turn the blame cannon aimed squarely at them back on the professional hacks who are truly responsible. Despite their tiresome chest-beating about meritocracy, these Acela corridor bubble-dwellers are constitutionally incapable of holding their fellow club member accountable. Their preening self regard repelled hard-working Americans who'd done the right thing, as in gotten an education, and if they were older, launched a career, bought a house and started a family, only to struggle harder and harder while seeing any vestige of security and hope of improved living standards erode. And unless they were at the top of the professional classes, they felt defeated by not being able to pay for their kids to go to college and being uncertain as to how to advise them with their educations and job prospects. 
The Democrats under Clinton and Obama abdicated the duty of the elites, which is to improve the conditions for, or at least limit harm to, the members of the communities they lead. Even Bill Clinton did remember that the most important duty for a Democrat is to create jobs, even if he did so by presiding over a rise in household debt and a stock market bubble. 
Young people, who poll well to the left of their elders, have inferred a lesson that the labor movement forgot: the exercise of power includes being willing to inflict punishment in the form of withholding support. Look at how diminished organized labor has become by casting its lot with the feckless Dems who've sold them out again and again. Hillary tried the Clinton 'They have no where to go' trick one time too many, kicking the left after she only narrowly beat Sanders. And the left decided to return the favor. She made clear she has no intention of representing them. They heard her message loud and clear and acted accordingly. 
As reader aab : 
The big question to me is, take over the hollow shell of the Democratic Party, or crush it with a new party. Is it possible to take over the Ds — as weak as it is now as a party — without being corrupted and co-opted? I now hate my former party to such a degree, I find myself recoiling at having anything at all to do with it. But given all the institutional constraints, it still may be smart to try; the answer is above my pay grade, as they say. 
This is an important question to consider as we see how the Democratic party responds to this well-deserved defeat. 0 2 0 0 0 0

Tesco Bank cyber raid 'unprecedented', says financial regulator Guardian (Bill B) 
2016. A big round of applause for Lambert and those of you who participated in our live blog last evening and into the AM.

Yves here. Even though this post is a bit wonky, it's short and very important. And you need to read about something other than the election. Recall that Angus Deaton is the winner of the Swedish-National-Bank-named-for-Albert-Nobel prize and with Anne Case, performed an important study that exposed the spike in death rates among less-educated middle aged whites . 
By Nancy Cartwright, Professor of Philosophy, University of Durham and University of California, San Diego and Angus Deaton, Senior Scholar and Dwight D. Eisenhower Professor of Economics and International Affairs Emeritus, Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and Economics Department, Princeton University. Originally published at VoxEU 
In recent years, the use of randomised controlled trials has spread from labour market and welfare programme evaluation to other areas of economics (and to other social sciences), perhaps most prominently in development and health economics. This column argues that some of the popularity of such trials rests on misunderstandings about what they are capable of accomplishing, and cautions against simple extrapolations from trials to other contexts. 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been sporadically used in economic research since the negative income tax experiments between 1968 and 1980 (see Wise and Hausman 1985), and have been regularly used since then to evaluate labour market and welfare programmes (Manski and Garfinkel 1992, Gueron and Rolston 2013). In recent years, they have spread widely in economics (and in other social sciences), perhaps most prominently in development and health economics. The 'credibility revolution' in econometrics (Angrist and Pischke 2010) putatively frees empirical investigation from implausible and arbitrary theoretical and statistical assumptions, and RCTs are seen as the most 'credible' and 'rigorous' of the credible methods; indeed, credible non-RCT designs typically pattern themselves as closely as possible on RCTs. Imbens (2010) writes, 'Randomised experiments do occupy a special place in the hierarchy of evidence, namely at the very top.' 
In medicine, Pocock and Elbourne (2000) argue that only RCTs 'can provide a reliably unbiased estimate of treatment effects', and without such estimates, they 'see considerable dangers to clinical research and even to the well-being of patients'. The link between bias and risk to patients is taken as obvious, with no attempt to show that an RCT experimental design does indeed minimise the expected harm to patients. The World Bank has run many development related RCTs, and makes claims well beyond unbiasedness. Its implementation manual states, 'we can be very confident that our estimated average impact' (given as the difference in means between the treatment and control group) 'constitute the true impact of the program, since by construction we have eliminated all observed and unobserved factors that might otherwise plausibly explain the differences in outcomes' (Gertler et al. 2011). High-quality evidence indeed; the truth is surely the ultimate in credibility. What Are Randomised Controlled Trials Food For? 
In a recent paper, we argue that some of the popularity of RCTs, among the public as well as some practitioners, rests on misunderstandings about what they are capable of accomplishing (Deaton and Cartwright 2016). Well-conducted RCTs could provide unbiased estimates of the average treatment effect (ATE) in the study population, provided no relevant differences between treatment and control are introduced post randomisation, which blinding of subjects, investigators, data collectors, and analysts serves to diminish. Unbiasedness says that, if we were to repeat the trial many times, we would be right on average. Yet we are almost never in such a situation, and with only one trial (as is virtually always the case) unbiasedness does nothing to prevent our single estimate from being very far away from the truth. If, as if often believed, randomisation were to guarantee that the treatment and control groups are identical except for the treatment, then indeed, we would have a precise – indeed exact – estimate of the ATE. But randomisation does nothing of the kind, even at baseline; in any given RCT, nothing ensures that other causal factors are balanced across the groups at the point of randomisation. Investigators often test for balance on observable covariates, but unless the randomisation device is faulty, or people systematically break their assignment, the null hypothesis underlying the test is true by construction, so that the test is not informative and should not be carried out. 
Of course, we know that the ATE from an RCT is only an estimate, not the infallible truth, and like other estimates, it has a standard error. If appropriately computed, the standard error of the estimated ATE can give an indication of the importance of other factors. As was understood by Fisher from the very first agricultural trials, randomisation, while doing nothing to guarantee balance on omitted factors, gives us a method for assessing their importance. Yet even here there are pitfalls. The t-statistics for estimated ATEs from RCTs do not in general follow the t-distribution. As recently documented by Young (2016), a large fraction of published studies have made spurious inferences because of this Fisher-Behrens problem, or because of the failure to deal appropriately with multiple-hypothesis testing. Although most of the published literature is problematic, these issues can be addressed by improvements in technique. Not so, however, in cases where individual treatment effects are skewed – as in healthcare experiments, where a one or two individuals can account for a large share of spending (this was true in the Rand Health Experiment); or in microfinance, where a few subjects make money and most do not (where the t-distribution again breaks down). Once again, inferences are likely to be wrong, but here there is no clear fix. When there are outlying individual treatment effects, the estimate depends on whether the outliers are assigned to treatments or controls, causing massive reductions in the effective sample size. Trimming of outliers would fix the statistical problem, but only at the price of destroying the economic problem; for example, in healthcare, it is precisely the few outliers that make or break a programme. In view of these difficulties, we suspect that a large fraction of the published results of RCTs in development and health economics are unreliable. 
The 'credibility' of RCTs comes from their ability to get answers without the use of potentially contentious prior information about structure, such as specifying other causal factors or detailing the mechanisms through which they operate. A sceptical lay audience is often unwilling to accept prior economic knowledge and even within the profession, there are differences about appropriate assumptions or controls. Yet, as is always the case, the only route to precision is through prior information and controlling for factors that are likely to be important, just as in a (non-randomised) laboratory experiment in physics, biology, or even economics, scientists seek accurate measurement by controlling for known confounders. Cumulative science happens when new results are built on top of old ones – or undermine them – and RCTs, with their refusal to use prior science, make this very difficult. And any RCT can be challenged ex post by examining the differences between treatments and controls as actually allocated, and showing that arguably important factors were unevenly distributed; prior information is excluded by randomisation, but reappears in the interpretation of the results. 
A well-conducted RCT can yield a credible estimate of an ATE in one specific population, namely the 'study population' from which the treatments and controls were selected. Sometimes this is enough; if we are doing a post hoc program evaluation, if we are testing a hypothesis that is supposed to be generally true, if we want to demonstrate that the treatment can work somewhere, or if the study population is a randomly drawn sample from the population of interest whose ATE we are trying to measure. Yet the study population is often not the population that we are interested in, especially if subjects must volunteer to be in the experiment and have their own reasons for participating or not. A famous early example comes from Ashenfelter (1981), who found that people who volunteer for a training programme tend to have seen a recent drop in their wages; similarly, people who take a drug may be those who have failed other forms of therapy. Indeed, many of the differences in results between experimental and non-experimental studies can be traced not to differences in methodology, but to differences in the populations to which they apply. The 'Transportation' Problem 
More generally, demonstrating that a treatment works in one situation is exceedingly weak evidence that it will work in the same way elsewhere; this is the 'transportation' problem: what does it take to allow us to use the results in new contexts, whether policy contexts or in the development of theory? It can only be addressed by using previous knowledge and understanding, i.e. by interpreting the RCT within some structure, the structure that, somewhat paradoxically, the RCT gets its credibility from refusing to use. If we want to go from an RCT to policy, we need to build a bridge from the RCT to the policy. No matter how rigorous or careful the RCT, if the bridge is built by a hand-waving simile that the policy context is somehow similar to the experimental context, the rigor in the trial does nothing to support a policy; in any chain of evidence, it is the weakest link that determines the overall strength of the claim, not the strongest. Using the results of an RCT cannot simply be a matter of simple extrapolation from the experiment to another context. Causal effects depend on the settings in which they are derived, and often depend on factors that might be constant within the experimental setting but different elsewhere. Even the direction of causality can depend on the context. We have a better chance of transporting results if we recognise the issue when designing the experiment – which itself requires the commitment to some kind of structure – and try to investigate the effects of the factors that are likely to vary elsewhere. Without a structure, without an understanding of why the effects work, we not only cannot transport, but we cannot begin to do welfare economics; just because an intervention works, and because the investigator thinks the intervention makes people better off, is no guarantee that it actually does so. Without knowing why things happen and why people do things, we run the risk of worthless casual ('fairy story') causal theorising, and we have given up on one of the central tasks of economics.

The Democrat establishment was warned about their weak candidate, and they were presented with a popular and well-funded alternative: Bernie Sanders. Instead, as the Podesta emails show in lavish detail, they used their control of the party machinery and their service providers in our famously free press to rig the election in their favor at every turn. When their candidate was nominated, the Democrat establishment tacked right, and proceeded to explain to Sanders voters that their voters were not needed because, as #BernieBros, they were racist and sexist. Sanders supporters have every right to say #WeWereRight and #WeToldYouSo. 
If this were Japan, we'd be seeing Democrat Party leaders committing seppuku, or cutting off their little fingers or — supposing them not to be gangsters — ritually and tearfully bowing to the people they betrayed.

'In a special positive, wholesale inventories of autos fell 1.7 percent in a draw, based on last week's very strong results for October vehicle sales, that will have to be rebuilt. The risk that inventories may be too high are a key concern for the economic outlook, specifically that high levels of unwanted inventories could slow fourth-quarter production and employment growth.'

'However, the headline wage growth tracker is a three month moving average of each month's median wage growth.

'How has the recent slowdown in U.S. investment affected U.S. imports? The next chart shows that U.S. capital goods imports are very highly correlated with equipment investment—a category that excludes intangibles, residential investment, and changes in inventories. Equipment investment has been unusually weak, with its four-quarter percentage change falling into negative territory, which is unusual outside a recession period. These data suggest that the slowdown in import growth likely stems from whatever is behind the weakness in equipment, rather than from trade-specific factors such as trade policies or higher trade costs.' Well, we do have a capitalist economy…

If the question is when markets will recover, a first-pass answer is never' [Paul Krugman, New York Times ]. Sure, 'first pass' is faux Nobel-worthy weasel wording. But come on. 
Political Risk: 'Dow Makes Miraculous 1,000 Point Recovery From Trump-Fueled Overnight Lows' [ ETF.com ]. 'The most short-lived major market crash of all time ended as quickly as currency manipulator' [ Politico ]. 'Even if congressional Republicans demonstrated the will and actually managed to approve the TPP in the lame-duck session that begins Monday, the chances of which appear next to nil with Trump headed to the White House, the president-elect would not implement the 12-nation pact, University of California-Irvine Professor Peter Navarro, a Trump adviser, told Politico in August. That makes the Trump presidency the worst-case scenario for the Obama administration and other trade proponents who have been clinging to the hope that the Asia-Pacific pact could pass before the end of this year.' Sad! 
''I think the TPP is dead, and there will be blood all over the floor if somebody tries to move that through the Congress any time soon,' Sessions said. 'Both candidates opposed it, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump'' [ Observer ].

The Rending of Garments and Gnashing of Teeth 
'An American Tragedy' [David Remnik, The New Yorker (2:40AM). 'That the electorate has, in its plurality, decided to live in Trump's world of vanity, hate, arrogance, untruth, and recklessness, his disdain for democratic norms, is a fact that will lead, inevitably, to all manner of national decline and suffering.' Notice the flaccidity of the language: 'democratic norms'; 'all manner of'; 'a fact… that will lead to.' Remnik really needs an editor. Sad. 
'Homeless in America' [Thomas Friedman, New York Times ]. 'How do I explain Trump's victory? Way too soon to say for sure, but my gut tells me that it has much less to do with trade or income gaps and much more to do with culture and many Americans' feeling of 'homelessness.'' And then Friedman spirals off into abstractions about the 'feelings' people have when they lose their homes, while somehow omitting to mention the fact that millions of Americans literally lost their homes in a foreclosure crisis caused by scamming banksters Obama never brought to justice, and who, if they were foolish enough to enter Obama's 'foam the runway' HAMP program, were further screwed. 
'Americans are not and have never been united by blood or creed, but by allegiance to a democratic system of government that shares power, cherishes the rule of law and respects the dignity of individuals. We hope our newly elected president will show respect for that system. Americans must stand ready to support him if he does, and to support the system whether he does or does not' [Editorial Board, WaPo ]. Would that any of those things were true. Perhaps for the individuals on WaPo's editorial board, they are. 
'Political scientists have long recognized that most ordinary citizens have only a tenuous grasp of 'the presuppositions and complex obligations of democracy, the rights it grants and the self-restraints it imposes.' Thus, political elites 'serve as the major repositories of the public conscience,' if anyone does' [Larry Bartels, New York Times ]. I've always wondered why the Democrats never really work to extent the franchise. Here at least we have the ideological justification. 
'Today the world has seen the end of two centuries of Anglo-Saxon dominance – a hundred years of Britain, from the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 to the Battle of the Somme, and a hundred years of the United States, ending today, with the election as president of the US of a fascist 'television personality' married to a nude model' [ Splash 247 ]. ''Decadence' is the term that we need, here – decadence on a scale not seen in the world since the fall of the Roman Empire – which fell in much the same way, for much the same reasons.' 
We have now seen a hat trick of 'democratic' events in which men who come from the elite, and who have betrayed their class – Roderigo Duterte, in the Philippines, on May 9, was the straw in the wind, he was followed by Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage in the UK, on June 23, and today by Donald Trump in the US, and they have, with the use of the internet social media, most especially Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook, successfully suckered the soggy mass of lazy, ill-educated, ill-read and ill-informed proles, and a good supply of what V.I. Lenin called 'useful idiots', in three nations, into putting them into power, by telling lies and by promising the proles what they want. 
What the proles want is 'good jobs' but with the ability to buy the stuff they buy now at cheap prices, because it is made by under paid, hardworking, men and women in other countries who have 'stolen their jobs', and they want 'no foreigners'. They can't have this, of course, but no matter, they don't read, they just look at 'memes', and the damage is done. 
Leave it to the Brits to work in the class angle, quote Lenin, and toss in an Orwell reference! 
'Trump voters will not like what happens next' [Garrison Keillor, WaPo ]. 'America is still the land where the waitress' kids can grow up to become physicists and novelists and pediatricians, but it helps a lot if the waitress and her husband encourage good habits and the ambition to use your God-given talents and the kids aren't plugged into electronics day and night.' Help me. 
'Americans have done a very dangerous thing this week. Because of what they have done we all face dark, uncertain and fearful times' [ Guardian ]. 
''Dear God, America what have you done?': How the world and its media reacted as Donald Trump became US President-elect' [ Telegraph ]. A nice round-up of front page images. 
Policy 
'Trump won largely because people couldn't bring themselves to vote for Clinton, and not so much because anyone like him or his presumed agenda. And along the way he destroyed the Republican party, which may or may not sit so well with Republicans in Congress' [ Mosler Economics] . 'So it's not like he has a mandate to do anything or that he can rely on Republican support for anything.' I'm not so sure; I see the Republican primary and the general taken together a repudiation of both party establishments and the political class in its totality. That said, this is important: 
Regarding his proposed tax cuts, under current law bills can't be introduced in Congress unless they are 'paid for', so, for example, to introduce a tax cut it has to be paid for by spending cuts. Yes, Congress could change the law or override it but that would require Senate approval, and that takes a 60% majority that Republicans don't have. 
So my point is that at best it's going to take a very long time to get anything done. And the way all the charts are decelerating it could all get pretty ugly waiting for the kind of fiscal adjustment needed to reverse course. 
'The new Senate's Republican majority will remain short of the 60 votes needed for a full repeal. But Congress demonstrated in the past year that it could use the upper chamber's reconciliation process — requiring just 50 votes — to send a bill undoing major ACA elements to the White House. Last winter, President Obama vetoed that legislation' [ WaPo ]. Meaning, of course, that the Democrats could have done exactly the same thing in 2009, but passed HR676 or SB703. That, throwing a bankster or two in jail, and a decent stimulus package instead of the one Larry Summers deked Obama into approving, and the Democrats might control all three branches of government today. And so it goes. 
The Voters 
'As of 11:55 a.m. ET, Clinton had amassed 59,458,295 votes nationally, to Trump's 59,265,380 — a margin of 192,915 that puts Clinton on track to become the fifth U.S. presidential candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election' [ NPR ]. But the first woman!

Originally published at the Tax Justice Network 
This blog comes from Johannesburg, South Africa, where investigative journalists from 28 countries are sharing their work at the African Investigative Journalism Conference . One session looked at stories dug out from the Panama Papers leak from offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca and investigations which have revealed a colourful mix of characters involved in looting Africa. 
The stories uncovered include a mafia lawyer linked to the film The French Connection , an absentee landowning Russian oligarch , plus, of course, a former politician , and a 'millionaire receptionist' who denies knowledge of having owned nine offshore companies registered in the British Virgin Islands. 
The common factor in all these stories is the role of offshore secrecy jurisdictions populated by western banks, western lawyers, western accounting firms, and protected by leading western nations like the United Kingdom, which even as I write is vigorously trying to protect its Crown Dependencies from attempts to crack down on offshore secrecy . 
Unsurprisingly the British Virgin Islands – a British overseas territory – feature heavily, as does Switzerland . 
The story of the 'millionaire receptionist' Letitia Diergaardt, covered by The Namibian newspaper, provides fascinating insights into the duplicity of offshore secrecy. Diergaardt works as a receptionist/clerk in Windhoek, Namibia. Yet according to The Namibian she technically owns or owned nine offshore companies registered in the British Virgin Islands. However, as The Namibian reports, she denies all knowledge of owning these companies, which were registered in the BVI between 13th and 25th April 2007. 
Apparently unknown to her, Diergaardt's identity was used to provide a nominee shareholder for all nine companies. As The Namibian dryly notes: 'on face value, the use of her name in these companies is to represent hidden owners . . ' 
Secretive shell companies are a core part of the secrecy jurisdiction offer. They provide immunity from criminal investigation and prosecution. They are the 'get-out-of-jail-free' card for crooks and their enablers. Secretive shell companies allow nominee owners to front for those known as the 'ultimate beneficial owners', as The Namibian comments: 
'The secretive offshore industry relies on a network of individuals whose names are used on official records as directors, company secretaries and shareholders. Often, the real owners who call the shots remain invisible, hiding behind dummy directors, who are only owners of these companies on paper.' 
Yet despite all the evidence of abuse of offshore companies registered in Road Town, the British Virgin Islands government persists in blocking moves to make a registry of ultimate beneficial ownership available to public scrutiny. In Jersey, another British tax haven, the authorities refuse to make company ownership information available to investigative journalists by claiming that a public registry would 'lead to fraud and cybercrime.' 
Let's be frank. For all their pious words about wanting to crack down on corrupt practices, western governments remain deeply implicated in facilitating the looting of Africa . 
As Shinovene Immanuel from The Namibian told this blogger earlier today: 
'The West must help Africa by locking the doors through which the money flows, and the West must also pull up their socks to make these offshore companies more transparent. If Western countries want to help developing countries, they must stop standing in the way of investigating corrupt business practices.' 0 0 0 0 0 0

Yves here. This is a very important video from the Real News Network , and I wish there were a transcript, so do take the trouble to listen to it. 
One of the reasons for the ferocity of the howling from the Democratic Party hackocracy in the wake of the unexpected Trump vicory is that they are effectively cornered animals. As political scientist Tom Ferguson explains, the Democrats can't get the number of voters they need with their traditional coalition of Big Finance money plus identity politics without delivering tangible benefits to workers, which they have abjectly failed to do. But the power of mone in the Democratic party makes it well nigh impossible for them to devise the sort of populist policies that would appeal to voters that Trump has successfully peeled off. 
Ferguson also has some important exit poll and early, granular data that debunks some cherished Democratic party myths. For instance, playing the gender card wasn't as successful as the media would lead you to believe. 
Ferguson, who has been a consistent critic of the Democrats from the left, does not rule out the idea that Trump could deliver on policies that would make him popular, most important, ones that would create more jobs and improve wages. One expert close to the Sanders camp came to the same view separately months ago. So while Trump may be stymied, or may never have been sincere about his battle call to downtrodden workers, it's a mistake to rule out the possibility that he will continue to succeed despite the odds and his glaring character defects. 0 0 0 0 0 1

Repeal Would Be Even Worse Than Obamacare Bloomberg. From the McMuffin. I not entirely convinced, the reason being that the answers to general questions are not the same as of those directed to people who are buying policies and looking at prices and choices and see that they suck. Put it another way: one more year of death spiral, of 25%+ or more price increases and even narrower networks (which McArdle ignores as de facto denial of coverage by design of many pre-exsiting conditions via exclusion of the required specialists) and more people will recognize that the supposed advantages of Obamacare are empty for many people. The other way would be for the Republicans to engage in a period of concerted messaging about the failure of Obamacare to deliver on the two features that McArdle flags as popular. But they haven't been terribly good at anything other than very simple messaging, like 'Obamacare! Democratic and socialized! Bad Obamacare!' (witness Benghazi). But to her point, it would be better to have a replacement, like what Obamacare really is: catastrophic coverage, presented as such. And Trump did say he's get rid of Obamacare and put something better in place, not simply scupper it.

TPP/TTIP/TISA/NAFTA 
'[Trump] has many tools to reverse the post World War II consensus on liberalizing U.S. trade without needing congressional approval. For instance, he can withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, as he has threatened to do, by simply notifying the U.S.' Nafta partners, Mexico and Canada, and waiting six months. Withdrawing from the World Trade Organization, which sets rules for global trading and enforces tariffs, has a similar provision' [ Wall Street Journal , 'Donald Trump Will Need to Leverage Size, Power of U.S. Economy to Remake Global Trading System']. ''Our major trading partners are far more likely to cooperate with an America resolute about balancing its trade than they are likely to provoke a trade war,' wrote Trump economic advisers Peter Navarro [ here ] of the University of California-Irvine and investor Wilbur Ross in September. 'This is true for one very simple reason: America's major trading partners are far more dependent on American markets than America is on their markets.'' 
TPP: 'To take effect, TPP must be ratified by February 2018 by at least six countries that account for 85 percent of the 12 members' aggregate economic output. This effectively means that the U.S. and Japan, the world's third-largest economy and the second-largest that is a signatory nation, must both be on board' [ DC Velocity ]. 
TPP: 'Mr. Trump's win also seals the fate of President Barack Obama's 12-nation trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. The president-elect blamed the TPP on special interests who want to 'rape' the country' [ Wall Street Journal , 'Donald Trump Win to Upend Trade Policy']. 'Mr. Obama had hoped to work with Republican lawmakers to pass the TPP during the 'lame duck' session of Congress after the election, where they faced an uphill battle even if Tuesday's vote had favored Hillary Clinton, who previously backed the TPP negotiations. Now Republicans have little incentive to bring the TPP to a vote, since Mr. Trump could easily threaten to unravel the deal when he takes office and block its implementation, as well as punish lawmakers who vote for it.' 
TPP: 'Donald Trump's historic victory Tuesday has killed any chance of Congress voting on President Barack Obama's signature Asia-Pacific trade agreement while raising the odds of a damaging trade confrontation with China — just two ways a Trump presidency could upend the global trading system and usher in a new era of U.S. protectionism, analysts say' [ Politico ]. ''This is the end of globalization is we knew it … because what the U.S. is going to do is certainly going to impact other countries' and their decisions on negotiations,' Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Politico. 'TPP is now in the history dustbin for sure,' Hufbauer said.' 
TPP: 'House GOP election outcomes will be key as House Speaker Paul Ryan decides whether to bring the TPP to a vote in the lame-duck session with GOP voters strongly against and the GOP 's high-donor base demanding action. With an eye to conservative GOP threats to withhold support for his speakership and a possible 2020 presidential run, Ryan's decision is complicated. Whether the TPP will get a lame-duck vote is his call. Beyond whether he can muster the votes of representatives who weathered the wrath of trade voters in this cycle and worry about the 2018 primaries lies the longer-term implications of his even trying to do so with the GOP voter base so intensely against the pact' [Lori Wallach, Eyes on Trade ].

The Rending of Garments and Gnashing of Teeth 
'People's net worth has been crippled, if you were directly, in a 401K, through a mutual fund, or through a pension, invested in capital markets' [TeacherKen, Daily Kos ]. Bathos. 
Money 
'Allies on the ground complained for weeks that they weren't getting the resources they needed' [ The Hill ]. ''The big question is 'How much money did you spend? And what's left in the bank?' said one Clinton surrogate. 'Because there were states like Michigan that kept sounding the alarm and no one was taking it seriously until the very end. They never really got everything they wanted.'…'Russ Feingold sent a flare up and said 'I need help,' [Democratic strategist Jim Manley] said, but it went largely ignored.' Huh? Clinton spent the month of August fundraising. The Clinton Victory Fund scam turned the state parties into a money laundries for cash passed through to the Clinton campaign. Clinton raised $154 million in September for her campaign and the party. And people 'getting the resources they needed'? Seems odd. 
Policy 
'Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled the Senate would move swiftly to repeal Obamacare now that the GOP Congress will have a Republican president next year' [ Politico ]. 
Polling Debacle 
'While the [Trump] campaign had expressed confidence in public, their own data showed only a narrow path to the 270 electorates needed to win the White House' [ NBC ]. And: 'RNC staffers thought Trump would win 240 Electoral College votes, 30 short of the 270 needed to win. They cautioned reporters that these numbers could change. And it was noteworthy that their projections were more optimistic than much of the public polling. But Trump was down 2 points in Florida, down 2 points in Iowa, down 2 points in New Hampshire and down 3 points in Wisconsin. Trump won Florida, won Iowa, won Wisconsin, and as of the publishing of this story was in a tight race for New Hampshire' [ Yahoo News ]. Which, interestingly, is what I kept saying. When I cut through the triumphalism and looked at the polling, and threw those numbers against the 'paths to victory,' it was always (except for one week) a horse race. So I seem to have channeled the Trump team's thinking on the data. It's been an interesting year, and I'll critique my approach tomorrow. An interesting data point: 'The best data inside the Trump campaign was just as pessimistic. Even the most optimistic models run by Cambridge Analytica for Trump showed him losing. But as Cambridge's Matt Oczkowski tweeted late Tuesday, Trump's support and turnout among rural voters was 10 percentage points higher than they had expected .' Ten points is rather a lot. 
'Donald Trump's win was predicted by Allan Lichtman — the US election expert who has called every result since 1984' [ Independent ]. ''[The 13 keys method] is a historically based prediction system. I derived the system by looking at every American presidential election from 1860 to 1980,' Professor Lichtman has said.' And: 'Lichtman believes election analysts err by studying campaign as a series of battlefields — northern versus southern Florida, western versus eastern Pennsylvania, and so on. He prefers likening it to dominoes, toppling one way or the other. He says U.S. campaigns are contests of momentum. In the early 1980s, he and a colleague examined election results dating back to the Civil War and found a pattern. They drew up 13 true-false statements, and if the answer to six or more was 'False,' the incumbent party always lost the White House' [ HuffPo ]. And: 'LICHTMAN: I don't call [the 13 keys] data-driven. I have no problem with data. My prediction system is based on a huge amount of data, you know. But I do object to poll-and-pundit-driven analysis, which is not meaningful because it's not based on any kind of systematic assessment of how elections work' [ NPR ]. 
'I Answer Your Questions About Predicting President Trump' [ Scott Adams Blog ]. 'Clinton's team of cognitive scientists and professional persuaders did a terrific job of framing Trump as scary. The illusion will wear off – albeit slowly – as you observe Trump going about the job of President and taking it seriously. You can expect him to adjust his tone and language going forward. You can expect foreign leaders to say they can work with him. You can expect him to focus on unifying an exhausted and nervous country. And you can expect him to succeed in doing so. (He's persuasive.) Watch as Trump turns to healing. You're going to be surprised how well he does it. But give it time.' Scott Adams is looking pretty good right now. But is he only as good as his last trade? 
'Silver is just guessing. And, in the run-up to this election, he made so many guesses that at least one of them has to be correct' [ WaPo ].

'The 2018 election cycle has started and Republicans find themselves in an interesting place. On the one hand, the tables are turned as they will get to play offense. There are 33 races in 2018 and Democrats will defend 25 of those seats while Republicans will defend just eight of them' [ Cook Political Report ]. 
The Voters 
Anecdotes but well-chosen: 'It was never enough to say that the Trump phenomenon rested only on whites without a college degree. They were part of Trump's surprise, but not all of it. The real shocks were the fence-sitters, the late-breakers, the Bush-family types, and the suburban women. They would, we were so often told, recoil from Trump. Outside the Silverbrook Elementary School, a polling station in the affluent community of Fairfax Station, I encountered Jaclyn Miller, a genial tax accountant in her mid-thirties. I asked how she voted. She winced and laughed. 'I voted for Trump, begrudgingly,' she said' [ The New Yorker ]. ''It was the lesser of two evils, in my mind. I'm definitely a fiscal conservative, and the corruption and everything from Hillary, just, I couldn't do it,' she said. 'She's not trustworthy.' The 'Access Hollywood' tape did not matter much to her. After all, she said, Bill Clinton was 'with an intern in the Oval Office.; Of Trump, she added, 'I'm sure there's things that I've said that I would never want public.' Miller went on, 'A couple weeks ago, I had decided, at that moment, that I was going third party. And I really wish that there was a valid third-party option. I think a lot of Americans don't fall into one category.'' Amen to that last comment. 
'The Democratic Party Deserved To Die' [Krystal Ball, HuffPo ]. 'Well, those jobs are actually gone for good, we knowingly told them. And we offered a fantastical non-solution. We will retrain you for good jobs! Never mind that these 'good jobs' didn't exist in East Kentucky or Cleveland. And as a final insult, we lectured a struggling people watching their kids die of drug overdoses about their white privilege. Can you blame them for calling bullshit? ' 
'The 'Deplorables' Got the Last Laugh' [David Dayen, The New Republic ]. '[T]he lesson for Democrats is ultimately clear enough: You cannot write off half the country, much less spend an election cycle deriding it, and expect success.' 
'Despite the unexpected triumph of Donald Trump, Democratic state legislative candidates held their own Tuesday in their efforts to close the gap on Republicans in the nation's statehouses' [ RealClearPolitics ]. But: 'Overall, after netting more than 800 state legislative seats during the Obama years, Republicans are hugely dominant in the nation's statehouses, controlling 66 of the nation's 98 partisan legislative chambers. Democrats control 30. There are two ties, pending the outcome in the New York Senate. (Nebraska has a nominally non-partisan unicameral legislature.) ' 
Our Famously Free Press 
'But I've come to think that the rise of fake news — and of the cheap-to-run, ideologically driven aggregator sites that are only a few steps up from fake — has weaponized those filter bubbles. There were just too many people voting in this election because they were infuriated by made-up things they read online' [ Nieman Labs ]. Dunno about that (see below). But this rings true: 'One thread running through the countless profiles of Trump voters this cycle was the loss of community institutions. The factories shut down; the church pews were emptier than they used to be; the braided fabric of their towns had unraveled. Don't forget that, particularly in smaller communities, the local newspaper was one of those key institutions — the daily or weekly package of stories that connected you to your neighbors.' 
'Facebook's algorithm and whatever 'echo chamber' or 'filter bubble' or whatever it may have created did not lead to this result. This was the result of a very large group of people who are quite clearly — and reasonably — pissed off at the status quo…. This was a 'throw the bums out' vote, and many of the bums deserved to be thrown out' [ Tech Dirt ]. 'But that's not Facebook's fault. And the idea that a better or different algorithm on Facebook would have made the results any different is just as ridiculous as the idea that newspaper endorsements or 'fact checking' mattered one bit. People are angry because the system has failed them in many, many ways, and it's not because they're idiots who believed all the fake news Facebook pushed on them (even if some of them did believe it). Many people don't think Trump will be any good, but they voted for him anyway, because the status quo is broken.' 
Legitimacy 
Trump meets with Obama: ''We discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties. I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel,' Trump said. 'Mr. President, it was a great honor meeting with you. And I look forward to meeting with you many, many more times in the future'' [Olivier Knox, Yahoo News ]. 
Sanders: 'To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him. To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic, and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him' [ Variety ]. 
'Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg appeared to be wearing her infamous 'dissent jabot' on the bench Wednesday morning. The move is being widely interpreted as a repudiation of Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election a night earlier' [ The Hill ]. 'Ginsburg typically wears the collar when issuing dissenting opinions in the court, as she explained to Yahoo News in 2014. But no opinions were read Wednesday.' This isn't like Kremlinology. It is Kremlinology. 
'The audience for our glib analysis and contempt for much of the electorate, it turned out, was rather limited. This was particularly true when it came to voters, the ones who turned out by the millions to deliver not only a rebuke to the political system but also the people who cover it. Trump knew what he was doing when he invited his crowds to jeer and hiss the reporters covering him. They hate us, and have for some time' [ CBS ]. 'What's worse, we don't make much of an effort to really understand, and with too few exceptions, treat the economic grievances of Middle America like they're some sort of punchline. Sometimes quite literally so, such as when reporters tweet out a photo of racist-looking Trump supporters and jokingly suggest that they must be upset about free trade or low wages.' Yglesias being a prime offender. 
'My mom-in-law was watching CBS all night, so that's what we watched. All the pundits/anchors spoke in the hushed tones of a funeral. For two hours, the only images of campaign workers shown were the sad faces of Clinton supporters; not one image of jubilant Trump supporters was broadcast until Trump gave his acceptance speech' [ Of Two Minds ]. 'When one of the talking heads noted that Hillary never generated the enthusiasm of the Sanders or Trump campaigns, his comment was followed by a stony silence. That he had given voice to a self-evident truth was not welcome. 
'The White House on Wednesday refused to rule out the possibility that Obama would pardon Clinton to prevent Trump from prosecuting her when he takes office' [ The Hill ]. And: ''There are deep and disturbing issues there,' [Rudy] Giuliani, a top Donald Trump adviser and former federal prosecutor, said Thursday on Fox News's 'Fox & Friends,' citing the Clinton Foundation. 'That's why I don't think President Obama should pardon her,' Giuliani added. 'I think President Obama should leave it to the system that we all believe in to determine is she innocent or is she guilty?'' 
'Within a few weeks of winning the White House, President-elect Donald Trump could face another group of U.S. citizens, a federal jury in California, courtesy of a lawsuit by former students of his now-defunct Trump University who claim they were defrauded by a series of real-estate seminars' [ Reuters ].

The Bezzle: '̌Republican Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential race puts a new rule on retirement advice in limbo, even after Wall Street's biggest wealth management firms have spent millions preparing for it, lawyers and analysts said this week. The U.S. Department of Labor fiduciary rule, which is set to start taking effect in April, is meant to promote the best interests of retirement savers by eliminating conflicts of interest for brokers' [ Reuters ]. 'On the campaign trail, Trump has said that '70 percent of regulations can go,' and an adviser, Anthony Scaramucci [ here ], told Reuters the fiduciary rule 'would likely be stopped.'' 
The Bezzle: 'We decided to examine the descriptions of [thousands of companies that received venture capital investment since 2010] to get a better look into the ever-changing startup landscape. We used natural language processing to identify trends by looking at which words are more or less common today than at the beginning of the decade' [ Priceonomics ]. 'We found that social media, mobile apps, and email startups are on their way out, while messaging, healthcare, tools, and artificial intelligence are gaining momentum. By and large, startup descriptions are tech-heavy, featuring words like 'app,''cloud,' and 'network.' Our data also shows that no word has seen a bigger jump in usage than 'virtual reality' and no word a bigger decline than 'electronics.''

'The betting in Mr. Trump's camp is that trading partners will believe that access to the U.S. market is too precious to give up without negotiating new deals. Until that happens, however, ocean carriers will have to watch the political winds.'

'Sex is far from a perfect way to reproduce. It imposes a huge cost on a species, and that cost is called 'males.' If roughly 50 percent of a species is made up of males who are incapable of producing babies, it is at a serious reproductive disadvantage relative to another species made up mostly of females capable of reproducing on their own' [ Nautilus ]. 'Despite its drawbacks, sex does seem to offer a species an incontrovertible advantage. It recombines individuals' genes so that the species as a whole can maintain the diversity of traits it needs to survive whatever challenges—faster predators, changing climate, giant comet impacts—the future may throw at it…. By this logic, parthenogenesis is an evolutionary cul-de-sac.' But: 'Earlier this year, a team from the American Museum of Natural History compared easily measurable traits such as scales along the belly, or pores on the right leg, from seven generations of one line of parthenogenic whiptails with a sexually reproducing species. The parthenogens showed just as much physical variability as sexually reproducing whiptails, even though the parthenogens all had identical DNA.' Hoo boy.

By Jerri-Lynn Scofield, who has worked as a securities lawyer and a derivatives trader. She now spends most of her time in India and other parts of Asia researching a book about textile artisans. She also writes regularly about legal, political economy, and regulatory topics for various consulting clients and publications, as well as writes occasional travel pieces for The National . 
The biggest story on Indian television yesterday wasn't the election of Donald Trump. For on Tuesday night (IST), Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a surprise speech declared that currency notes of rupees (Rs) 500 and Rs 1000 — the highest two denominations in circulation– would be invalid as of midnight that same night. The withdrawn notes could no longer be used for transacting business or as a store of value for future usage (with some limited exceptions, but even these were only allowed for a short transition period). 
From Modi's speech : 
'There is a need for a decisive war against the menace of corruption, black money and terrorism… Corruption, black money and terrorism are festering wounds which make the country hollow from within,' he said, adding such activities hold back the nation's progress. 
Describing illegal financial activities as the 'biggest blot', Modi said that despite several steps taken by his government over the last two-and-a-half years, India's global ranking on corruption had moved only to 76th position from 100th earlier. 
'This shows the extent of the web of corruption in the country. The disease of corruption is the domain of some veted people who are flourishing. Some people have misused their positions and benefitted. On the other hand, honest people are suffering,' he said. 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)– the Indian central bank– as reported by The Times of India , elaborated: 
The incidence of fake Indian currency notes in higher denomination has increased. For ordinary persons, the fake notes look similar to genuine notes, even though no security feature has been copied. The fake notes are used for antinational and illegal activities. High denomination notes have been misused by terrorists and for hoarding black money. India remains a cash based economy hence the circulation of Fake Indian Currency Notes continues to be a menace. In order to contain the rising incidence of fake notes and black money, the scheme to withdraw has been introduced. 
Chaos Ensues 
India remains a cash-based economy, especially for low-value transactions, and the move has caused widespread chaos, as I write this from Kolkata where I am currently visiting. The move was accompanied by a temporary shut down of all banks and ATMs, with banks reopening earlier today and ATMs due to reopen tomorrow. 
Initially, after the announcement, the highest denomination legal tender note in circulation was the Rs 100 note. New legally tender Rs 500 and Rs 2000 notes have been made available today, according to Tushar Roy, chief manager of a nationalized bank, Central Bank of India. Not all banks have yet received the new notes, but Roy says that this problem is expected to be resolved soon. The government also expects to re-introduce Rs 1000 notes soon, to include advanced security features. When ATMs open tomorrow, withdrawals will be limited to a maximum of Rs 2000 per transaction, as compared to the Rs 10,000 and in some cases, Rs 15,000 limits, that previously applied. 
Starting today, after producing appropriate identification, people are allowed to exchange old notes for new at any of the 19 RBI offices, any bank branch, or at any head post office or sub-post office. They will have until December 30 to complete their transactions. 
Individuals receive full value for the entire volume of bank notes tendered at any of these venues, but here's the kicker: At the moment, each person is limited to receiving only Rs 4000 per person in cash irrespective of the size of tender. Anything over and above that amount can only be credited to a bank account. This allows the government to track whether the sums tendered have been legitimately acquired. Withdrawals from bank accounts will be limited to Rs 10,000 a day and Rs 20,000 a week. The government has announced this part of the policy may be relaxed in future, says Roy, in order for employers, for example, to meet payrolls currently made in cash. (Ultimately the government wants more transactions to be paid via bank accounts, so that they can be tracked and taxed appropriately). 
Does The Policy Make Sense? 
It's beyond the scope of this post to speculate on the impact the new policy will have on individuals of various occupations and with myriad reasons for transacting in large amounts of cash. For more on this point, interested readers might wish to look at this article in The Wire . 
Some have criticized the policy for focusing on currency alone, and have noted that black money is typically not held by Indians in stacks of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, but in one of two alternative ways. 
The very rich store black assets in offshore accounts (as detailed in, among other sources, the Panama Papers). 
But tax evasion and corruption is not limited to the very richest alone. In India, many doctors and other professionals, members of the business community, and small traders also underreport their taxable income. They tend to hold their black assets on-shore, within India, in the form of real estate, art work, gold bullion, jewellery, or securities. 
Unlike other current policy areas– border incursions into Pakistan, for example– the political opposition has has not contested the objective of the Modi move. There is virtually unanimous concurrence– at least publicly– on cracking down on black money. Yet as The Hindu reported, former Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram has criticized the Modi government's method for achieving its objective: 
'We support the objective of the government to stamp out black money. But the method they have adopted raises questions… The move has come as a bolt from the blue for the common man.' 
The real test for the government would begin [Thursday], Mr Chidambaram said. 'How efficiently and how quickly the money is exchanged…. If there is harassment or inconvenience and all kinds of questions are asked, then I think that will be completely counterproductive.' 
A similar move had been contemplated by the previous Congress-led UPA government, he recalled. But the idea was dropped as 'the economic gains were not too great.' 
Mr. Chidambaram said the introduction of the new series of notes was estimated to cost Rs. 15,000 crores to Rs 20,000 crores [Jerri-Lynn here: a crore is 10,000,000 in the Indian numbering system]. 'The economic gains of demonetisation should be at least equal to that amount.' 
If the additional tax revenue pulled in by the Modi move is less than that amount, the new policy will actually have ended up costing the government money– rather than increasing government revenues. 
As Chidambaram summarized (again from The Hindu article quoted above): 
The 'economic wisdom' of the government's decision, Mr Chidambaram said, would be tested on three parameters: a) the present cash to GDP ratio is 12 per cent. Will it come down to the world average of about 4 per cent? b) The value of the high denomination notes currently in circulation is about 15 lakh crore rupees [Jerri-Lynn here: a lakh is 100,000, a crore, 10,000,000, so a lakh crore is 1,000,000,000,000.] Will that value come down significantly? c) Will gold imports surge, indicating that unaccounted income/ wealth is seeking refuge in bullion and gold jewellery? 
Various economists have also presented other criticisms of the government's move, as reported by The Wire. Requiring a switch to new bank notes means Indians must take time to switch their existing Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes into the new bank notes. If new notes are not freely and widely available, this will freeze trade and the normal functioning of an exchange economy. Further, many Indians receive salaries in cash and do not have bank accounts at present, so requiring transactions to pass through the banking system will cause them considerable immediate inconvenience. 
Impact on Economic Activity 
But there is a wider reason for critiquing the policy. 'Black money and not paying taxes: These are bad things in a society,' says Suvojit Bagchi, Kolkata bureau chief for The Hindu. 'Not surprisingly, everyone– including the opposition– agrees on the objective of cracking down on black money.' Increasing the tax base- is the prime objective here. But will the demonetization policy produce substantial tax revenue? Bagchi noted that Chidambaram questioned whether taxes raised would be sufficient to recoup the cost of printing new bank notes. 
Another objective, Bagchi added, is to move India away from its reliance on cash, toward a more American or European plastic system, where it's easier to track– and tax– money. 
And finally, at least half of Indian economic activity occurs in the informal sector, which is not tightly controlled. Bagchi gave the example of a building promoter, whose building activity produces both black and white revenues. Indeed, perhaps 40% of the promoter's overall activity, he estimated, might be black activity. But that black activity also generates employment, as well as other knock on effects. While the government hopes that its policy will increase the tax base, it's also possible that demonetization might instead lead to the shut down of at least some black activity. 'So, the government's latest move may actually slow economic activity considerably,' Bagchi says, 'But for how long, and to what extent, no one knows.' 
He further added, 'At the moment, the Indian economy is somewhat insulated from the world economy, in part due to its reliance on cash and the existence of considerable black activity. Once India moves to a plastic system, and cuts back on that black activity, it will lose some of this insulation.' 
As reported in The Wire , Abhijit Sen, former member of the Planning Commission, is also concerned about contraction in the informal sector: 
The sudden decision to demonetise currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 is targeted to reduce illicit stocks of black money and fake currency. This has a clear rationale if such notes are used mainly to stock undisclosed wealth, rather than for transactions. However, RBI data show that currency notes of these two denominations make up over 80% of the total currency in circulation. Therefore, unless a very large proportion of money in circulation lies permanently as stocks, the demonetisation can also be expected to have a significant immediate effect on that part of the economy which relies mainly on cash transactions. 
The size of India's cash economy is not exactly known but, given the large proportion of workers in informal sectors, it is unlikely to be less than half the total economy. We can, therefore, expect an immediate contraction of this part of the economy in the next two days and with the effect stretching over a longer period of time, although diminishing over time. Whatever its long-term positive effects, those depending on cash whether for daily wages or as payments for goods or services they sell are likely to be in for tough times in the coming days. In the long term as well, all that this does is partially eliminate some black money stocks without undoing the processes that lead to black money creation.

Massachusetts +11% New York +10% 
When home prices rise for years, foreclosure filings become rare because defaulting homeowners can usually sell the home for more than they owe and pay off the mortgage. The problem arises when home prices fail to rise locally, and it balloons when home prices fall. We've seen that last time around. After bouncing along super low levels during Housing Bubble 1 through 2005, foreclosure filings skyrocketed during the housing crash starting in 2006. At first it was just an uptick that no one paid attention to. By 2008, it helped take down the financial system. 
Foreclosure filings peaked in late 2009, began dropping in 2010, and then tapered down to 2006 levels as foreclosures were processed, and as the home price surge of Housing Bubble 2 made new defaults less likely. But the spike in October stands out as much as those in the early phases of the housing bust in 2006 and 2007. Note the blue bar on the right : 

While some states are still trying to digest the foreclosures from the last housing crisis, according to Daren Blomquist, senior VP at ATTOM, 'the foreclosure activity increases in states such as Arizona, Colorado and Georgia are more heavily tied to loans originated since 2009 ': 
'The loans used in this housing recovery that appear to be most susceptible to foreclosure are those such as FHA and VA with low down payments. Our data shows FHA and VA loans combined represent 49% of all active foreclosure inventory for loans originated in the seven years ending in 2015.' 
This chart shows the soaring proportion of FHA and VA mortgages issued since 2009 among the active foreclosure inventory. 

On average across the nation, the foreclosure rate was one foreclosure filing for every 1,258 housing units. But in some states, the foreclosure rate was much worse. Here are the 'top' ten: Delaware: one in every 355 housing units New Jersey: one in every 564 housing units Maryland: one in every 679 housing units Illinois: one in every 704 housing units South Carolina: one in every 801 housing units Nevada: one in every 826 housing units Florida: one in every 895 housing Ohio: one in every 930 housing units Pennsylvania: one in every 1,018 housing units Georgia: one in every 1,028 housing units. 
And here are the 'top' ten highest foreclosure rates among the 216 metropolitan areas with a population of over 200,000: York-Hanover, PA: one in every 274 housing units Atlantic City, NJ: one in every 301 housing units Rockford, IL: one in every 481 housing units Columbia, SC: one in every 498 housing units Trenton, NJ: one in every 499 housing units. Reading, PA: one in every 542 housing units Chicago, IL: one in every 571 housing units Dayton, OH: one in every 573 housing units Philadelphia, PA: one in every 597 housing units Salisbury, MD: one in every 625 housing units. 
These 'foreclosure filings' are based on data that ATTOM gathered in 2,200 counties where over 90% of the US population lives. They include data on the three phases of foreclosure: Foreclosure starts: lender issues Notice of Default (NOD) and Lis Pendens (LIS) Auction notices for future public foreclosure auctions: Notice of Trustee's Sale (NTS) and Notice of Foreclosure Sale (NFS); Real Estate Owned (REO) properties that have been foreclosed on and were repurchased by a bank at auction and are now held by the bank. 
Broken down based on these three phases of the foreclosure process: 
Foreclosure starts jumped 25% in October from the prior month, to 43,352. While still down 11% year-over-year, it was the highest monthly increase in foreclosure starts since December 2008. 
Foreclosure starts increased even year-over-year in 23 states and Washington D.C. In some states they soared. The 'top' five: Colorado +71%

Donald Trump's victory could ultimately lead to a lot more oil pipelines moving forward, one sector of the fossil fuel industry specifically targeted by environmentalists. 
The most controversial project right now, the Dakota Access Pipeline, received a jolt from Tuesday's result. The more than 1,100-mile pipeline, valued at $3.7 billion, would carry oil from North Dakota to refineries in Illinois. The Obama administration has requested a temporary halt to construction, although the company behind the project, Energy Transfer Partners, has pressed forward, ignoring the Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps reiterated a request for a stoppage this week, but the outcome is up in the air. 
The Dakota Access Pipeline has been reeling from protests, work stoppages, bad press and a federal government willing to listen to the grievances from the Native American community affected. Trump has shown little inclination of being as accommodating, so the Dakota Access Pipeline has gone from being a project on the ropes to one with a great deal of momentum. Unless the Corps rescinds a permit in the next few months, the project will move forward. Even if it is blocked, however, it would likely be revived under a Trump administration. Energy Transfer Partners' stock price surged as much as 9 percent on Wednesday and was up more than 3 percent on Thursday. The company hopes to complete construction by the first quarter of 2017. 
And Dakota Access' predecessor, at least in terms of a national flashpoint, could also be coming back from the dead. TransCanada issued a statement on Wednesday, telegraphing the company's interest in reviving the defunct Keystone XL Pipeline, which would take Alberta tar sands to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. 'TransCanada remains fully committed to building Keystone XL,' spokesman Mark Cooper said in the post-election statement. 'We are evaluating ways to engage the new administration on the benefits, the jobs and the tax revenues this project brings to the table.' TransCanada's stock price jumped more than 2 percent on Wednesday. 
During the campaign Trump said that he supported the pipeline, but wanted the U.S. to get a 'better deal.' His words are often conflicting and contradictory – he has also said that he is for an 'America First' energy plan that would remove 'all barriers to responsible energy production.' So there is no reason to think that he wouldn't simply revive the project as is, especially given that he is surrounding himself with advisors from the oil and gas industry. 
Beyond these two projects, the oil industry is hoping for broader easing of permitting and regulations on pipeline construction. The Army Corps under Trump could clear the way for energy infrastructure, downgrading its scrutiny of the effects on rivers and lakes from oil pipelines. 'We're hopeful the pipeline approval process will now be allowed to work without political interference,' John Stoody, vice president of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, told E&E News. And with plans to dismantle much of the EPA, the ability to break ground and lay down pipeline could get a whole lot easier. 
While Trump supports the Keystone XL Pipeline, his presidency complicates things for Canada a bit. For one, he wants to renegotiate NAFTA. But leaving that aside, the resuscitation of Keystone XL could create problems for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was thought to be nearing an approval for the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion, which would take Alberta oil to the Pacific Coast. It is not obvious that both the Keystone XL Pipeline and Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain Pipeline both need to be built.

Alberta's Premier is not ready to put all her eggs in one basket by trusting that the pathway to Canada's south for oil will be cleared up. 'We must continue to work to diversity Canada's energy markets, and to build trading relationships with more than one buyer,' Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said in a statement following Trump's victory. 'For that reason, a Canadian pipeline to tidewater remains an important priority for Alberta.' 
Finally, the environmental movement has been left shocked and terrified over what a Trump administration would mean for the environment, but they have vowed not to give an inch. 'I think they will greenlight lots of fossil fuel projects,' Jane Kleeb, a key activist fighting the Keystone XL Pipeline in Nebraska, told E&E News . 'And we'll fight all of them.' 0 0 0 0 0 0

The euro as a common currency has recently been the subject of harsh criticism by economists from both sides of the Atlantic, including claims that citizens in some Eurozone countries are turning against the it. This column argues that, in fact, the euro currently enjoys comfortable popular support in each of the 12 original member states of the Eurozone and that potential upcoming referenda in any of these countries do not appear to pose a threat to the currency. In contrast, popular support for the euro has declined sharply in non-Eurozone EU member states since the recent crisis, with the UK standing out as the country with the most negative view. 
Recently the euro as a common currency has been the subject of strong criticism by economists from both sides of the Atlantic (e.g. Stiglitz 2016, Sinn 2014). This criticism has been inspired by the financial and economic crisis in some Eurozone countries and by the slow recovery in the region after the Global Crisis of 2008. Scholars claim that a majority of citizens have turned against the euro in large member states of the Eurozone, such as Germany (Stiglitz 2016: 314) and Italy (Guiso et al. 2016: 292, Sinn in Kaiser 2016a). 
In the wake of the vote for Brexit in the UK referendum in June this year, it is argued that knock-on effects in the form of potential upcoming referenda on the euro in the Eurozone (e.g. in Italy) might lead to its break-up (Feldstein 2016, Stiglitz in Martin 2016, Stiglitz in Kaiser 2016b). In addition, it has been postulated that animosity amongst EU member states is at a high (Alesina 2015: 78). This suggests a rising threat to the European project, including the common currency. 
These claims concerning the standing of the euro raise the question: How does the public in EU member states actually look upon the common currency at this stage? We are able to provide an answer based on survey data on the popularity of the single currency, which are available from its creation, as polled by TNS-opinion (European Commission 2016). These data are provided through the Eurobarometer (EB). The euro is a unique currency in the sense that similar time series evidence does not exist for any other currency. 
Our answer draws upon our previous contribution to this site (Roth et al. 2012), where we explored Eurobarometer survey data on public support for the common currency from 1990 to 2012. There we concluded that in the first four years of the crisis (2008-2012), public support for the euro declined only marginally. Now the question is: What has happened in the most recent years regarding public support for the euro? 
Support for the Common Currency Within the Original Eurozone 
We present an up-to-date picture of the evolution of public support for the euro until May 2016, adopting our approach in Roth et al. (2016). First, we focus on the original 12 Eurozone member states (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain – the EZ12) that adopted the euro as a physical entity in January 2002. Figure 1 shows average net support (in per cent) for the single currency in the EZ12 countries over a 27-year period from 1990 to 2016. 
Figure 1 Average net support (in %) for the single currency in the EZ12 countries, 1990-2016 

Note : The y-axis displays net support in percent. Since the figure depicts net-support, all values above 0 indicate that a majority of the respondents support the single currency. The dashed lines distinguish the introduction of the euro as a book keeping entity in January 1999, the actual circulation of the euro in January 2002 and the start of the financial crisis in September 2008. Data for EB45 were not available. Population-weights are applied. Net-support is measured as the number of 'For' responses minus 'Against' responses and is constructed according to the equation: Net-support = (For – Against)/(For + Against + Don't Know). Source : Figure 1 is an updated version of Figure 1 until 5/2016 (by EB's 82-85) in Roth et al. (2016; 948). 
Figure 1 leads us to the following conclusions: Over the 27-year time period, a majority of citizens within the EZ12 has supported the single currency (with average net support exceeding 15% at all times). Since the introduction of the euro in 1999, a large majority of EZ12 citizens has supported the euro (with average net support exceeding 30%). In the 8th year (in May 2016) since the start of the financial crisis, average net support of 42% has surpassed the pre-crisis level of 40% in March-May 2008. 
Figure 1 gives the aggregate picture. How has support for the euro evolved in the individual members of the EZ12? Figure 2 provides an answer. 
Figure 2 Net support for the single currency in EZ12 countries, 1990-2016 (%) 

Source : Figure 2 is an updated version of Figure A1 until 5/2016 (by EB's 82-85) in Roth et al. (2016: 957). 
Figure 2 suggests that: Since the introduction of the euro in 1999, aside from short periods in Finland and Greece before the crisis, a majority of citizens in each member state of the EZ12 supported the euro, even in times of crisis. From 2008 to 2016, significant increases in support in Greece, Portugal and Germany (26, 23 and 10 percentage points, respectively) have levelled out the fall in net support in other EZ12 countries, ranging from 11 percentage points in Ireland to 5 percentage points in Finland. Over the 27-year time period (1990-2016), Italy has always had a pro-euro majority, with the minimum net level of 17% in November 2013, clearly above the majority threshold of 0%. 
Support for the Euro Among the New Members of the Eurozone 
How has support for the euro evolved in the new member states that joined the euro after its physical introduction in January 2002, that is, in Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia? After adopting the euro, aside from short periods in Cyprus, a majority of citizens in each country has supported the euro.

Source : Figure 3 is an updated version of Figure A3 until 5/2016 (by EB's 82-85) in Roth et al. (2016: 958). 
Support for the Euro Outside the Eurozone 
In our 2012 column, we highlighted the distinct fall in public support for the euro in EU member states outside the Eurozone (Roth et al. 2012). What has happened since then? Figure 4, displaying the evolution of net support for the euro outside the Eurozone from 1990-2016, gives an answer. 
Figure 4 Net support for the single currency in non-EZ countries, 1990-2016 (%) 

Source : Figure 4 is an updated version of Figure A2 until 5/2016 (by EB's 82-85) in Roth et al. (2016: 958). 
Figure 4 suggests: Outside the Eurozone, net support for the euro has declined in a pronounced manner. Whereas in Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Poland a majority of citizens supported the euro in the years preceding the crisis, a majority in those countries has turned against the euro after the crisis. The decline in support, ranging from 65 to 30 percentage points, is strong. In contrast, in Romania and Hungary, in spite of a fall of 35 and 28 percentage points, respectively, a majority of euro support still exists. In Denmark and Sweden, the majority has turned away from euro support after the crisis. Just before the crisis, there was for brief periods a majority for the euro. The UK is an exceptional case. For the 26 years from 1991 to 2016, a majority of citizens was always against the single currency. During the crisis, net support for the euro reached levels as low as -66% (in November 2012). Given the persistent rejection of the euro, the Brexit vote should not come as a surprise but rather as reflecting a long-running critical view towards the European project. Therefore, any knock-on effects of the Brexit vote in the form of a break-up of the Eurozone via potential upcoming referenda in the Eurozone are not likely to emerge. On the contrary, recent survey data from July 2016 by the French polling institute, Ifop, suggest an enduring majority support for the euro in the Eurozone (Fourquet et al. 2016: 52). 
Conclusions 
Our updated analysis of public support for the common currency over a quarter of a century, from 1990-2016, brings out four major conclusions. 
First, in contrast to recent claims, a majority of citizens support the euro in each member state of the original Eurozone, including in Germany and Italy. This was the case even during the peak of the recent crisis. 
Second, in contrast to some critical euro voices, we do not believe, on basis of Eurobarometer data, that any knock-on effects of the Brexit vote in any potential upcoming referenda on EU issues would pose an imminent threat to the euro. 
Third, taking into account our earlier findings, which identify the unemployment rate as a key driver of public support for the euro in times of crisis (Roth et al. 2016), a strong job recovery in the Eurozone is likely to increase public support for the euro. 
Fourth, popular support for the common currency has fallen sharply after the recent crisis in EU member states that have not adopted the euro. Here the negative sentiment is strongest in the UK. 
We suggest the following bottom line: with the exception of short periods in Finland and Greece before the crisis, the evidence points towards majority support for the euro in each original Eurozone member state (including Italy and Germany) before, during and after the crisis. So far, the euro has clear backing from the public. It has adopted the common currency as its own currency.

2016 
Days Until: -3. Comment on polling: Election 'calls' have never seemed very interesting to me — were it my place to make them — in the same way that predicting when a flood will crest is a lot less interesting than understanding (and perhaps managing) a watershed. That doesn't mean predictions are not fun! Madison asked in the Federalist 51 : 'But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?' By the same token: 'What is the horse race, but the greatest of all the performing arts?' That said, putting past Water Coolers into the 'call' frame, the method I used didn't yield bad results. Rather than tracking the very noisy individual polls, I decided to use the RealClearPolitics polling averages every Monday — once a week, for sanity's sake — and plug those averages into a reasonable list of swing states provided by the New York Times, whose interactive tool then enabled me to game out scenarios in the electoral college. In all the weeks I did this but one, Trump had a plausible path to victory, depending on reasonable scenarios in individual states. In other words, still in the 'call' frame, I beat most of the paid pollsters in the political class who were, er, trumpeting Clinton's victory. And as we saw in yesterday's Water Cooler, I tied the Trump team's internal polling; they thought they were going to lose, though they qualified their views by pointing out the same plausible paths to victory that I did. Why did I not get the scale of Trump's victory? I mean, in 2008 and 2012, and maybe farther back, the Republican candiate always made a show of putting Pennsylvania in play, and it never came to anything. Trump won it! Along with Michigan and Wisconsin (where Sanders, interestingly, defeated Clinton as well). 
Policy 
'It is clear to any objective observer that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which has resulted in rapidly rising premiums and deductibles, narrow networks, and health insurance, has not been a success. A Trump Administration will work with Congress to repeal the ACA and replace it with a solution that includes Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), and returns the historic role in regulating health insurance to the States. The Administration's goal will be to create a patient-centered healthcare system that promotes choice, quality and affordability with health insurance and healthcare, and take any needed action to alleviate the burdens imposed on American families and businesses by the law' [ President Elect ]. Let us know how that works out. And: 
To maximize choice and create a dynamic market for health insurance, the Administration will work with Congress to enable people to purchase insurance across state lines. The Administration also will work with both Congress and the States to re-establish high-risk pools – a proven approach to ensuring access to health insurance coverage for individuals who have significant medical expenses and who have not maintained continuous coverage. 
And: Modernize Medicare, so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation – and beyond Maximize flexibility for States in administering Medicaid, to enable States to experiment with innovative methods to deliver healthcare to our low-income citizens 
Hmm. 
''Donald Trump has said he wants to repeal Obamacare, and we hope that wasn't an empty campaign promise,' said Twila Brase, president and co-founder of CCHF. 'It will take more than a promise to make American health care great again and to restore health care freedom to patients and doctors. Republicans need to advance visionary ideas for health care, ideas that are bigger than buying across state lines; ideas that put patients and doctors back together again without the costly interference and intrusions of profiteering outsiders. The high cost of health care comes primarily from the middlemen, including managed care and government'' [ Citizens' Council for Health Freedom ]. CCHF is a good conservative site on health care policy. I don't agree with them on policy, but CCHF is relentless and above all they don't make stuff up. 
'Obamacare 'Replacement' Might Look Familiar' [ Kaiser Health News ]. Could be. ObamaCare was, after all, originally a Republican plan, so it should be possible to rebrand it. ''It gets into a questions of semantics,' said Mark Rouck, an insurance analyst for Fitch Ratings. 'Are they really repealing the act if they replace it with new legislation that has some of the same characteristics?'… Topping the list of ACA provisions likely to survive under Trump is the requirement that employers cover workers' children up to the age of 26, analysts said. The measure is widely popular and not especially expensive…. A health law crafted by Republicans might also retain the ACA's protections for people with preexisting illness seeking coverage, said Glenn Melnick, a health economist at the University of Southern California… The ACA's biggest coverage expansion came through the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, which added more than 15 million people. Trump has suggested giving states fixed federal grants for Medicaid, which could lead to a substantial reduction in coverage or benefits.' 
'Then Donald Trump was elected president, and now the tables may have turned again. Trump has on several occasions expressed his opposition to net neutrality, once calling it 'another top down power grab' [ MarketWatch ]. 
'Who's Advising President-elect Trump on Heatlh Care?' (PDF) [ Holland & Knight ]. Rich Bagger: Executive Director (Health care policy advisor). Was Assistant General Counsel at Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield) Eric Ueland: Budget Advisor (Entitlements) Jim Frogue: Domestic Policy (Health Care, State Policy). Was Health Care Policy Analyst for Heritage Foundation [ home of ObamaCare , interestingly enough] Ado Machida: Domestic policies (Health) Ed Meese: Executive Office of the President Lead Andrew Bremberg: Domestic Policy (Affordable Care Act repeal and replace) 
'Bremberg was on Walker's team when the candidate unveiled a healthcare proposal that included repealing the Affordable Care Act and splitting Medicaid into smaller programs with separate funding' [ Modern Health Care ]. And: 'For eight years, Bremberg served in the Department of Health and Human Services. From 2005 to 2007, he was special assistant to the Immediate Office of the Secretary and from 2001 to 2005, he was special assistant to the executive secretary' [ Health Care Finance ]. And: 'Names reportedly under consideration for HHS secretary include former Louisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Gov. Rick Scott, R-Florida, and former Rep. Renee Ellmers R-North Carolina.' Thin bench! 
'One day after his election, we polled our readership of healthcare managers and clinicians to see what they think the short and long-term effects will be of Trump's policies on the healthcare sector, and we were flooded with responses. While most of them detail the deep concerns industry professionals have, a small few felt the businessman's idea could improve competition and lower costs' [ Health Care FInance ]. Good article. 
Realignment 
'At this early stage, we can't know with certainty exactly why Clinton lost. In a narrow sense, obviously, the electoral vote was lost because she lost Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Iowa. Exit polls (which are often unreliable, but all we have for the moment) and the vote distribution strongly suggest those states were lost because Clinton lost many of the white working-class voters that broke for Obama in 2012 . Overall exits show a 16-point swing to Trump among voters making less than $30,000 compared to the last presidential election — the biggest of any group in The New York Times crosstabs…. Also, general turnout was off from 2012″ [ The Week ]. So to fire the blame cannons at working class racism, you have to argue like this: 'Trump won the racist vote because the people who voted for the black guy wouldn't vote for the white woman.' Oh, OK. Now, you can deploy the misogyny blame cannons, but the identity politicians seem to be going with racism at the moment. 
'People often talk about 'racism/sexism/xenophobia' vs. 'economic suffering' as if they are totally distinct dichotomies. Of course there are substantial elements of both in Trump's voting base, but the two categories are inextricably linked: The more economic suffering people endure, the angrier and more bitter they get, the easier it is to direct their anger to scapegoats. Economic suffering often fuels ugly bigotry' [Glenn Greenwald, The Intercept ]. I would go further and urge that 'racism/sexism/xenophobia' are forms of politics, and that they are the evil twin of identity politics, and together are the only forms of politics permitted by elites . See the next link. 
'A top liberal group [The Center for American Progress] has temporarily abandoned plans for a new project designed to court white working class voters after it could not marshal the necessary financial support for the project, according to documents obtained by the Washington Free Beacon' [Washington Free Beacon (2014)]. So, the Democrats abandoned the (white) working class because the squillionaires wouldn't fund the effort to reach out to them (and here we are!) Could it be that the squillionaires had a reason for that? Like that would be against their class interests? More: 'The stated need for the project suggests potential pitfalls for Democrats in its eventual delay: In a midterm election year expected to heavily favor Republicans, CAP has apparently abandoned, for the time being, an effort to reach out to a constituency that it acknowledges could determine the viability of the Democrats' voting coalition going forward. The Bobby Kennedy Project was the brainchild of CAP senior fellow Ruy Teixeira, who for the past decade has stressed that a lasting Democratic majority will require the party to make inroads with white working class voters.' Much too little, much too late from Teixeira, who injected the identity politics virus into the Democrat bloodstream to begin with . 
'The Dems need organization and focus on the young. Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again,' Dean said' [ Yahoo News ]. Oh, HoHo. Really? After helping Clinton rig her selection as a superdelegate and smearing Trump as a coke user on no evidence ? Yeah, the 50-state strategy was great. But that was before you lost your mind!

The gain is concentrated in the expectations component' [ Econoday ]. People expect Trump to do better, then? And: 'While this is a very small sampling that is not always universally accurate, investors, traders and economists love to dwell on this report because it is really the first real look at live data for each month' [ MarketWatch ]. 
Rail: 'Week 44 of 2016 shows same week total rail traffic (from same week one year ago) marginally expanded according to the Association of American Railroads (AAR) traffic data. Rolling averages remain in contraction – but are improving' [ Econintersect ]. Finally some good news!

The Bezzle: 'If a variable is normally distributed we can use standard probabilistic techniques to analyse it. If it is not then we cannot' [Phillip Pilkington, Econintersect ]. 'So, what about economic variables? Are they normally distributed? Short answer: no, they are not.' Oops. If you look at income (a proxy for class) you don't see a bell curve. You see a power law curve. And see the last link in News of hte Wired, too. 
The Bezzle: 'In September, with typical marketing hoopla, Fitbit Inc. rolled out two new gadgets, the Charge 2 and Flex 2. Designed to measure more detailed fitness stats, the trackers were well reviewed and seemed poised to help Fitbit retain leadership of an increasingly competitive market. But within weeks the devices were piling up in stores, according to analyst spot checks' [ Bloomberg ]. In other words, the stuff wasn't moving. We need more spot checks everywhere.

It's a simple model, and business has never been better.' Reminds me of identity politics, conceptually and methodologically.

On October 30, the French government announced, as quietly as possible, the creation of a massive new database that will collect and store personal information and biometric data on nearly everyone living in the country. As tends to happen whenever a government seeks to enact this type of 'reforms,' the law wasn't passed by parliament but by decree on the eve of a national holiday. 
As France 24 reports , the new decree will affect 60 million people and 'marks the first time the country has collected population data on such a scale since the start of the Nazi Occupation in 1940.' 
'Unacceptable Excesses' 
The move has sparked outrage from civil rights groups as well as French media, with weekly magazine L'Observateur describing it as ' terrifying ,' and daily newspaper Libération dubbing it a ' mega database that will do no good '. The National Digital Council (CNNum) 'laments' the government's lack of prior consultation and highlights the 'many concerns' the new decree raises. 'In a digital world where code is law, the existence of such a database leaves the door wide open to likely and unacceptable excesses,' it said. 
The new database, known rather optimistically as Secure Electronic Documents ( Titres électroniques sécurisés or TES) will store an individual's name, date and place of birth, gender, eye color, height, address, photograph, digitized fingerprints, facial features, e-mail address, and the names, nationalities, dates and places of birth of parents. The aim — according to the government — is to make it easier to obtain and renew identity documents, and to aid in the fight against identity fraud. 
Unlike a similar law proposed by Nicholas Sarkozy's conservative government in 2012, which was shot down, the new database will only be used to authenticate individuals, not to identify them. In other words, it will be used to confirm that someone is who he or she claims to be, not to discover, say, the identity of someone whose biometrics have been found at the scene of a crime. 
However, the potential for mission creep cannot be discounted. As an article in NextInpact points out , once the database exists, it is highly likely that there will be calls for it to be used for identification purposes, simply 'because it is there.' There's also good reason to suspect that a future government 'will modify the aims,' as warns Gaëtan Gorce, a French senator and member of the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties (Cnil) who likened the TES to a 'sort of monster.' 
According to today's government, the biometric data stored on the database could be used to identify criminal suspects only if 'violations of the fundamental interests of the Nation and acts of terrorism' are involved. But who gets to decide what constitutes a 'fundamental interest of the Nation' or, for that matter, 'an act of terrorism'? [That was a rhetorical question, of course]. 
A Hacker's Paradise 
Another major problem with centralizing biometric data to this extent is that you make it a lot easier for it to be compromised. What's to stop an insider from copying this data onto a drive and walking out with it, as Snowden and others have, including those who took Swiss banking data to the French and German authorities for money laundering investigations? This data would then most likely be sold online, on the so-called darknet. 
'No computer system is impenetrable. All databases can be hacked. It's always just a matter of time,' thundered French left-wing politician Jean-Jacques Urvoas in a 2012 blog post against Sarkozy's proposed biometrics super database. Urvoas is now justice minister in Hollande's government and hence is directly involved in drawing up the new decree, which bears a striking resemblance to Sarkozy's earlier initiative. 
If biometric data is compromised, it is a far more serious issue than a compromised password or an account. You can create a new password many times. But you can create your biometrics only once. If they're compromised, they remain compromised forever. 
There's still a possibility that France's constitutional council will throw the new law out, as it did with Sarkozy's. If it doesn't, TES risks establishing a very dangerous precedent . 
Until now the most extensive biometric data retention schemes have been rolled out (perfected?) in war zones like Iraq and Afghanistan . Israel is also on the verge of creating its own centralized biometric database. But if TES were allowed to stand, France would become the first G7 nation to attempt to build a completely centralized, all-inclusive biometric database. And that would send a very clear signal — i.e. green for go — to other ostensibly democratic nations. 
There's also the fact that after Germany, France is the country with the most influence over the future direction of EU policy. The EU already has a biometrics super database called the Visa Information System (VIS), which is the largest shared database on maintaining public security, supporting police and judicial cooperation, and managing external border control in Europe. 
If the elected representatives of the 66 million people of France can pass into law a completely centralized system of biometric data storage with absolutely no public consultation whatsoever, what's to stop the European Commission's ranks of faceless, unelected, power-hungry appointees from doing the same? Nothing. 
Besides aspiring to becoming a pioneer in the collection and use of personal data of all its citizens, France's government is also one of the most ruthless combatants in the global war on cash, which is progressing on schedule.

What Does Trump's Victory Mean For NATO? NPR. Charles flags the close, which is an unusually pointed admission of the basis of our imperialist project.

Turkey is swiftly heading towards a regime of terror Bangkok Post (furzy) 
Trump Transition. I am trying, and hope you will help in comments, in pulling the noise out of the signal regarding what Trump will actually do when he becomes President and whether it will succeed, 'success' consisting first of it being implemented and second, making him and his Administration appear to be legitimate (as in keeping campaign promises, delivering tangible benefits to voters or powerful interest groups he needs on board). Despite all the changes in messaging over the course of his campaign, Trump was consistent on immigration, trade and lack of infrastructure investment, and depicted all three as ways to improve conditions for workers. And political scientist Tom Ferguson says that the data shows that the propensity to vote for Trump was highly correlated with voters giving negative answers to questions like whether the economy or the job situation had gotten better. 
Trump and Sanders found power lying in the street by virtue of both parities abandoning high employment levels and wage growth as major policy goals. But if Trump is to deliver on his promise of delivering on those goals, he is at odds with much of his own party, which is keen to keep workers weak and preserve free trade (the corporate Republicans, particularly ones whose constituents include globalized businesses like autos, for the obvious patronage reasons; libertarians, out of ideology). Given that trade policy and immigration enforcement are areas in which the President has considerable latitude, whether and how he engages in these fights will be early tests of whether he intends to and is able to execute. 
Finally bear in mind that Trump not only has a thin bench staff wise, but also intellectually. Many of his sources of advice are ideologues who like the Brexiters in the UK, may cheerily recommend changes which might sound ducky (to them) without having the foggiest clue that the operational implications are nightmarish. For instance, I'm told the Trump transition team on policy is apparently planning on recommending that the US exit Nafta and the WTO on the first day of the Trump presidency. Pray tell, have they looked into what this means for US customs, and for US exporters dealing with foreign customs? 
In other words, the right wing think tank types that the Trump team is relying on runs the risk of being as clueless about issues of organizational capacity as the Greeks were who thought they had a trump card (pun intended) in a Grexit (for those new to Naked Capitalism, we had an extensive series of posts on this topic, see here , here and here for some examples). 
So for instance, see this BBC story: 
Trump likes main Obamacare provisions 'very much' , specifically, covering pre-existing conditions and letting children up to age 26. The story describes how the Republicans might oppose Trump: 
Complicating the matter is that a 'revise and reform' effort may not fly with Mr Trump's ardent supporters and the cadre of arch-conservative politicians in Congress, who want to tear up the law 'root and branch'. 
Mr Trump often broke with Republican orthodoxy while campaigning and didn't pay a political price. He may learn that as president he won't get far without his party establishment's help. 
In WSJ Interview, Trump Says He Is Willing to Keep Parts of Health Law Wall Street Journal. Note the heavy emphasis on job creation. This had been the Democratic party lode star through the Carter era. He also defines Pence's job, which is to help on health care and sell Trump policies to Congress. This is similar to the role Joe Biden played. And he rejected the Administration 'find those moderate Syrians' strategy.

Even though this assessment of the Trump win and the implications for American politics going forward is long, it's also meaty and very much worth your attention. Mark Blyth was virtually the only person to call a Trump victory virtually from the get-go (a colleague who spends a lot of time outside the Acela corridor is another member of that club) but also correctly gamed out how the stock market would react. 
Everything Blyth says is incisive, colorful, and on the mark. By contrast, it's frustrating listening to Schiller because she is invested in way too much of the Dem orthodoxy, such as the Hillary scandals were manufactured by Republicans, that Sanders would have lost if he were the Democratic candidate, that Clinton was a victim of being a woman with a long political career (hello?). Similarly, towards the end, Blyth says, 'There is no left left,' and explains why, and then Schiller begs to differ by trying to depict the Democrats as leftist. But she does have some random insightful remarks. 
In other words, you can run the video and tune your attention in and out, although you may then want to go back and listen to just the Mark Blyth remarks a second time. There's a lot of solid material here. 0 0 0 0 0 0

Lambert here: Apparently, then, Neoliberal U plans to build 'trust-based relations' and offer 'personalised attention' by gutting tenured faculty, shifting the teaching load to contingent faculty, redistributing salaries to administrators, and socking money into fancy facilities. Let me know how that works out. 
By Philip Oreopoulos, Professor of Economics and Public Policy, University of Toronto, and Uros Petronijevic, Assistant Professor, Department of Economics, York University. Originally published at VoxEU . 
Questions over the value of a university education are underscored by negative student experiences. Personalised coaching is a promising, but costly, tool to improve student experiences and performance. This column presents the results from an experiment comparing coaching with lower cost 'nudge' interventions. While coaching led to a significant increase in average course grades, online and text message interventions had no effect. The benefits of coaching appear to derive from the trust-based nature of relationships and personalised attention. 
Policymakers and academics share growing concerns about stagnating college completion rates and negative student experiences. Recent figures suggest that only 56% of students who pursue a bachelors' degree complete it within six years (Symonds et al. 2011), and it is increasingly unclear whether students who attain degrees acquire meaningful new skills along the way (Arum and Roska 2011). Students enter college underprepared, with those who procrastinate, do not study enough, or have superficial attitudes about success performing particularly poorly (Beattie et al 2016). 
Personalised Coaching to Improve Outcomes 
A promising tool for improving students' college outcomes and experiences is personalised coaching. At both the high school and college levels, an emerging recent literature demonstrates the benefits of helping students foster motivation, effort, good study habits, and time-management skills through structured tutoring and coaching. Cook et al. (2014) find that cognitive behavioural therapy and tutoring generate large improvements in maths scores and high school graduation rates for troubled youth in Chicago, while Oreopoulos et al. (forthcoming) show that coaching, tutoring, and group activities lead to large increases in high school graduation and college enrolment among youth in a Toronto public housing project. At the college level, Scrivener and Weiss (2013) find that the Accelerated Study in Associates Program – a bundle of coaching, tutoring, and student success workshops – in CUNY community colleges nearly doubled graduation rates and Bettinger and Baker (2014) show that telephone coaching by Inside Track professionals boosts two-year college retention by 15% across several higher-education institutions. 
While structured, one-on-one support can have large effects on student outcomes, it is often costly to implement and difficult to scale up to the student population at large (Bloom 1984). Noting this challenge, we set out to build on recent advances in social-psychology and behavioural economics, investigating whether technology – specifically, online exercises, and text and email messaging – can be used to generate comparable benefits to one-on-one coaching interventions but at lower costs among first-year university students (Oreopoulos and Petronijevic 2016). 
Several recent studies in social-psychology find that short, appropriately timed interventions can have lasting effects on student outcomes (Yeager and Walton 2011, Cohen and Garcia 2014, Walton 2014). Relatively large improvements on academic performance have been documented from interventions that help students define their long-run goals or purpose for learning (Morisano et al. 2010, Yeager et al. 2014), teach the 'growth mindset' idea that intelligence is malleable (Yeager et al. 2016), and help students keep negative events in perspective by self-affirming their values (Cohen and Sherman 2014). In contrast to these one-time interventions, other studies in education and behavioural economics attempt to maintain constant, low-touch contact with students or their parents at a low cost by using technology to provide consistent reminders aimed at improving outcomes. Providing text, email, and phone call updates to parents about their students' progress in school has been shown to boost both parental engagement and student performance (Kraft and Dougherty 2013, Bergman 2016, Kraft and Rogers 2014, Mayer et al. 2015), while direct text-message communication with college and university students has been used in attempts to increase financial aid renewal (Castleman and Page 2014) and improve academic outcomes (Castleman and Meyer 2016). 
Can Lower-Cost Alternatives to One-On-One Coaching Be Effective? 
We examine whether benefits comparable to those obtained from one-on-one coaching can be achieved at lower cost by either of two specific interventions (Oreopoulos and Petronijevic 2016). We examine a one-time online intervention designed to affirm students' goals and purpose for attending university, and a full-year text and email messaging campaign that provides weekly reminders of academic advice and motivation to students. We work with a sample of more than 4,000 undergraduate students who are enrolled in introductory economics courses at a large representative college in Canada, randomly assigning students to one of three treatment groups or a control group. The treatment groups consist of: A one-time, online exercise completed during the first two weeks of class in the autumn; The online intervention plus text and email messaging throughout the full academic year; and The online intervention plus one-on-one coaching in which students are assigned to upper-year undergraduate students who act as coaches. 
Students in the control group are given a personality test measuring the Big Five personality traits. 
Figure 1 summarises our main results on course grades. Overall, we find large positive effects from the coaching programme, amounting to approximately a 4.92 percentage-point increase in average course grades; we also find that coached students experience a 0.35 standard-deviation increase in GPA. In contrast, we find no effects on academic outcomes from either the online exercise or the text messaging campaign, even after investigating potentially heterogeneous treatment effects across several student characteristics, including gender, age, incoming high school average, international-student status, and whether students live on residence. 
Figure 1 . Main effects of interventions 
Our results suggest that the benefits of personal coaching are not easily replicated by low-cost interventions using technology. Many successful coaching programmes involve regular student-coach interaction facilitated either by mandatory meetings between coaches and students or proactive coaches regularly initiating contact (Scrivener and Weiss 2013, Bettinger and Baker 2014, Cook et al. 2014, Oreopoulos et al. forthcoming). Our coaches initiated contact and built trust with students over time, in person and through text messaging. Through a series of gentle, open-ended questions, the coaches could understand the problems students were facing and provide clear advice, ending most conversations with students being able to take at least one specific action to help solve their current problems. 
Our text messaging campaign offered weekly academic advice, resource information, and motivation, but did not initiate communication with individual students about specific issues (e.g. help with writing or an upcoming mid-term). The text-messaging team often invited students to reply to messages and share their concerns but was unable to do this with the same efficacy as a coach, nor were we able to establish the same rapport with students. Our inability to reach out to all students and softly guide the conversation likely prevented us from learning the important details of their specific problems. Although we provided answers and advice to the questions we received, we did not have as much information on the students' backgrounds as our coaches did, and thus could not tailor our responses to each student's specific circumstances. 
Our coaches were also able to build trust with students by fulfilling a support role. Figure 2 provides an example of how the coaching service was more effective than the text messaging campaign in this respect. The text messages attempted to nudge students in the right direction, rather than provide tailored support. The left panel of Figure 2 shows three consecutive text messages, in which we provide a tip on stress management, an inspirational quote, and a time-management tip around the exam period. As in this example, it was often the case that students would not respond to such messages. In contrast, the student-coach interaction in the right panel shows our coaches offering more of a supportive role rather than trying to simply nudge the student in a specific direction. The coach starts by asking an open-ended question, to which the student responds, and the coach then guides the conversation forward. In this example, the coach assures the student that they will be available to help with a pending deadline and shows a genuine interest in the events in the student's life. 
Figure 2 . Distinguishing the text-messaging campaign and the coaching programme 
Coaches also kept records of their evolving conversations with students and could check in to ask how previously discussed issues were being resolved. Although we kept a record of all text message conversations, a lack of resources prevented us from conducting regular check-ups to see how previous events had unfolded, which likely kept us from helping students effectively with their problem and from establishing the trust required for students to share additional problems. 
Concluding Remarks 
In sum, the two key features that distinguish the coaching service from the texting campaign are that coaches proactively initiated discussion with students about their problems and could establish relationships based on trust in which students felt comfortable to openly discuss their issues. Future work attempting to improve academic outcomes in higher education by using technology to maintain constant contact with students may need to acknowledge that simply nudging students in the right direction is not enough. A more personalised approach is likely required, in which coaches or mentors initially guide students through a series of gentle conversations and subsequently show a proactive interest in students' lives. These conversations need not necessarily occur during face-to-face meetings, but the available evidence suggests that they should occur frequently and be initiated by the coaches. While such an intervention is likely to be costlier than the text messaging campaign in our study, it is also likely to be more effective but still less costly than the personalised coaching treatment.

Readers, I need to apologize for a Links section that's way too heavy on US election news. But we are dependent on the news flow, and the Trump Transition is dominating the news flow. More, the news flow is enormous — even if much of it is from institutions and individuals who have been, or at least should be, thoroughly discredited — and I'm sure I've missed important stories.

Anti-trust and anti-corporate Anti-imperialism 
While few radicals have made it into public executive positions either, they are numerous in politics, especially at the local level where communal ties can predominate. Radicals have always worked in organized groups—'societies,' unions, and parties—which have been a multiplier for their demands. 
Critically, these are grievance-driven policies. One could say that the goal of radicals is to force an end to exploitation, particularly economic exploitation since most radicals come from those on the bitter end of such equations. As such, many of them have specific remedies or end states. Notably absent are 'moral uplift,' better society objectives other than in the abstract sense. Further, since so much of radicalism is communally based it has often been difficult for radicals to form inter-communal alliances. 
Secondarily, since the goals are highly specific to individual groups, factionalism is endemic. Radicals have disproportionately been drawn from the poor, and from minority communities; groups who have had little to lose, and for whom even small gains loom large, especially economic ones. These have been disproportionately non-Anglo American, many of whom brought their radicalism with them from prior experiences in Europe, though occasionally their message has radicalized contemporary indigenés, for example 'Big Bill' Haywood or John Reed (or Chris Hedges). Radicals have always had to 'struggle,' not least since they have consistently been assaulted by other factions and the state: militancy was their real party card. If this wasn't necessarily violent, it was confrontational, as in boycotts and occupations (sit-downs). While radical women have always been visible, the backbone of radicals always was minority community men. Think Joe Hill and Sam Gompers. 
Many earlier immigrant communities experienced considerable oppression, and not only came to America as an escape but brought radical elements with them. That was true amongst German, Polish, Jewish, and Italian immigrants, and was relevant amongst the small West Indian population as well. Their third and fourth generation descendants are, at best, little involved with radical organizing. Present immigrant communities to the US are substantially from Central America and its surrounds, East Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. These communities have not brought radical elements with them: those have tended to stay home or go elsewhere. They have largely come here for the opportunity to better themselves, and shaking the social order is the last thing on their agenda. The exception to that are Muslim immigrants to the US, of diverse background though substantially Arab in origin. Presently, they lack indigenous American allies, and are heavily policed by the state; they are no way placed to take a vanguard position supposing that they were so inclined. 
Reviewing the summary above, it will be evident that the supply of aggrieved militants has thinned out. One could say, uncharitably, they their residual objective has been a piece of the pie, and to be left alone to eat it in dignity. 'Share the wealth,' is the substance of their message. Once they have any, the tendency is to sing another song. On a darker note, some were later sedentarized by acquiring apparatuses, which easily rancidify into patronage and rent-seeking gatekeepers. 
What radicals do best is bunch up and shove, that is organize and agitate. Those now don't bunch, and have little inclination to shove as opposed to fit in. But for blatant discrimination, present immigrants would be a reliable, conservative voter base not inclined to pursue economic grievances through activism. Without that muscle, labor has no strength. What labor has are mortgages, debt, and a lot to lose, not a matrix congruent with agitation. 
From the perspective here, progressive and radical vectors and their policies overlap directly only in a few areas. Moreover, these vectors have tended to be pursued by discrete demographic and ethnic communities, though of course values and polices have been swapped and shared at times and in places. The success of one vector has tended to advance the success of the other Said another way, they have been more powerful in combination than either would be alone. If radicals might have achieved some of their goals without progressive support, though, the reverse is not true. Progressive advocacy particularly lacks any traction at present absent effective radical agitation to make the progressives seem like 'the reasonable ones.' 
A further conclusion from this analysis is that the assault of the right has been focused disproportionately upon the prior policy and institutional gains of the radical vector. From one perspective, one could hypothesize that the broader socio-culture has focused its response upon the 'most foreign' or perhaps 'least native' contentions. I'm far from sure that I believe that myself. For one thing, the oligarchy and the right are most hostile to economic claims. With the exception of environmental activism, which has huge economic implications, most advocacy for economic justice has lain primarily with the radical rather than progressive community. Radical agitation has been the most militant, provided the most physical muscle, and is historically sourced amongst the poor, all reasons why radical successes should be expected to draw the larger reactionary attack. Then too, economic reforms are easier to attack since they are far less embedded in law than social reforms. And further, one should not assume a reactionary program will stop if and when the institutional bulwark of economic justice and organization is crushed, since there will be little to bar the marginalization or ban of existing progressive successes after such a point. 
Still, any progressive or radical revival has to take into account that the assault of reaction has been principally aimed at economic justice and its supporting legal and institutional bases in the US and the UK. 
'The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity . . . .' 
If it all seems black, consider: Social justice never seemed deader than 1957, but enormous reforms were enacted by 1974. Progressivism was never more prostrate than c. 1900, but a broad reformist agenda was emplaced by 1916. 
The downside to those comparisons, though, is that radicalism did much of the agitation to impel reform in both cases, and it is just that engaged radicalism which we most lack now. To go back a further iteration to the 1849s, progressives sans radicals were far less successful until slaver states were stupid enough to revolt. The American socio-political context is more divided and radicalism weaker today than at any time since the 1840s. 
As of 2011, I would say that progressivism is broader and better known than at any time in American history, not least because of the validation and presence of past success. We can rely on the oligarchy to push to egregious excess. What we cannot rely upon is public agitation to be the thin end of the wedge. 
Can we, then, expect oligarchical corruption and economic losses to push liberals and the haute bourgeois toward a reformist program? I wouldn't count on that, and in particular, no one should expect that to happen quickly if it occurs at all. Take as an example Dylan Ratigan's recent rant against elite corruption (to unfairly single out one prominent instance). His solution? 'Let's all get together on a Big Capitalist Spend-a-thon.' Because we're 'too divided,' so we need something like a 'Moon Program that brought us together.' Now, I don't know where Ratigan was in 1962, but that was the height of Civil Rights agitation, concurrent with mass agitation against atomic weapons testing, and also the start of the anti-poverty campaigns. His image of the country pulling together is something seen through the dollar signs on white tinted glasses, frankly. 
But there are two deeper points to take from his appeal. First, he, as many, evidently believes that capitalism will really save him and us, it's just that 'a few' have hijacked it. He doesn't want to change any system, only to get back to some non-existent past in the imagination when it worked, or rather when it worked 'for people like me . . er, us.' Many think like this, and it is a huge load of sand in the crankcase on any drive for change. What these folks want never worked for many in this society, but too many believe in retrospect that it did because that belief validates a lot of comfortable lies. That embrace of plasticine phantasies is a dead weight against change. 
Second, Ratigan inveighed against 'factionalism' even more than against corrupt oligarchs. Like many, he sees himself as in a reasonable center between 'the left' and 'the right,' and in firm American tradition mentioned above he is suspicious of special interests advocating 'their position.' So he wants us to come together around a common position. Now, the political naivety of this is stunning given the overt, anti-social, anti-citizen program of the right through a generation, pushed in private by many whom he doubtless respects in public. 
But even accepting the false analysis, what stands out is the extent to which progressives have let themselves become seen as 'special interests' advocating 'for the few.' Ratigan isn't alone; many 'liberals' and 'centrists' and 'independent voters' share this view of progressives, explicitly or implicitly. This is where progressives are in the public mind, and not simply through propaganda from the right. 
Progressives have successfully become tarred as 'factional' in significant part due to their involvement with identity politics, i.e. 'X rights.' The Democratic Party has correctly identified this imprimatur as an electoral loser, and for that reason amongst others have abandoned progressivism in the most cowardly way. However, we cannot expect 'reasonable centrists,' delusional or not, to embrace the reform program of 'those X favorers;' this will not happen. And not necessarily because 'centrists' hate 'those Xers,' but because the societal disposition is to shun advocates of minority advantage. 
One could list numerous conceptual failures amongst liberal and radical activists in this way. I'm going to limit myself to a few, with similarly few remedies to follow. Progressives have a childish fondness for a show of hands, i.e. elections, and a present obsession with the current reactionary 'hypocrite' coughed up by the oligarchy and the latter's media. Both are pointless and self-defeating. Winning elections doesn't matter; passing laws and regulations, and winning court decisions on their basis is what matters. The former may lead to the latter, but it hasn't for twenty years at least. And the oligarchy can always recruit another quisling, the supply is endless; their personalities are irrelevant. 
Moreover, the ideological ultra-right doesn't care if they are in the minority: they're delusionally convinced of their own validity, and will continue in their ways whether they get 10% or 70% of the vote. What matters isn't what they're after but simply beating them. 
Progressives have become far too obsessed with 'the agenda of the right' to the point that they themselves presently have no positive agenda, certainly none that can draw in the uncommitted. Progressive actions are wholly defensive rather than offensive, and this maximizes the oligarchy's huge advantage in money and organization. In an endless search for 'equality,' progressive activists have handcuffed themselves to the contemporary equivalent of campaigning for temperance (banning alcohol so as to 'force' uplift). These activisms and other, broader forms of identity politics aren't something I would call for abandoning. They cannot, however, recruit a wider reform movement, and indeed actively repel those of limited political education because they focus inherently on 'some, not all.' 
On the radical side, employer based privileges (i.e. 'contracts') will continue to be broad-base losers for left liberals, exactly because they inherently favor 'some, not all.' The workplace organizing model was always compromised; in the US, it has failed. Narrow unions are dead, not least because corporations can move jobs, sites, and countries far too readily. Something much in evidence now amongst anti-union working class and petit bourgeois folks who should, in principle, support unions to enhance 'prevailing standards' gains is, explicitly, spite that some have good jobs and protections while these others don't. If rightist propaganda has exploited this, the situation is nonetheless a huge bar to extending a radical reform program even amongst existing union members, to say nothing of those on the outside. Issue- and instance-specific campaigns such as opposition to fracking run into the same problems. If you are directly effected, it's a crisis; if you live 100 miles away, it's not your problem (seemingly). 
Similarly, 'Free my spliff' doesn't have much currency for non-tokers. The problem is that instance- and job-specific injustices have always been and remain primary, organizational drawing cards. These are what radicalize many individuals, and get them involved with activism to solve them. 
To me, the only way out of these dead ends lies in committing to a defined agenda of institutionalized, economic justice because this affects all. Social justice cannot be secured absent economic justice. Any such agenda is going to be anti-corporate, anti-poverty, pro-education (and job re-education), and pro-regulation. It has to be citizen-based outside of existing political parties. This kind of program can be articulated as pro-community rather than pro-faction if the organizing is done. This has to be pursued from a defined agenda, unapologetically, and from a pro-citizen(ship) position regardless of other more discrete goals. 
Will Anglo-American progressives articulate any such program and organize around it? I can't say that I'm optimistic. Yates said it best in the fewest words in a comparable social moment heading on for four generations ago. To extend upon that thought, the contemporaneous Fabian Society had a fine, progressive program. Almost anything they could have aimed for within reason was ultimately put in place too—from 1944-50 when the British Empire was derelict, the state effectively bankrupt, and the ruling class irretrievably discredited by their knee-jerk nationalism and societal niggardlyness. Between the wars, Fabian successors were unable to accomplish anything meaningful on their own. 
And yes, we too now can rely upon the oligarchy to fail. They have nothing to offer 90% of the citizenry, economically or socially. They have been serial catastrophists in their grossly speculative market manipulation, and only grasp after ever more gassy phantasms following each failure. Their 'bombsight hegemony' pursued abroad gets no peace, no silence, and no net profit. Both on an historical basis and on present scrutiny, we can rely upon the extractive class to drive themselves right into the bridge abutment of ruin. 
What we can't rely upon is for them to impact that moment quickly. From an historical and cyclical perspective, 'just waiting it out' might take until 2035, even 2045. Now a generation of squalor and iniquity in the US is nothing to remark on scaled against world-historical standards; it would fit with the rule of things rather than the exceptions. Americans think that they are exceptional, and that that isn't how they do things. Well, they'll have to live up to that, because what is certain is that we won't have reform without struggle. Government-buying oligarchs; sold-out liberals clutching their meal tickets; loose cannon fascist minority; deeply divided society: that's too many logs to leap on a single, lucky bound, or to be rolled by Some Sainted Prez (of which we'll have none). If we want change sooner than a generation of rot from now, it will have to be worked for, and worked for not with wagging fingers and dabs of money thrown at issues but with organization. 
Progressives will continue to lose as long as they continue to act with strategic irresolution and tactical incompetence. They no longer have a political party to carry their banner: the Democrats have completely shut them out. Waverers and the Great Huddled Middle won't respect, and so won't support, natterers who won't fight. 
We are not in a time for converting but one for confronting; not a time for compromise but a time for direct action. Holding actions are a way to lose slowly, an offensive program is needed. Naming and shaming, and electing the Next Great Saviour have both failed, and progressives need to get off those donkeys and articulate a real activist agenda. Spectacle gatherings which the media ignore and where everyone goes home Monday morning are presently ineffective because there is no organized base to make use of them. Money is not the main problem; feet on the ground moving forward are the real problem. A discrete agenda pursued full-time by experienced organizers is the solution. Less talk, and more walk. 
Progressives have successfully stamped Big Capital as 'anti-us' historically, and they need to return to this. Those active for social reform have to forget about the electoral cycle. They have to forget about what the lunatic Right is doing as much as possible and concentrate on what they themselves are in process of accomplishing. They need a compact reform agenda (yes, bullet points and not more than ten of them). They need a defined activist strategy, no matter how large the difficulties or time horizon appear. They need to build genuinely activist organizations with specific plans to achieve a core set of goals. And they have to reclaim militancy as a word, and deed, of pride. If they do those things, they will make real progress, and moreover they will be ready when the moment comes for breakthrough amongst the wider society. 0 0 0 0 0 0 This entry was posted in Politics on by Lambert Strether .

Lambert: A round-up of Brexit options, hard and soft. Wouldn't the Brits have an easier time of it if they wrote their Constitution down? 
By Silvia Merler, an Italian citizen, who joined Bruegel as Affiliate Fellow at Bruegel in August 2013. Her main research interests include international macro and financial economics, central banking and EU institutions and policy making. Originally published at Bruegel . 
What's at stake: last week, the UK High Court ruled that the triggering of Article 50 – and therefore the Brexit process – should involve the UK Parliament. The Government will appeal the decision but this has created a new wave of uncertainty about the timing of Brexit, and on what this involvement can mean in practice. We review the different opinions. 
Jo Murkens on the LSE blog has a very good explainer of the legal basis of the judgement, which he considers exemplary in its clarity and reasoning. The decision's focus is strictly constitutional, not political: the only question it examined was whether, as a matter of UK constitutional law, the Crown, acting through the government, is entitled to use prerogative powers to trigger Article 50 in order to cease to be a member of the European Union. This – it turns out – hinges on a balance between constitutional requirements and individual rights. 
Article 50 allows the UK to withdraw from the EU 'in accordance with its own constitutional requirements'. Turning to these requirements, the government argued that the Crown – through the government – has a prerogative power to authorise the UK's withdrawal from the EU, and that this power can only be taken away by express terms in an Act of Parliament. The court acknowledges the government's position as correct, but only with respect to rights and obligations created as a matter of international law. As soon as individual rights protected by domestic law are affected, Parliament must be involved, especially because some individual rights would be lost upon withdrawal, as they cannot be replicated in UK law. Murkens argues that the decision amounts to a proper drubbing for the government particularly because it was not the claimants that landed the hammer blow, but the government itself, by acknowledging that the Art.50 notification would inevitably lead to the loss of some individual rights. The next stop, however, is the UK Supreme Court. 
David Allen Green writes in the FT that the High Court decision is as strong as it could be and creates a substantial problem for the prime minister's Brexit policy. The government should look hard at the reason for the court's judgment. Central to the judges' thinking is the impact that leaving the EU will have on the rights of UK citizens: the court has said that extinguishing such rights cannot be done by mere executive action. But the problem is more than one of form. The difficult and interlocking legal issues created by the UK leaving the EU are such that the matter is not for a prime minister, or indeed a court, to decide. 
Allen Green argues that the government is not taking the opportunity offered by the judgment to start the exercise again, properly: an appeal has been announced and the court has been denounced. Those in favour of the UK remaining in the EU can draw only limited comfort from the decision, because there is no reason to believe parliament will directly defy the result of the referendum. The only thing that has been undermined by the High Court's decision is May's superficial approach to achieving Brexit. Eventually, the government will have to adopt a broader, more collaborative and more open approach to the process, as there is no alternative to making a success of it. 
Camilla Macdonald discusses three options and argues that the ruling is not a victory for 'soft' Brexit. The first option is for the government to succeed in overturning the result on appeal to the Supreme Court. MPs will then have the chance to debate at length, but they will have lost the leverage over the Government that the current ruling affords them. Second, the Government may lose the appeal and yet manage to 'face down the rebels' in the Commons in time to meet May's timetable of triggering Article 50 by March. This could be achieved by passing a non-amendable motion that presents MPs with a binary choice to approve or reject triggering article 50, assuming most MPs would not dare to risk the ire of the leave voting public. The third option – which Macdonald considers the most likely – is that the Government loses its appeal and is forced to introduce primary legislation, i.e. a Brexit bill, that will make it difficult, but not impossible, to meet the deadline. This is likely to force the Government to make concessions to MPs, but not necessarily in any form that will amount to a commitment to a 'soft' Brexit. 
'Soft Brexit' is what the majority of Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and part of Conservatives now want, but the biggest obstacle to this outcome is the lack of unity and of a negotiating strategy among this would-be coalition. In this situation, it is hard to see what red lines could be imposed on the government. Yet, Mcdonald thinks that involving Parliament in a process that will ultimately be defined by many complex and cross-cutting trade-offs might help to dispel the myths of simplistic 'hard' and 'soft' labelling. Nationalist parties would no longer plausibly be able to claim that they are excluded and the ruling could end up being an important victory for thought and reflection over rabble rousing on both sides. 
Jolyon Maugham writes on FT Alphaville that after the High Court's Brexit decision, we should forget about the activation of Article 50 in March. The Government's appeal is likely to be heard in the Supreme Court in early December and this opens new risks. Lingering, unaddressed, in the background to this litigation is a question about whether an Article 50 notification is reversible. The High Court in reality proceeded on the assumption that a notification, once given, could not be withdrawn. But the Supreme Court has a different legal obligation and it might feel legally compelled to address that assumption directly. Addressing it would require a politically explosive referral to the European Court of Justice, because the question of whether a notification is reversible is one of European law. Beside the likely delay of around three months, a finding by the Supreme Court that an Article 50 notification could be 'pulled' would leave ajar the door to a prospectively damaging continuation of the Referendum campaign until the time exit is formalised. 
Assuming instead that the appeal fails, the government will have to draft a Bill and place it before parliament. And that Bill would have to pass both Houses of parliament. In the Commons there would be little or no enthusiasm for rejecting it, but it is likely that MPs would impose conditions on the triggering of Article 50, thus constraining the government's negotiating position. Parliament may wish to choose whether to accept the outcome of the negotiations and it may even require that the deal negotiated by the government be put back to the people in the form of a second referendum. In practical terms, it is difficult to contemplate that these steps – drafting a Bill, debating it in the Commons, voting on amendments, placing it before the House of Lords and then addressing amendments introduced by the Upper Chamber in the Commons again – can sensibly be taken after the result of the Supreme Court appeal is known but before March. So, unless the Supreme Court overturns the High Court's decision, Maugham thinks we should consider May's March deadline ancient history. 
Stephen Booth at Open Europe makes four main points about what this decision means going forward. First, if Government loses the appeal, then legislation is likely to be necessary. The reasoning of the ruling illustrates that, if the claimants' argument holds (which regards rights stemming from EU membership set down in parliamentary legislation), the courts were never likely to be satisfied by anything short of legislation to trigger Article 50. Second, parliamentary moves to block Article 50 trigger would be politically explosive. It is unlikely that a majority of MPs in the Commons would actually move to block Brexit by preventing the Government triggering Article 50, especially having voted to give the public the opportunity to vote to leave the EU in the referendum. Booth argues that the same is probably true for the House of Lords, which would create a full-blown constitutional crisis if it opposed Article 50 outright. 
Third, Parliament's leverage over process is far greater than over any negotiating mandate or outcome. So process is likely to be the focus of any parliamentary tussles over legislation to trigger Article 50, with MPs and Lords seeking to amend the Bill to give them greater and more formal powers to scrutinise. Fourth, Booth argues that a general election is not out of the question. This would certainly mean missing the end of March 2017 deadline but would also mean that any MPs seen to be blocking the referendum result would find it very hard to keep hold of their seats and this is why he thinks it is likely that an Article 50 Bill would be passed. 
Jacob Funk Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute for International Economics argues that for now, this turn of events exposes the hypocrisy of May's government position of wanting to repatriate all EU political powers back to the United Kingdom, but wishing to deny the country's sovereign lawmakers a say on the Article 50 process. Whatever happens, the court ruling has dealt a blow to the small right-wing clique of hardcore euro skeptics in the Conservative Party and May's government and the potential direct involvement of Parliament is good political news for Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party – as his only path to becoming prime minister is the one that opens up if May and the Conservatives completely botch the Brexit negotiations. He also argues that this should also harden further the EU negotiating position. These developments make it more likely that May will soon be forced to call an early election to seek a new mandate on Brexit. The Conservatives would probably win, but an accelerating economic downturn, the United Kingdom's first past-the-post-electoral system, and a potential rallying of Remain supporters, could spring a surprise. 
Tyler Cowen argues that the British parliamentary vote might matter. The more likely scenario in his view is simply that Parliament stalls, demanding that Theresa May give them 'the right Brexit'. Of course there is no such thing, wrong Brexit is wrong Brexit, if only because EU-27 cannot agree on very much. But with enough stalling, eventually another national election will be held and of course Brexit would be a major issue, probably the major issue. That in essence would serve as a second referendum, and if anti-Brexit candidates did well enough, parliamentarians would have cover to go against the previous expression of the public will. 0 0 0 0 0 0
