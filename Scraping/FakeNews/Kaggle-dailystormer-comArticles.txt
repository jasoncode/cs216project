Listen up everybody 
It is literally less than two weeks till the election. 
@Colonel-Gunter.Brumm has had a brilliant idea. For the remainder of the race we need to focus on one last Glorious Memetic Campaign. It should primarily be focused on social media for widest distribution. 
Specifically via a 'NORMIE FRIENDLY' assault. 
Our Orders: Add a shortcut to this article to your desktop. Check the BBS for great posts and send them out across your networks. Make a new folder on your desktop just for this campaign. Archive, create, distribute Go through ALL of your archives for the best memes you have. ONLY NORMIE FRIENDLY stuff. Anti Hillary and Glorious Trump stuff. NO Hakenkreuzes, chicken and watermelons or Daily Stormer watermarks, etc. Then assemble them all along with PNGs, blank backgrounds, finished products, etc so that we can mobilze and go full Klendathu Drop on her ass for the rest of the campaign. Because this is the ONLY TIME THAT COUNTS FOR MOST SHEEPLE. We need to reach the sheeple that we allÃ‚ know personally and get them laughing, angry, emoting, etc. Deploy these normie friendly memes to flood your own personal social media, twitter etc. Put them into the hands of all of your colleagues at work, friends, relatives and their friends to flood the planet for the next 2 weeks. Again- NO Nazi stuff, just intense anti Hillary stuff right up to the edge of what we normally do and our best of the best Trump stuff we have. Make many posts, every day for the rest of the presidential campaign. Saturate all your networks (i.e. FB, Twitter etc.) Deploy all your accounts, IRLs, sockpuppets, etc. Reach out to other Alt-Right communities and have them join us. 
Check back here on this article every day to get more ammo and to leave more for others. 
Anyone that blocks you is a Hillary voter so don't worry about them. Anyone that's pro Trump will not block you and will share your stuff. Anyone undecided will read and can be swayed by the humor and horror and beauty of our memes. 
Remember this is about reaching the undecided, the fence sitters, the people who supported other candidates. The reason why they have to be specifically Normie friendly is so that everyone here feels comfortable enough to blast them into their own personal social networks. 
There are millions of us, blasting them into our networks extend their reach to billions. Stuff that your aunt and uncle can share with their friends too. We want them laughing and horrified. 
We think the best stuff to focus on is'“ Highlight her desire for war with Russia..'“ Highlight her corruption'“ Highlight Trump's heroism and genius and glory'“ Highlight that all the smart and cool and sexy people support him. 
This is for real now. Get off your ass and do your duty for the Fatherland. 
To our Non American Brothers: This is your election too. The same orders apply. Help us so that we can help you. The US is the vampire heart of ZOG. If we bring it down here, you are free. Simple as that. 
Also here are some simple tools to make stuff and modify stuff you already like. Use them, make them and then post them here for others to deploy as well.

Deadline : 
Donald Trump's star on the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker wielding a sledgehammer and pickax. The man, who told Deadline his name was Jamie Otis, said he was trying to extract the star to auction it off and raise funds for the women who have come forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them over the decades. 
The embedded terrazzo and brass star, dedicated in 2007 in recognition of the now-GOP presidential candidateÃ¢'Â™s days as host of NBCÃ¢'Â™s The Apprentice, was smashed to bits, with shrapnel flying everywhere in the early-morning hours at the starÃ¢'Â™s sidewalk home at 6801 Hollywood Blvd. near the Dolby Theatre. Check out DeadlineÃ¢'Â™s exclusive video above. 
The incident occurred around 5:45 AM with a few bystanders stopping to watch. An LAPD police cruiser showed up around 6:15, but Otis already had left the scene. 
He wanted to give money to lying sluts. 
smdh. 
None of these stupid bitches have any evidence for their retarded claims. And they must have been put up to this by someone agreeing to pay their legal fees, because they're all going to get sued, whether Trump wins or loses. 
And this man wants to give them free money. Just because. My princesses. 
The Evolutionary Roots of White-Knighting 
White-knighting has a biological explanation. Women have far more reproductive value than men do. And they are productive for a much shorter period of time. So a young fertile woman is of extreme value to the tribe, the nation, the race. This is why we all have these super-strong instincts to protect women. 
Technically, a society where the overwhelming majority of men had been killed, but the women were still alive, could recuperate. It takes a man five minutes to produce a child, while it takes a woman about three years (from conception to the point where it could exist without its mother). 
So, in a naturally functioning society, the white knight instinct is a good thing. 
However, we don't live in naturally functioning society. We live in a totally jewed-out nightmare dystopia where nature itself has been turned on its head and women have been given authority to rule over men. We have also been systematically brainwashed to believe that women are the same as men, and thus possess a similar morality to men '“ for example, we are taught that women don't lie constantly as a matter of course (they do), we are taught that they have the capacity to feel guilt (they don't, they only feel shame) and we are taught that they can use logic to evaluate situations (they can't). 
Basically, women do not have the physical strength to acquire necessary physical resources, so they have to use other methods to get what they need. 
Historically, though there was always a strong desire to protect women, women were not considered an authority on reality and there was an understanding that the basic biological nature of women is to survive on lies, manipulation and various schemes. So, while we would certainly hang a rapist if we found a rapist to have violently raped a woman, we didn't take women at their word whenever they said anything. 
We also didn't have these new forms of rape, such as 'date rape.' If a woman went to the cops and said 'I was in this man's bedroom and he raped me,' the cops would say 'well what were you doing in his room? Did he kidnap you?' 
We also would have been extremely skeptical of women accusing a rich man of sexual impropriety, as it is clear she has a whole lot to gain from doing so. 
So, even while the natural instinct is to come rushing in like a valiant knight whenever a woman cries that a man has disrespected her honor, this instinct was tempered by a logical understanding of the natural behavior of women. 
Another interesting element here worth noting is that while alpha males are much less prone to take the histrionics of women seriously, it is not because alpha males have less of a drive to protect women. It is because alpha males generally have more experience with women, and are thus much more likely to be aware of their tricks. Beta males also have the (presumably subconscious) belief that white-knighting will get them laid (protip: it does not), but this is also mainly due to a lack of understanding of female behavior due to a lack of exposure. 
There is also the fact that beta males have less testosterone, generally, and so are more likely to associate with females. You will notice that men who have 'female friends' that they are not having sex with or trying to have sex with tend to be non-masculine. You also find this among men who will spend too much time with their girlfriends. 
Men who take the opinions of women seriously on any level whatsoever tend to exhibit signs of femininity. For masculine men, a woman expressing her opinion on anything is either cute or repulsive. 
Maximizing Male Exploitation 
Women instinctively understand this current backward situation, and are using it to maximum effect. Historically, women would have been ashamed to do what they are doing now. But because they know they can get away with it '“ and they know society won't shame them '“ they are pushing it as far as they possibly can. 
And that is what we see with the Clinton campaign's use of these 'woman abuser' allegations against Trump. 
They are attacking both the male white-knight instinct, as we see this poor dumb bastard who smashed the star responding to, and they are attacking the instinct of women to unify as a collective group against men for their own protection (which is a separate phenomenon which I will go into another time '“ basically, women had to get along with each other in nature to raise each other's kids, and they often used this unity amongst themselves as a lobbying bloc against the men of their tribe/clan/village). 
The psychological elements of this election are absolutely fascinating. But most people don't understand psychology. If everyone understood psychology, then in some way, psychology itself would cease to exist, as we would all be perfectly rational robot-like beings.

In the name of the people. 
This is the only morality. 
Philippine Star : 
If his scathing and vulgar comments are causing consternation and worry among American investors and businessmen, President Duterte said yesterday they can always pack up and leave. 
Duterte was reacting to pronouncements from visiting US State Department Assistant Secretary Daniel Russel that his conflicting statements were causing jitters among US businessmen. 
Ã¢'ÂœGo ahead. Pack your bags. We will sacrifice. We will recover, I assure you. We will live and survive. We have gone through the worst of times in this planet,Ã¢'Â the President said in a press briefing at the NAIA Terminal 2 shortly before his departure for Japan. 
Russel on Friday said DuterteÃ¢'Â™s recent statements Ã¢'Â“ especially his Ã¢'ÂœseparationÃ¢'Â from the US Ã¢'Â“ have ushered in a Ã¢'Âœclimate of uncertainty.Ã¢'Â 
Ã¢'ÂœThe succession of controversial statements, comments and a real climate of uncertainty about the PhilippinesÃ¢'Â™ intentions have created consternation in a number of countries,Ã¢'Â Russel told reporters Monday after meeting Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. in Manila. 
Ã¢'ÂœNot only in mine and not only among governments, but also growing concern in other communities, in the expat Filipino community, in corporate boardrooms as well.Ã¢'Â 
Duterte called the US official gago or stupid for asking him to tone down his anti-US rhetoric, saying it was Washington that started the rift between them. 
Ã¢'ÂœI had a talk with Secretary Yasay and hereÃ¢'Â™s a guy his name is Russel, if you can just tone down our rhetoric. But I was not the one who started this rift. They are the ones who started it,Ã¢'Â the President told reporters. 
He noted that during the campaign, Ambassador Philip Goldberg got his goat when the diplomat reacted to his joke about the rape-slay of an Australian missionary during a 1989 prison riot in Davao City. 
Ã¢'ÂœRemember, it all started during the election. I made a comment in narration of an actual event which happened in Davao and which was covered by all media outlets there. The ambassador said something not very nice,Ã¢'Â he pointed out. 
Ã¢'ÂœYou are not supposed to do that because in an election of another country, you should be careful with your mouth,Ã¢'Â he said, addressing Goldberg. 
KIKE Goldberg. 
In the final stretch of the campaign, Duterte joked about the rape and murder of Australian missionary Jacqueline Hamill during a prison riot. He said Hamill looked like an actress and as mayor Ã¢'Âœhe should have been first.Ã¢'Â His remarks drew condemnation from several quarters, particularly womenÃ¢'Â™s groups. 
The rising death toll in the Duterte administrationÃ¢'Â™s war on drugs has sparked concerns among Western countries, particularly the US and the European Union. 
For Duterte, RusselÃ¢'Â™s statement was an insult. Ã¢'ÂœI said donÃ¢'Â™t do that to me. Every time they threaten us, including the EU (European Union), they think they are brighter than us,Ã¢'Â Duterte said. 
Ã¢'ÂœThen they will say Ã¢'Â˜be careful, we will put you in prison.Ã¢'Â™ Son of a w***e. Go ahead.Ã¢'Â 
Duterte maintained he would never be subservient to the interests of the US or any other foreign country. 
Ã¢'ÂœYou know before we can move forward, Mr. America, there are things Ã¢'Â“ so many things Ã¢'Â“ the massacre of the Filipinos before. These are historical hurts that would never go away,Ã¢'Â he said. He had earlier called the attention of the US to the massacre by its soldiers of hundreds of Muslims in the early 20th century. 
Ã¢'ÂœI am not also a lapdog of any country. Only the Filipinos can treat me as a lapdog. Period. Nothing else. 
Ã¢'ÂœDo not make us dogs. Do not. As if I am a dog with a leash and then you throw bread far away that I cannot reach.Ã¢'Â 
Duterte had previously branded US President Barack Obama a Ã¢'Âœson of a b***hÃ¢'Â and told him to Ã¢'Âœgo to hell.Ã¢'Â 
Duterte also hit Russel for supposedly being too nervous about his recent state visit to China. 
Ã¢'ÂœNow, what did I tell to China? I went there, just being nice,Ã¢'Â the President said. Ã¢'ÂœI am just a small person. How can I cause distress? You are nervous because you are guilty.Ã¢'Â 
Duterte said his state visit to China last week triggered a lot of speculations. 
Ã¢'ÂœNapakabilis ng malisya ng mga gago (These fools were quick to think maliciously). We did not talk about anything in China except to cook siopao and chopsuey,Ã¢'Â the President said in jest. 
Duterte also scored GoldbergÃ¢'Â™s statement that the US remains committed to defend the Philippines. 
Ã¢'ÂœThere will be no wars anymore. Who will wage war with us? China? What will they get? Japan? What defense? They want to talk about the boogeyman war,Ã¢'Â the President said. 
Ã¢'ÂœStop that s**t. Nobody is interested in wars anymore. And if there is a fight, you fight your wars. Do not include mine.' 
Pure shitlordery. 
So great to see. 
And just for those who don't get it: Duterte is not 'anti-American,' he is anti-ZOGmerican. Filipinos have no problem with the American people, they have a problem with being slaves to international kike financial institutions and then, as already enslaved through massive debt programs and foreign ownership of infrastructure, being told by the Jew globalists that they're not allowed to slaughter drug dealers because it's mean. 
Duterte is doing what every leader should be doing by default: defending the people from enemies foreign and domestic. 
He is creating a new model of governance in the post-industrial era.

What do they want, you ask? 
More. 
All they ever want is more. 
And they're not going to stop until we stop them. 
Physically. 
NBC NY : 
The inbound upper level of the George Washington Bridge was closed by an immigrant rights protest on Wednesday morning, snarling traffic on one of the region's most important crossings at the height of rush hour. 
Delays at the bridge for traffic heading into New York from New Jersey were up to nearly 90 minutes; traffic cameras showed bumper-to-bumper traffic barely inching along. 
The protesters apparently chained themselves across the roadway to block traffic, unfurling large banners in an attempt to spread their message. One banner appeared to read 'Resist, Organized, Act Up!' 
Drivers were clashing with the protesters in an effort to get the bridge open, according to witnesses. Police quickly detained the small group and traffic began moving again about 15 minutes. 
The Port Authority said 10 people who were blocking the eastbound lanes were arrested. No injuries were reported. The agency said it is investigating.

The prophecy is coming true. 
Every cuck loser who enters Trump's proximity turns into a mega-shitlord. 
Newt Gingrich just taught the slut Megyn [sic] Kelly how to shut her whore mouth. 
Wow. 
Washington Post : 
Gingrich, on Fox in his role as a Donald Trump surrogate, had questioned the stories of women whoÃ¢'Â™ve come forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault  and the relative importance of the controversy itself, relative to Hillary ClintonÃ¢'Â™s alleged misdeeds. 
Kelly pushed back. Ã¢'ÂœAs a media story, we donÃ¢'Â™t get to say that 10 women are lying. We have to cover that story, sir,Ã¢'Â said the Fox anchor. 
Ã¢'ÂœSure. Okay,Ã¢'Â Gingrich said. Ã¢'Âœ So, so itÃ¢'Â™s worth 23 minutes of the three networks to cover that story, and Hillary Clinton had a secret speech in Brazil to a bank that pays her 225,000 [dollars], saying her dream is an open border where 600 million people could come to America  thatÃ¢'Â™s not worth covering Ã¢'Åš Ã¢'Â 
Ã¢'ÂœThat is worth covering,Ã¢'Â interjected Kelly. Ã¢'ÂœAnd we did.Ã¢'Â 
Gingrich was still speaking: Ã¢'Âœ Ã¢'Åš I mean, you want to go back through the tapes of your show recently, you are fascinated with sex, and you donÃ¢'Â™t care about public policy. Ã¢'Â 
Ã¢'ÂœMe? Really?Ã¢'Â she said, laughing. 
Ã¢'ÂœWell, thatÃ¢'Â™s what I get out of watching you tonight,Ã¢'Â Gingrich said. 
Cue crosstalk. 
KELLY: Ã¢'ÂœYou know what, Mr. Speaker, IÃ¢'Â™m not fascinated by sex. But I am fascinated by the protection of women Ã¢'ÅšÃ¢'Â 
GINGRICH: Ã¢'ÂœOkay.Ã¢'Â 
KELLY: Ã¢'Âœ Ã¢'Åš and understanding what weÃ¢'Â™re getting in the Oval Office Ã¢'ÅšÃ¢'Â 
GINGRICH: Ã¢'ÂœOkay.Ã¢'Â 
KELLY: Ã¢'Âœ Ã¢'Åš and I think the American voters would like to know Ã¢'ÅšÃ¢'Â 
GINGRICH: Ã¢'ÂœAnd, therefore, weÃ¢'Â™re going to send Bill Clinton back to the East Wing, because after all, you are worried about sexual predators.Ã¢'Â 
Ã¢'ÂœYeah, listen, itÃ¢'Â™s not about me,Ã¢'Â Kelly said. Ã¢'ÂœItÃ¢'Â™s about the women and men of America. And the poll numbers show us that the women of America, in particular, are very concerned about these allegations and, in large part, believe that they are a real issue. And donÃ¢'Â™t dismiss the women Ã¢'ÅšÃ¢'Â 
And: resume crosstalk. 
GINGRICH: Ã¢'ÂœYou want to comment, you want to comment Ã¢'ÅšÃ¢'Â 
KELLY: Ã¢'Âœ Ã¢'Åš donÃ¢'Â™t dismiss the women summarily.Ã¢'Â 
GINGRICH: Ã¢'Âœ Ã¢'Åš on whether the Clinton  do you want to comment on whether the Clinton ticket has a relationship to a sexual predator.Ã¢'Â 
KELLY: Ã¢'ÂœWe on Ã¢'ÂœThe Kelly FileÃ¢'Â™ have covered that story as well, sir. I will tell you, the polls Ã¢'ÅšÃ¢'Â 
GINGRICH: Ã¢'ÂœNo, I just want to hear you use the words. I want to hear you use the words Ã¢'Â˜Bill Clinton, sexual predator.Ã¢'Â™ I dare you. [At that point, Gingrich was smiling slightly. Kelly was not.] Ã¢'ÂœSay Ã¢'Â˜Bill Clinton, sexual predator.Ã¢'Â™Ã¢'Â 
KELLY: Ã¢'ÂœMr. Speaker, weÃ¢'Â™ve covered  excuse me, sir Ã¢'ÅšÃ¢'Â 
GINGRICH: Ã¢'ÂœDisbarred by the Iowa, by the Arkansas bar.Ã¢'Â 
KELLY: Ã¢'ÂœExcuse me. excuse me.Ã¢'Â 
GINGRICH: Ã¢'ÂœDisbarred by the Arkansas bar. Eight hundred fifty thousand dollar penalty.Ã¢'Â 
KELLY: Ã¢'Âœ Ã¢'Åš excuse me, sir. We on Ã¢'Â˜The Kelly FileÃ¢'Â™ have covered the Clinton matter as well. WeÃ¢'Â™ve hosted Kathleen Willey Ã¢'ÅšÃ¢'Â 
GINGRICH: Ã¢'ÂœWell, try saying it.Ã¢'Â 
KELLY: Ã¢'Âœ Ã¢'Åš weÃ¢'Â™ve covered the examples of him being accused as well, but heÃ¢'Â™s not on the ticket. And the polls also show that the American public is less interested Ã¢'ÅšÃ¢'Â 
GINGRICH: Ã¢'ÂœHeÃ¢'Â™ll be in the, heÃ¢'Â™ll be in the East Wing.Ã¢'Â 
KELLY: Ã¢'Âœ Ã¢'Åš in the deeds of Hillary ClintonÃ¢'Â™s husband than they are in the deeds of the man who asks us to make him president, Donald Trump. WeÃ¢'Â™re going to have to leave it at that, and you can take your anger issues and spend some time working on them, Mr. Speaker. Thanks for being here.Ã¢'Â 
GINGRICH: Ã¢'ÂœAnd you, too.Ã¢'Â 
I haven't seen a bitch get shut down like this since the 80s. I thought he was going to reach through the screen and start slapping her around, OLD SCHOOL. 
I hate this bitch so, so much. 
She alone is proof that women should never, under any circumstances, be allowed to leave the kitchen or speak with men who are not their husbands, fathers or brothers. 
Because really, as funny as this exchange was, it isn't really about sex. If it was about sex, as Newt mentions, she could easily focus on Bill, who is a literal rapist. 
It is about sexism. 
Anti-male sexism by a feminist whore. 
Megyn [sic] Kelly should be in prison.

Radio Aryan October 26, 2016 
Dr Matthew Raphael Johnson joins Matthew Heimbach for WednsdayÃ¢'Â™s edition of The Daily Traditionalist to comment on geopolitics and starts by lamenting Albania being a member of NATO, when the country has no military force or hardware. Matt then brings us the news that a huge NATO force is amassing in the Baltics and Eastern Europe in the largest build up on RussiaÃ¢'Â™s border for 3 decades and they are specifically calling these forces Ã¢'Â˜battle groupsÃ¢'Â™. Dr Johnson thinks Russia had really better watch out now that Albania is on board. 
Albania is well integrated into the EU hydra, yet itÃ¢'Â™s whole economy is based upon whores and heroin. They claim their biggest business is agriculture, yet they import everything they eat from outside, which seems to be a common problem among recent EU members. The process seems to be to bring countries that were self-sufficient into partnerships where they will then have to rely on others. This has happened with various former Soviet countries that were brought into the EU and Matt brings us another example in Venezuela. Norway has now broken itÃ¢'Â™s previous declaration to not allow American troops on itÃ¢'Â™s soil and Dr Johnson reminds us that Norway is a competitor with Russia for oil supplies. 
Matt points out that Russia has new updated nuclear warfare technology that the western media is calling Ã¢'Â˜satanÃ¢'Â™ and Dr Johnson thinks this move forward in technology was a reaction to the sanctions in Russia. It forced them to nationalise industries and do things for themselves and they will now be food independent by 2020. This is exactly what the NWOÃ‚ doesnÃ¢'Â™t want, a self sufficient nation able to defend itself without having to go cap in hand to America. 
The conversation then moves to America and Dr Johnson explains what polls mean when they say they are Ã¢'Â˜over-samplingÃ¢'Â™. This means that it is not a random sample but has been picked to over represent certain groups. The polls are just there to try and make it look less suspicious should they try to steal the election, because every form of registration online such as Facebook and Twitter shows Trump trouncing Clinton in supporters. 
The Democrats were given HillaryÃ¢'Â™s questions from the media before being asked and the evidence is there that hired thugs have alsoÃ‚ been used to intimidate Trump voters. If this was happening anywhere else in the world it would be universally condemned as an invalid election. It is also completely illegal to shut down a political rally, yet we have seen this happen more than once. 
If the election was cancelled however, it would just mean more of Obama in office, so there are not really any options of what else to do if these felonies were actually prosecuted. The level of corruption is so high that it is clear to everyone, in fact America could be in a pre-civil war state at the moment. When similar staged elections took place after the Jew instigated coup in Ukraine, Donesk and Luhansk rose up and separated themselves from the rest of the country. Could something like that ever happen in America?

US and Allies Openly Massing Huge Army on Russian Border! 
Andrew Anglin October 26, 2016 WWIII: Do it for Ambulance Boy, goyim pigs. 
You know, maybe we should do a referendum, like 'do you think we should have a nuclear war with Russia to save ISIS because of human rights and barrel bombs?' 
I mean, I know most people probably agree with the Jews that the human rights of Syrians are a pretty damned good reason for a third World War. 
But I think in a Democracy, the people should have a right to make the call. 
Reuters : 
Britain said on Wednesday it will send fighter jets to Romania next year and the United States promised troops, tanks and artillery to Poland in NATO's biggest military build-up on Russia's borders since the Cold War. 
Germany, Canada and other NATO allies also pledged forces at a defense ministers meeting in Brussels on the same day two Russian warships armed with cruise missiles entered the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Denmark, underscoring East-West tensions. 
In Madrid, the foreign ministry said Russia had withdrawn a request to refuel three warships in Spain's North African enclave of Ceuta after NATO allies said they could be used to target civilians in Syria . 
TARGETING CIVILIANS, GOYIM! 
RUSSIANS ARE PURPOSEFULLY KILLING SYRIAN BABIES 
WHY???? 
Well, no one knows. 
I guess because they are just really mean people. 
The ships were part of an eight-ship carrier battle group '“ including Russia's sole aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov '“ that is expected to join around 10 other Russian vessels already off the Syrian coast, diplomats said. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the troop contributions to a new 4,000-strong force in the Baltics and eastern Europe were a measured response to what the alliance believes are some 330,000 Russian troops stationed on Russia's western flank near Moscow. 
RUSSIA HAS A MILITARY INSIDE THEIR OWN COUNTRY 111 
WHY WOULD A COUNTRY HAVE AN ARMY IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY???? 
IT IS A PERFECTLY MEASURED RESPONSE TO MOVE THOUSANDS OF TROOPS ACROSS AN OCEAN AND PLACE THEM ON THEIR BORDER!!!! 
'This month alone, Russia has deployed nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad and suspended a weapons-grade plutonium agreement with the United States,' Stoltenberg said, also accusing Russia of continued support for rebels in Ukraine. 
Those ballistic missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. 
NATO's aim is to make good on a July promise by NATO leaders to deter Russia in Europe's ex-Soviet states, after Moscow orchestrated the annexation of the Crimea peninsula in 2014. 
NATO's plan is to set up four battle groups with a total of some 4,000 troops from early next year, backed by a 40,000-strong rapid-reaction force , and if need be, follow-on forces. 
As part of that, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced a 'battle-ready battalion task force' of about 900 soldiers would be sent to eastern Poland , as well as another, separate force equipped with tanks and other heavy equipment to move across eastern Europe. 
'It's a major sign of the U.S. commitment to strengthening deterrence here,' Carter said. 
Britain's Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Britain would send an 800-strong battalion to Estonia, supported by French and Danish troops , starting from May. The United States wants its troops in position by June. 
London is also sending Typhoon fighter aircraft to Romania to patrol around the Black Sea, partly in support of Turkey. 
'Although we are leaving the European Union, we will be doing more to help secure the eastern and southern flanks of NATO,' Fallon said. 
SYRIAN SHADOW 
Others NATO allies joined the four battle groups led by the United States, Germany, Britain and Canada to go to Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. Canada said it was sending 450 troops to Latvia, joined by 140 military personnel from Italy . 
Germany said it was sending between 400 and 600 troops to Lithuania, with additional forces from the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Croatia and Luxembourg. 
Stoltenberg said allies' commitments would be 'a clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond.' Diplomats said it would also send a message to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has complained that European allies do not pay their way in the alliance. 
SEND A MESSAGE ALSO TO TRUMP!!!! 
IT'S NOT JUST ISIS OR UKRAINE WE'RE SAVING HERE '“ WE ALSO HAVE TO STOP DONALD TRUMP!!! 
The choice is very clear: 
Will we allow Putin to help Assad barrel bomb his own people by bombing ISIS and thus deny Syrian babies of human rights? 
Or will we launch a massive World War inside of Europe to stop human rights atrocities in Syria? 
I think we all know the morally correct answer to this question. 
But still though. Let's have a referendum, just to make sure we're all on the same page here.

Russia Tests Nuclear-Capable Ballistic Missile '“ But Have You Heard That Trump Grabs Pussies? 
Andrew Anglin October 27, 2016 
Basically, we've got a Road Runner vs Wile E. Coyote situation going on here. 
The West just keeps coming-up with these elaborate, stupid schemes and Russia plows right past them. 
I am really not sure that the West understands exactly what they've gotten themselves into here. 
RT : 
Russian strategic missile troops reportedly launched an RS-18 ballistic missile on Tuesday. The launch may have been a test of the advanced hypersonic glider warhead, which would be able to defeat US anti-missile systems. 
The test was conducted at midday from a site near the town of Yasny, Orenburg region, in the southern Urals, and the warhead reached the Kura test range in Kamchatka in RussiaÃ¢'Â™s Far East. 
Ã¢'ÂœThe test was a success. The warhead was delivered to Kura field,Ã¢'Â the Defense Ministry reported. 
Popular defense blog MilitaryRussia.ru says the launch was meant to test RussiaÃ¢'Â™s hypersonic glider warhead, currently known by its developer designation, Ã¢'Â˜object 4202Ã¢'Â™, or Aeroballistic Hypersonic Warhead. 
A select few countries are currently developing the technology. The US has the HTV-2, a device developed by DARPA that has two partially successful tests under its belt. The Chinese warhead using the same technology is called DF-ZF, with Beijing first confirming a test in 2014. India is also studying hypersonic flight technology, but unlike Russia, the US and China, it is reportedly not developing a strategic missile warhead. 
A hypersonic glider vehicle (HGV) is different from a conventional ballistic missile warhead in that it travels most of the time in the stratosphere rather than in space. It gives an HGV-tipped missile greater range and may give anti-missile systems a shorter window to respond to an attack. 
We are at a point in history where the American people are forced to make a decision. 
Which is worse: 
A) Joking about sex with another man in a private conversation on a bus, or 
B) Nuclear war 
If only the media were putting things in these terms. 
I wonder why the media doesn't put things in these terms?

Business Insider : 
Donald Trump praised former House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Wednesday for his fiery interview with Fox News host Megyn Kelly on Tuesday night. 
'By the way, congratulations, Newt, on last night,' the Republican nominee said during a press event at the opening of his new hotel in Washington, DC. 
Trump added: 'That was an amazing interview. Amazing interview. We don't play games, Newt, right? We don't play games.'

Woman Claims Trauma From Sexual Assault'¦ In a Video Game 
Eric Striker Daily Stormer October 25, 2016 
Any time a hobby or institution is taken over by women, it's the final symptom of said entity's terminal illness. The typical female dichotomy of a thick skull covered by a thin skin puts the balance of actions and consequences completely out of whack, thus ruining fun and slowing progress for the rest of us. While childish female nagging about a man's world of freedom to think and act is laughed at and dismissed in a sane society, in our current one it is often the stated justification for crack downs on political dissent and the censorship of constructive discourse. 
If I were to seriously argue that playing a World War II shooting game gave me Post-Traumatic Stress, you would laugh at me. Yet a woman arguing the sexual assault equivalent in a news platform is given center stage, and you better take her seriously. 
Mic : 
Last week I was groped in virtual reality. Did you know that could happen? I didn't, but now I'm all the wiser. 
A few minutes later I started a new QuiVr game, and hit multiplayer mode. In multiplayer mode, other real-time players appear beside you. Every player looks nearly identical with a floating helmet, a persistent bow in one hand, and another free-floating hand. Keep that free-floating hand in the back of your mind. 
So, there I was shooting down zombies alongside another real-time player named BigBro442. The other players could hear me when I spoke, my voice the only indication of my femaleness. Otherwise, my avatar looked identical to them. 
In between a wave of zombies and demons to shoot down, I was hanging out next to BigBro442, waiting for our next attack. Suddenly, BigBro442's disembodied helmet faced me dead-on. His floating hand approached my body, and he started to virtually rub my chest. 
'Stop!' I cried. I must have laughed from the embarrassment and the ridiculousness of the situation. Women, after all, are supposed to be cool, and take any form of sexual harassment with a laugh. But I still told him to stop. 
This goaded him on, and even when I turned away from him, he chased me around, making grabbing and pinching motions near my chest. Emboldened, he even shoved his hand toward my virtual crotch and began rubbing. 
There I was, being virtually groped in a snowy fortress with my brother-in-law and husband watching. 
As it progressed, my joking comments toward BigBro442 turned angrier, and were peppered with frustrated obscenities. At first, my brother-in-law and husband laughed along with me  all they could see was the flat computer screen version of the groping. Outside the total immersion of the QuiVr world, this must have looked pretty funny, and definitely not real. 
Remember that little digression I told you about how the hundred-foot drop looked so convincing? Yeah. Guess what. The virtual groping feels just as real. Of course, you're not physically being touched, just like you're not actually one hundred feet off the ground, but it's still scary as hell. 
My high from earlier plummeted. I went from the god who couldn't fall off a ledge to a powerless woman being chased by an avatar named BigBro442. 
I wasn't as experienced a player as BigBro442. Everywhere I ran, he appeared beside me, ready to grope as soon as the zombie wave was over. I'd had enough. With a final parting obscenity, I yanked the headset off my face and stood back in the sunny, familiar room of my brother-in-law's home. 
What had just happened? I hadn't lasted 3 minutes in multiplayer without getting virtually groped. 
What's worse is that it felt real, violating. This sounds ludicrous to anyone who hasn't stood on that virtual reality ledge and looked down, but if you have, you might start to understand. The public virtual chasing and groping happened a full week ago and I'm still thinking about it. 
Now that the shock has mostly worn off, I'm faced instead with the residual questions about the unbridled misogyny that spawns from gaming anonymity. It's easy to dismiss the most egregious offenses as the base actions of a few teenage boys, but I don't think it's as rare as a few bad apples. 
How could it be, when my brother-in-law has played multiplayer mode a hundred times without incident, but my female voice elicited lewd behavior within minutes? 
As VR becomes increasingly real, how do we decide what crosses the line from an annoyance to an actual assault? Eventually we're going to need rules to tame the wild, wild west of VR multiplayer. Or is this going to be yet another space that women do not venture into? 
Women are allowed, sure, but the BigBro442s of the world will make sure you never want to come back. 
So this woman apparently doesn't mind gratuitous interactive violence, but wants to make it a criminal act to give a power-glove smack to her imaginary character's dragon-titties. I don't have any experience with virtual reality and haven't played any video games in many years, but I'm going to guess there's plenty of games where you can pet ponies, try on lots of clothes and other entertainment that protects the fragile innocent eyes and ears of empowered 21st century womyn. 
The reason increasing numbers of men escape into their video games is because of the total lack of adventure and heroic opportunities offered in our real world. The film Fight Club deals with these issues, and women themselves are unhappy with the current state of men, even as they continue to vote for or spearhead Jewish causes that further legally and culturally emasculate men. 
One thing I've noticed in 'progressive' women is that they are equally as appalled by men talking about pussy or spanking them on the ass in an imaginary video game as they are aroused by images and content featuring extreme masochistic sex. The more women pressure men into deferring to their baby shit, the more radical and vicious their rape fantasies become. 
If you don't know much about women or have never been with them, I'll tell you a secret: women sexually love to have their hair pulled, slapped around, roughed up '“ within reason. Women are naturally masochistic and are wired to submit to men, but this instinct is being taken to extreme levels via the pornography modern women are consuming. This kind of material is pretty inhumane and ventures into the territory of bizarre and disturbing (images of women being mutilated, fisting, pissed on, violent body destroying sodomy, vicious beatings). Men don't watch this stuff at anywhere near the level women do. 
Most of the people watching this stuff are female. But somehow, they feel they have the right to barge into male-oriented spaces and sanitize them, not because they're genuinely offended, but rather because their increasingly grotesque and pozzed sexual fantasies make them feel ashamed, so anything that might remind them of their deranged thoughts, or even embarrassingly arouse them, like a 15-year-old boy groping them in a video game for laughs, needs to be treated like a real world crime.

If Megyn [sic] Kelly Doesn't Want Her Pussy Grabbed, Why Did She Pose for This 'Grab My Pussy' Photo Shoot? 
Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 27, 2016 
Megyn [sic] Kelly has continually asserted over the last two weeks that she personally fears that if Donald Trump is elected President, he will use his Presidential powers to grab her by the pussy. 
However, this begs the question: if Megyn [sic] Kelly is so concerned about having her pussy grabbed, why did she pose for this 'grab my pussy' photo shoot for GQ? 
Keep in mind, these pictures are from 2010. She wasn't some dumb college student trying to make a few bucks to pay rent with a quick 'grab my pussy' photo shoot. She was already a multi-millionaire Fox News host. 
Last year, when the whore Kelly was attacking Trump as a sexist, he pointed out this 'grab my pussy' photo op, and noted that Kelly is a bimbo. 
In response to allegations of bimboism, Kelly told People Magazine : 'I was 40, and I was pregnant, I was like, 'I look pretty good.'' 
Of course, in woman-speak this translates to 'I was 40, and I was pregnant, and I wanted to send the message to random men that they should grab me by the pussy to confirm that I am still attractive.' 
And sure, the pictures do look good, but they are airbrushed all to hell and back 
For instance, she is wearing a push-up bra, but the curvature of her breasts has been corrected and wrinkles have been removed from the place where her breasts connect to her chest and from her neck. Armpit wrinkle removal is also plainly obvious. 
So nothing is proved by these pictures '“ other than the fact she wants her pussy grabbed. 
In the same year, 2010, she went on the Jew Howard Stern's show and said that she wanted to fuck Bill O'Reilly, which is bizarre and I believe sick. In this interview she also talked about her breasts and her husband's penis size. 
(Full interview here .) 
It is not like she didn't know she was walking into a sex interview here. That is Stern's entire shtick. And everyone knows who Howard Stern is. 
So the only reason she would go on this show is to sexually objectify herself, which again, is to feel sexy when old and beginning to sag 
All of this simply confirms that Megyn's continued attacks on Donald Trump '“ such as we saw Newt Gingrich slap her around like an even cheaper hooker than she actually is for earlier this week '“ are part of a gigantic shit test against Donald Trump. 
Basically, Kelly's entire career is now devoted to trying to bully Donald Trump into grabbing her by the pussy. 
Tsk-tsk, Megyn [sic]. 
Tsk-tsk. 
Roger Ailes Firing Conspiracy Confirmed? 
Way back when Fox News chief Roger Ailes was fired '“ OVER A SEXUAL HARASSMENT HOAX THAT MEGYN [sic] KELLY TOOK PART IN BY SAYING HE HUGGED HER WEIRDLY '“ I said that it was obviously part of an anti-Trump conspiracy by the station's owner, Rupert Murdock . 
Murdock, while claiming to be a 'conservative,' is an elite globalist and friend of the Clintons. 
Ailes, while not a perfect guy (shilled for Bush's wars, shilled for Israel), is a friend of Trump and wasn't going to allow this whore Kelly '“ as well as a whole bunch of other hosts and pundits '“ to betray the network's viewership by shilling for Hillary Clinton. 
Because that is exactly what we are seeing now: a massive betrayal of Donald Trump by the Fox News channel. 
O'Reilly hasn't been horrible, but he hasn't been great either. 
The only one who has consistently supported Donald J. Trump is Sean Hannity, and his ratings have now gone through the roof because of it. I'm half-surprised Murdock doesn't just fire him for it, but I suppose that wouldn't work, as the entire viewership would boycott the channel. Right now, they can do a lot of damage to Trump by having the majority of their hosts shill for Hillary, but still having a few support Trump so they don't totally expose themselves as being part of a Clinton conspiracy.

Rigging the Election '“ Video IV: Democrat Operatives Willfully Accepting Illegal Foreign Donations 
Lee Rogers Daily Stormer October 26, 2016 
Project Veritas has released a new video, part IV of their 'Rigging the Election' series, which shows footage of Democrat operatives willfully accepting what was presented as a $20,000 donation from a foreign source. This is more documented evidence of criminal activity by these characters. It is against the law to accept foreign donations in this capacity. 
The foreign source was actually working under cover with Project Veritas. They ended up wiring $20,000 from a Belize bank that the Democrats happily accepted. Once they received the money they started having discussions with the undercover man about granting special access, etc. 
What makes the whole thing interesting is that they only returned the $20,000 after they realized that their operations had been infiltrated. It shows that under normal circumstances, they have no issue with accepting foreign donations even though it is against the law. 
So far, Project Veritas has released video evidence documenting Democrat conspiracies to commit vote fraud, conspiracies to agitate violence and a willingness to accept illegal political contributions from foreigners. Then you have all the Wikileaks stuff that has been dumped. This entire operation surrounding Hillary Clinton is about as corrupt as you can get. 
It looks as if Project Veritas is slowly working their way up the Democrat food chain in these videos. While this might be wishful thinking, I hope they have damning footage of Hillary Clinton that they'll dump at a time to cause maximum political damage. I guess we'll see.

JewTube Shuts Down Bill Clinton's Black Son Danny Williams 
Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 27, 2016 
The filthy Christ-killing Jews who run YouTube have shut down the account of Bill Clinton's Black son Danney Williams AKA America's Favorite Clinton AKA The Greatest Clinton Generation AKA The Good Clinton AKA D'Jamal Clinton AKA My Favorite Black Guy. 
Seriously. 
WND : 
YouTube on Wednesday suspended the account of Danney Williams, the 30-year-old man who has claimed since the 1990s to be the black son of former President Bill Clinton. 
YouTube, citing Ã¢'Âœrepeated or severe violations of our Terms of Use and/or Community Guidelines,Ã¢'Â declared the account Ã¢'Âœcannot be restored.Ã¢'Â 
The YouTube decision blocked the nine-minute feature Ã¢'ÂœBANISHED Ã¢'Â“ The Untold Story of Danney Williams,Ã¢'Â which had received 1.2 million views since Williams posted it last week. Produced by filmmaker Joel Gilbert, it drew nearly 100,000 views per day and more than 1,000 viewer comments, with the overwhelming majority expressing support for Williams and outrage at the Clintons for not being willing to allow a DNA test to determine paternity. 
Like the reporting you see here? Sign up for free news alerts from WND.com, AmericaÃ¢'Â™s independent news network. 
Ã¢'ÂœMy YouTube account has been deleted, but the same video appears in 50 other places on YouTube alone,Ã¢'Â Williams said on his Facebook page after being notified of YouTubeÃ¢'Â™s decision. Ã¢'Âœ[YouTube] canÃ¢'Â™t handle the truth! Please share #BillClintonSon.Ã¢'Â 
Twitter also continues to allow Williams to post the Ã¢'ÂœBanishedÃ¢'Â video on Danney WilliamsÃ¢'Â™ page, but the Twitter link to YouTube displays the message: Ã¢'ÂœThis video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated. Sorry about that.Ã¢'Â 
This young lad has bravely come out and confronted his evil father who won't even give him any money. The media has attacked him as a Trump plant. 
Danney has been raising kids since he was 16. He needs money. His kids need money. But old grandpa Bill the rapist won't give a cent. 
The least Bill could do is dip into his quarter-billion dollar fortune and buy these Black grandkids some friggin bikes. I mean come on. 
Here's the video. 
I highly recommend this video. It is a fantastic voyage with great music. 
Make sure to download it and reupload it for when this copy gets shoah'd. 
Alex Jones also interviewed him recently and his Vegas press conference was spectacular. 
Danney Clinton should be running for President. At least he's a good person. He raises his own kids and takes them to church. 
When Trump is in control and Bill and Hillary are in prison, Danney should be given control of the Clinton Foundation. And least then his kids can get bikes. 
Follow Danney on Twitter and support him.

Diversity Macht Frei October 27, 2016 
The Jews have successfully foisted Holocaust propaganda on the entire western world, instilling generations of Europeans with an irrational sense of guilt about their own culture, history and civilisation. Children are forced to read Anne Frank's bogus diary, which was written by her father. Trips to Auschwitz are expensively arranged. Schindler's List is dutifully screened. And politicians line up to pay their respects at Holocaust Memorial Day. 
The focus on Hitler instead of other higher-bodycount mass murderers like Stalin and Mao, and the elevation of Jewish victimhood at the expense of other targeted groups, constitute an extraordinary manifestation of Jewish Privilege; one that begins to seem anomalous sooner or later. And this sense of its anomalousness provokes attempts turn the Holocaust propaganda ceremonies into more general commemorations of suffering. In Eastern Europe, as I have written about before, there has also been an effort to draw parallels between Hitler and Stalin, advancing the notion of a 'Double Genocide'. 
But the Jews are not happy about this attempt to take their preciousss away. Writing in the Jerusalem Post, Seth J. Frantzman even calls this tendency towards universalism a 'second genocide'. 
In recent years there has been a tendency to revise the history of the Holocaust. In the West this takes the form of universalizing it and diluting its meaning. For instance a statement by then EU high representative for foreign affairs Catherine Ashton in 2014 didnÃ¢'Â™t mention Jewish victims when it sought to Ã¢'Âœhonor every one of those brutally murdered in the darkest period of European history.Ã¢'Â 
'¦ 
THE DOUBLE genocide concept being advanced in Eastern Europe appears slightly less pernicious than that of universalization. Whereas universalization turns every atrocity into a Ã¢'ÂœholocaustÃ¢'Â and accuses Jews of being Ã¢'ÂœparticularistÃ¢'Â or Ã¢'Âœjudeo-centricÃ¢'Â for caring about the Shoah, the double genocide view accepts that there was a Holocaust but then wants to add another pillar of victims beside it, not totally dilute the two. 
However Efraim Zuroff has noted that this amounts to Ã¢'Âœclaiming that Communist crimes were just as bad as those of the Third Reich and in fact constitute genocide, and the glorification of Lithuanians who fought against the Soviets.Ã¢'Â The result is that in countries across Eastern Europe there is an attempt to lionize those like Stepan Bandera, the Ukrainian nationalist who fought the communists. 
But what happens when those local nationalists were also antisemites or when the local narrative is that, yes, the Nazis killed many Jews, but Ã¢'ÂœweÃ¢'Â lost many more to the Soviets. For them commemoration of the Jewish victims palls in comparison to their own historic memory. 
Double genocide is built on local nationalism that wants the countryÃ¢'Â™s suffering to come first, not Holocaust memory. Universalism is built on disappearing the Jewish victims of the Holocaust and replacing them with everyone. Universalism constitutes a second genocide, aimed at memory and taking away of Jewish rights to memorialize their own people, a right taken away from no other group. 
Source 
So we goy have our marching orders. We must prostrate ourselves in front of the Holocaust from now to eternity, humbly handing over cash to its 'victims' and their descendants; we must meekly acknowledge the 'uniqueness' of their suffering; we must beseech their forgiveness. And we must never ask why it is that, across thousands of years of history, the Jews have so consistently provoked antagonism among the peoples they have lived among.

Madman Merkel Demands the Internet Publicly Release All Closed-Source Code 
Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 27, 2016 This woman is looking haggard af. Botta start calling her Merkel Haggard. New song for refugees refusing deportation: 'I think I'll just stay here and drink, riot, rape, sell drugs and commit acts of terrorism (allah akbar remix)' 
There comes a time in the life of every brutal totalitarian psychopath that they just have to lash out against everyone and everything, demand it all be shut down. 
RT : 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel launched a broadside at internet media giants, accusing them of Ã¢'Âœnarrowing perspective,Ã¢'Â and demanding they disclose their privately-developed algorithms. Merkel previously blamed social media for anti-immigrant sentiment and the rise of the far right. 
Ã¢'ÂœThe algorithms must be made public, so that one can inform oneself as an interested citizen on questions like: what influences my behavior on the internet and that of others?' said Merkel during a media conference in Berlin on Tuesday. 
Ã¢'ÂœThese algorithms, when they are not transparent, can lead to a distortion of our perception, they narrow our breadth of information.Ã¢'Â 
Google uses an algorithm to decide which search results are first shown to a user, while Facebook arranges the order of the news feed, and decides to include certain posts from a userÃ¢'Â™s liked pages and friends, at the expense of others. Both sites also promote links to news articles, often based on a userÃ¢'Â™s own media interests. 
I don't know about Facebook, but Google's algorithm is worth billions and billions of dollars. The algorithm is why people use Google instead of Bing. If they released the algorithm, it would effectively make their main product '“ their search engine '“ valueless, beyond the value of its brand name. 
That's why it's not open-source in the first place. Because if they released it, everyone would use it, and their service would no longer have any unique value. 
Asking them to release this 'because I said' is completely and totally insane '“ the demand of a madman who thinks the universe belongs to him. 
These algorithms are at the core of the intellectual property of any social media or search website, and comprise some of the most highly-protected trade secrets in the world, potentially worth billions. No internet giant has ever revealed its inner workings. 
Merkel did not specifically name Facebook, Google or Twitter, but implied that the large platforms are creating Ã¢'ÂœbubblesÃ¢'Â of self-reinforcing views, and squeezing out smaller news providers. 
'The big internet platforms, via their algorithms, have become an eye of a needle which diverse media must pass through to reach users,Ã¢'Â warned Merkel. Ã¢'ÂœThis is a development that we need to pay careful attention to.Ã¢'Â 
The internet giants themselves have argued that the so-called social media bubble is largely a myth, and that online users have a wider access to differing views than under a pre-internet model, where most news would be acquired from just a handful of newspapers and one or two TV channels. 
This is obviously absolutely true, and it's absolutely why Merkel is throwing a fit. 
She wants media to be limited to approved sources. 
These approved sources still have an extreme amount of control, as we see with the Trump situation, but in order to maintain her multicultural utopia, Angela Merkel needs complete 1984-style control of all information the public has access to. 'We've always been at war with Russia to protect ISIS, Winston.' 
And that's control over international (read: American and Russian) media, because in Germany, they can just go arrest anyone who is saying things they don't like on the internet. They arrest people for Facebook posts. 
This is not the first attack on social media by Merkel and her Grand Coalition government, and while the German politician advocates diversity of views, she has previously accused it of perpetrating opinions that are most at odds with those of the establishment and traditional media. 
Last month, Merkel accused AfD, the recently-established anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim party, which receives overwhelmingly negative coverage in most newspapers, of Ã¢'Âœspreading their liesÃ¢'Â through social media , as it achieves breakthroughs in regional elections around the country. 
A year ago, at the height of the refugee influx into the country, Merkel, who was first elected in 2005, was caught on a hot mic personally pressing Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to clamp down on anti-migrant posts during a UN session in New York. 
A fortnight ago, the leader of MerkelÃ¢'Â™s parliamentary CDU faction, Volker Kauder, said that social media should be fined Ã¢Â‚Å¹50,000 for failing to remove Ã¢'Âœhate speech,Ã¢'Â saying that a Ã¢'ÂœSword of DamoclesÃ¢'Â has to hang over social media. Kauder also called for warnings, similar to those on cigarette packs or before entering pornographic websites, to be given to those about to go on social media. 
Justice Minister Heiko Maas Ã¢'Â“ who said that there had been a 77 percent increase in hate crimes following the arrival of 900,000 asylum seekers Ã¢'Â“ has given internet media companies until February next year to comply with EU directives on xenophobia and racism, or face legal action. 
This looks to me like the first huff of the last gasp. 
Mama Merkel tried. 
But Merkel Haggard has lost control. 
Now, she's about to see the fightin' side of Germany.

Monkeyball is on the steep decline. 
People would rather watch a super-violent show about a masculine White man destroying his enemies. 
Deadline : 
Even after one of the bloodiest and darkest episodes in the AMC seriesÃ¢'Â™ history, The Walking Dead really does have something to celebrate about its Season 7 debut Ã¢'Â“ and weÃ¢'Â™re not talking a fantasy sequence. With 17 million watching the October 23 premiere to discover who Negan would kill and 10.7 million among adults 18-49 for an 8.4 rating, the zombie apocalypse blockbuster had a very good night as the No. 1 show on broadcast and cable. 
How good? 
Well, TWD knocked the stuffing out of the often-dominating Sunday Night Football demo-wise this weekend , left the Season 3 debut of Big 4 heavy hitter Empire Season 3 in the dust, and solidly bested its own Season 6 premiere last year. Add to that, the show based on the Robert Kirkman comics basically matched its all-time series highs of the Season 5 opener of October 12, 2014 in both viewers and the demo. And, with maybe a slightly aging fanbase after all these years, pile on that the Season 7 opener set a series high among adults 25- 54 (10.5 million), making it clear that The Walking Dead is alive and kicking at this point deep into its run, when most other shows are DOA. 
NFL ratings are collapsing completely. 
Awful Announcing : 
The NFLÃ¢'Â™s downturn in ratings has been the dominant sports media storyline of the fall of 2016. And unfortunately for the league, itÃ¢'Â™s not getting any better, especially when it comes to the primetime windows. And while there are a number of factors at play in whatÃ¢'Â™s ailing the NFL right now, the quality of the primetime games isnÃ¢'Â™t helping. 
In spite of featuring the gameÃ¢'Â™s most storied rivalry in Bears-Packers, Thursday Night Football was down 17% versus last year. The abysmal 6-6 tie between the Cardinals and Seahawks was unsurprisingly down 15% from last year, proving that not all close games are guaranteed to drive viewership. The Monday Night Football matchup between Houston and Denver was also uninspiring and down 13% from last year . 
Fox Sports exec Michael Mulvihill has been tweeting out numbers throughout the season and through seven weeks now, itÃ¢'Â™s obvious that Fox and CBS coverage on Sunday afternoons are being affected much less by the NFLÃ¢'Â™s ratings challenges than in primetime. With all three primetime windows dropping this week, TNF, SNF, and MNF are all down AT LEAST 18% in viewership from this time a year ago. 
This is a massive drop. 
Massive. 
Though the kike media is coming up with all sorts of excuses (you see the above quoted article blaming the quality of the games, lel '“ others are blaming the election ), none of them are looking at the most obvious thing that has changed in America over the last couple of years, and that is race relations. 
Sportball Americans AKA 'The Blacks' have become insanely hostile toward the White population of this country, so it makes absolute sense that people are now less interested in watching these vicious apes throw balls at one another. Nigga ah be botta frow dis ball over der, dat oder nigga botta be catch dis ball, din he gunna run ober der. nigga nigga nigga fugg wite ppl muffugguh ah keel u nigga fu shii t. 
The Colin Kaepernick hate-protest against America itself '“ which many of his fellow apes have joined in '“ certainly isn't helping the situation any. Yes, Mr. Grossman, please, please take it to the next level . I simply cannot express to you how much I want you to do exactly that. 
As I have always said, racial tension is good for the White movement. Polarization is always good for revolutionaries. Black Lives Matter is doing our work for us. When White people see Blacks rioting and attacking Whites, when they witness this hateful rage against them (for something they never did), it triggers an instinctive, tribalist reaction. 
Hence, collapsing monkeyball ratings. 
For their part, Jews are totally incapable of understanding the concept of 'going too far.' As long as there is room to push it further, they will keep pushing it further, and they are oblivious to potential backlash. We see this with the sexual liberation. Some people would have chilled out once gay marriage was solidified, but they moved on to trannies and now they're headed for pedophilia . 
Because we are the underdogs in this race war against the kikes, it is necessary to always understand and exploit their weaknesses. They biggest weakness is this incapacity to stop pushing everything as far as it can be pushed. This is why they were kicked out of over 100 European nations/territories, and why they will eventually be rounded-up and expelled from the United States of America. 
Look for rap music sales to drop next. You can take that prediction to the bank. 
The Walking Dead as Implicit Fascist Propaganda 
Okay, so nobody liked seeing Rick f that n last season. I get that. 
At the end of season 5, I was working on a very long essay about the show, and then ended up canning it because I knew there would be outrage over the season six sex act. 
But even with that element, The Walking Dead remains a type of implicit fascist propaganda, due to the themes themselves. It is almost like they have to include these multicultural elements in order to avoid open accusations of fascism. 
The setting is one of survivalism, during a zombie apocalypse, where the only way to survive and protect your people is to be ruthless. And the hero, who began the show as a bright-faced golden boy trying to help everyone is now an unrepentant mass-murderer, who will kill anyone who messes with his people. If you ignore the racial element, the show is utterly fascist, as it denies the concept that Jews have pushed in their media since they founded Hollywood that 'the ends never justify the means' and unrepentantly shows its hero '“ a masculine blue-eyed White male '“ justifying the most violent of means to the end of protecting his people. 
This is, I believe, why the show has been so overwhelmingly popular. It touches the same longing for primal masculinity that Fight Club touched. It justifies the thing that all men, at the heart of their being, know to be true: that every aspect of the basic order of nature will ultimately be reduced to physical violence. 
This season opened with the enemy tribe engaging in extreme acts of physical violence against the heroes of the show ( so brutal that television watchdog groups are complaining ), and the only possible response to this is going to be physical violence. There will be no Jewy 'overcoming adversity by being the better man.' Our hero Rick will hunt down and slaughter his enemies, and he will feel no guilt. Because this is the way you take care of your people: by destroying your enemies. 
There is also an implicit theme relating to immigration and Black revolt, with the zombies themselves representing the non-White hordes overrunning our countries. I have written about that before . Zombies in TWD Migrants in Slovenia 
Just for the record, I believe there is approximately zero chance that any of the shows creators are consciously promoting these themes (conversely, I have argued that the creator of Breaking Bad was probably at least partially aware that he was promoting fascist themes). However, though the show's creator Robert Kirkman is probably something of a cuck, given that he has put all of this multiculturalism in the show (though there are no gays or trannies), he isn't a Jew, meaning his Aryan racial soul is capable of expressing itself subconsciously. Robert Kirkman: definitely looks a bit cucky, I must say. 
You can also check the show's Wikipedia page and see that there are apparently no Jews involved in production at all (I only see Jew names in the editors column, and only two of them) '“ which is something of a miracle just based on statistics, given the number of Jews that work in television. 
Anyway, maybe you hate the show, maybe you like it, maybe you don't know anything at all about it. I personally watch it, as well as a few other popular shows (always while doing other things, usually answering email or commenting on the bbs '“ I ain't got time to just sit around and watch shows, fam), because it's important to me to understand what is going on with popular culture '“ TWD is the most popular of popular culture. And I have to say that I think that overall, this shows popularity among young White men says something very good about the current state of the collective unconscious of our people, in the same way that the dropping popularity of monkeyball says something good about the collective unconscious of our people.

Germany: Moslem Pulls Over Bike to Masturbate at White Girls, Police Say He Did Nothing Wrong 
Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 27, 2016 
Everyone in the Western world must ask themselves the question: what do I love most about diversity? 
For me, it's a very, very difficult question to answer. 
But when it comes right down to it, I have to say that I think the greatest benefit of diversity is the vibrancy. 
Since Wednesday is the sex Gangster (27) of Longerich is a permanent topic of conversation in social networks. Now heÃ¢'Â™s taken! 
That same evening he was arrested by police in Longerich and brought in for questioning. 
According EXPRESS information he should be a Persian, which is reported in a [] camp. He is said to have at least three cases exposed and masturbating in front of women. Two of the women (28, 41) have filed a complaint. 
'¦ 
After questioning the man was released. Ã¢'ÂœInvestigation against him were initiated. But since there are no grounds for detention, he was after the interrogation go again,' said a police spokesman. 
It's disgusting that a full 2/3rds of German women will file a complaint against a diverse vibrant who is doing absolutely nothing by expressing his rich cultural heritage in the form of a unique historical tradition which reflects his incredible cultural identity. 
I long for the day when German Nazism finally ends, and these White sluts learn to shut their filthy infidel whore mouths.

Daily Mail : 
A newlywed couple have claimed their big day was ruined when a man burst inside the church shouting 'Allahu Akbar' and then started tearing down wedding decorations. 
Groom Marcel Lohbeck, 35, and bride Friederike were celebrating their wedding with 90 guests in the Karmel Church in Duisburg, a city in western Germany. 
Lochbeck said: 'At the beginning of the ceremony, a man with a thick jumper and a hat on came into the church and sat in the back row. 
'Shortly afterwards, he stood up and wandered around the candles. He laughed in a disturbing manner and then fondled the statue of Mary. 
'He had been speaking in Arabic and partly English. He then started destroying the flowers and kept shouting 'Allahu Akbar'. 
Police officer Ludger A., 57, the uncle of the groom, reportedly tried to intervene along with the church sexton. 
The officer said: 'We tried to calm the obviously traumatised Syrian man.' 
After the man again refused to leave the church, there was a fight in which the police officer got slight injuries to his face. 
Yet he managed to restrain the man until his colleagues from the Duisburg police could arrive. 
After a medical examination, the 23-year-old Syrian man was taken to a psychiatric hospital.

16-Years-Old smdh. He's Only a Child. 
Andrew Anglin October 27, 2016 Click to enlarge 
As I've said for a long time now, it appears that Neo-Nazi satirists have infiltrated the Jewish media and are using their positions to mock the insane depths to which Jew lies have sunk. 
Seriously, if I was running the Guardian, I would absolutely run this on the cover: a picture of a 40-something Negro crying, with the headline that he's a child and a caption saying he's 16-years-old. 
If I was going to push it further than this, I would print the lyrics to Eric Clapton's 'Tears in Heaven' in the sidebar. And I am predicting now that they are going to use this song in a video about Calais migrants having no where to go now that the French Nazis burned their camp. Or rather, now that they burned their own camp because the French Nazis told them they had to leave and it is 'their tradition' ( IRL quote from French official ) to burn their homes when they leave them. 
Would you know my name If I saw you in heaven? Would it be the same If I saw you in heaven? 
I must be strong'Cause I know I don't belong Here in heaven 
Would you hold my hand If I saw you in heaven? Would you help me stand If I saw you in heaven? 
I'll find my way Through night and day'Cause I know I just can't stay Here in heaven 
Time can bring you down Time can bend your knees Time can break your heart Have you begging please, begging please 
Beyond the door There's peace I'm sure And I know there'll be no more Tears in heaven 
Would you know my name If I saw you in heaven? Would you be the same If I saw you in heaven? 
I must be strong'Cause I know I don't belong Here in heaven

Sky News: Kay Burley, 55 interviews Nigel Farage 
Nigel Farage: 
The Labour Party, historically, was there to look after working communities in this country, and it's given all of that up in favor of an open door to southern and eastern Europe. 
Sky News Female: 
But isn't that racist? 
Nigel Farage: 
I don't think it is. No. I don't think it can be deemed as such in any way. 
But we've never in our history had a complete open door, and now we have one to 485 million people. 
I don't think, in terms of common sense, that really adds up. 
Sky News Female: 
But if you're a 'racist', according to the Oxford English dictionary, it means that you have or are showing the belief that a particular race is superior to another. 
Presumably, if you're saying that British people should have jobs above east Europeans, you're suggesting that they're superior and, as a result, that's racist. 
Nigel Farage: 
Well, actually, this is a big argument in London amongst the Afro-Caribbean community, fifty percent of whose youngsters haven't got jobs. 
And that same survey that was done recently showed over 60% of the settled ethnic minorities in this country also believe that we have got to have some degree of control. So this crosses all boundaries within this country. 
Sky News Female: 
OK, you're getting bogged down in the figures, again. 
And, as I said, remember to what happened to Mr Clegg when he did that. [hand gesture] 
I've given you the definition of 'racist'. [hand gesture] 
You've told me what you thought about the fact that British workers should have a superior chance of getting a job above European workers, whether they're from eastern Europe or whatever, and that is quite simply a 'racist' comment. 
Nigel Farage: 
No, it isn't. It is a job of the British government, firstly, to defend the realm and, secondly, to put the interests of the people that live in this country, first. 
That's what we should be doing, and I'm afraid we've turned out backs on that over the course of the last few years, which has led to much, much unhappiness among millions of families. 
... 
How can anyone take more of this ludicrous 'racist' propaganda any longer? 
What they refer to as 'racism' is protection of the vital interests of oneself and of one's own kind, in one's own land. 
As if an Afro-Caribbean settlement belongs in any normal European society? 
As if European interests may only be defended using the shield of the interests of the non-European invaders themselves? 
How can European man not see this for what it is, and how can European man allow himself to be subjugated to this degree?

Jewish Exodus From GOP Driving Rise of Neo-Con Left 
Eric Striker Daily Stormer October 27, 2016 
The 2016 Presidential election has shown the worthlessness of wing labels, as MoveOn.org menopausals in fanny packs who opposed the Iraq war join hand in hand with the very Neo-Con Jews that planned it in an attempt to thwart the anti-war candidacy of Donald Trump. Well-funded think-tanks and NGOs speaking on behalf of discredited and dutifully misrepresented ideologies, from Catholicism to ' Human Rights ,' are tripping over one another to come up with a new and unique justification for an American clash with Russia and Iran over some Jihadists in the Syrian Civil War. 
The merge between the cultural Marxist Left and Zionist neo-liberal war mongering has been accelerating in intellectual spaces for the last few years now, and now the foil of Donald Trump, whose blunt and direct rhetoric offends the shallow Pavlovian sensibilities of Venti-sipping bespectacled 'world citizen' bourgeois jizz bags, is cementing this disturbing amalgamation. 
Darlings of the faux-dissident Left, like Michael Moore and hardline Jewish supremacist Bill Maher, have dropped all pretense of being renegade opponents of war and vulture-capitalism by taking money (Moore) or putting racial interests (Maher) ahead of any principles and seamlessly submerging themselves as transitory ambassadors and cogs in new Wall Street first, invade-the-world Democrat machine of Hillary ['s Jew donors ]. 
Somehow Donald Trump, the only candidate opposed to NAFTA and TPP, against reckless foreign interventions and regime-changing, who backs the closing of the carried interest loophole that allows investment banking firms to dodge massive amounts of taxes, who in his Gettysburg contract to the American people promised to bust bloated Zionist cartels like Comcast '“ is triggering the singularity of everyone from the Communist Party USA and the National Review. 
The message is clear: the liberal left is the humanitarian alibi for plutocratic money, while the conservative right employs moral preening and Christianity to manipulate public opinion. The only principle that unites both is the foaming at the mouth globalist hostility towards white working people of their (((patrons))) and (((intellectuals))), which supersedes everything else. This is why when push comes to shove, there is no meaningful difference between the left and the right. 
The Trumpian collapse of the 'Reagan coalition' has made neo-con Jews flee the GOP. People like Jerry Falwell Jr. are realizing that the agreement to push Israel and 'free' trade on their largely working class and rural followers in exchange for some socially conservative concessions has been a one way street, and are now beginning to practice a degree of autonomy clinging to Trump's coattails. Jewish neo-cons like Jennifer Rubin have for years perceived red state protestants as corruptible rubes incapable of self-starting thought, and are now enraged that the Goyim are going their own way. 
They were right to a point, as the Bush era shows, but as these churches and institutions struggle to keep White people in their pews, they are beginning to reflect and adapt to the dreams and desires of the people they serve. The leading Jewish Republicans of America are looking for a new shell to crawl into, which is why most of them are advocating votes and support for Hillary Clinton. If Trump wins, they will certainly be migrating en masse to the Democratic party, and DNC Zionist plutocrats like Haim Saban will be anticipating them with open arms. 
We are already seeing this to an extent right now. For example, 'Republican' Jew Robert Kagan has been a huge Hillary Clinton promoter, to the point where his wife, the Jew Victoria Nuland, is being eyed as a candidate for Secretary of State under a future Democratic administration. Malleable and obedient Clinton was lavished with praise Ã‚ during her stint as Secretary of State in anti-Trump Jew 'conservative' Bill Kristol's Weekly Standard. 
The Cancer of (((Post-Modernism))) Devours Its First Political Victim 
Encapsulating the rising New-New-Left is the young Jewish millennial being groomed by the New York Times and other establishment Jew publications as a future globalist brain-trust cabal member,Ã‚ Milo Beckman. In an extended piece called 'Don't vote for Hillary Clinton because you have to'“vote for her because she's a true progressive ,' Beckman rationalizes Hillary's love of pointless military interventions as a way for liberals to impose their values around the world, and says that progrssives ought to defer to Hillary wanting to kill millions of people because she has more credentials (modern Leftists believe credentials come before common sense): 
Okay, letÃ¢'Â™s talk about foreign policy. 
So why is she a hawk? 
Well first, letÃ¢'Â™s be clear: ItÃ¢'Â™s very easy, and very damaging, to pretend that foreign policy can be divided into Ã¢'ÂœhawkÃ¢'Â and Ã¢'ÂœdoveÃ¢'ÂÃ¢'ÂŠÃ¢'ÂŠthat some people want more war and some people want less. Obviously, this isnÃ¢'Â™t close to true. 
And yet, point by point, Clinton has recommended more aggressive military action in a number of situations. Foreign Policy magazine identifies seven total examples: Haiti, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Libya, bin Laden, and Syria. Why? 
1) Hillary Clinton is a liberal transnationalist. She believes in the primacy of human rights, particularly of individuals against oppressive governments. She dreams of a future system where nations are encouraged to adhere to international norms by something like the UN on steroids. 
2) Hillary Clinton believes in firm commitment to international agreements. The only way to bring about this future globalist order, the argument goes, is to honor our present commitments and compel others to do the same. 
3) Hillary Clinton does not see inaction as morally distinct from action. As long as youÃ¢'Â™ve factored in all costsÃ¢'ÂŠÃ¢'ÂŠin lives, dollars, and potential long-term unintended consequencesÃ¢'ÂŠÃ¢'ÂŠshe believes every viable course of action (including inaction) should be considered on its merits. As with domestic policy, she has little patience for non-interventionist ideologues. 
4) Hillary Clinton equates military might with moral responsibility. In the end, she is a cold realist: Whoever has the biggest stick sets the agenda. By shirking international responsibilities, the United States transfers power to the next biggest stick. 
In this context, many of ClintonÃ¢'Â™s Ã¢'ÂœhawkishÃ¢'Â decisions make a good deal of sense. AgainÃ¢'ÂŠÃ¢'ÂŠIÃ¢'Â™m not saying I personally support the decisions, but I understand where sheÃ¢'Â™s coming from. ItÃ¢'Â™s not because she doesnÃ¢'Â™t care about brown lives or doesnÃ¢'Â™t understand that actions have consequences. 
But as relativist as I am, there are some things that I canÃ¢'Â™t really argue with. Girls should be allowed an education. Governments shouldnÃ¢'Â™t gas their citizens. We absolutely shouldnÃ¢'Â™t expect to correct every infraction, but itÃ¢'Â™s not exactly innocent to sit back and let Putin dictate what happens in Syria either. 
And when it really comes down to it, I feel woefully unqualified to make these kinds of judgments. I always have to remind myself: Clinton is smarter than me, more knowledgeable and more experienced than me. I should absolutely voice my concerns when I have them, but I shouldnÃ¢'Â™t pretend that this kind of reasoned disagreement is even close to disqualifying. 
Another manifestation of the New-New-Left is the gaslighting of journalist Michael Tracey. A number of liberal trolls on twitter and in the mainstream media have been bombarding guilty-by-association accusations against the once-respected leftist journalist for the horrible crime of'¦ covering Wikileaks and accurately juxtaposing Trump and Hillary Clinton's policies. 
In fact, the establishment mulattoes vying for a place in the NWO are working the 'white privilege' angle hard on White Leftists who are hesitant about voting for the female George W. Bush. If you don't vote for Hillary, it's because you're racist. There have been dozens of articles sighted to attack weak-willed White Sociology majors in this vein , looking to bully thoughtful left-leaning White people into supporting the borderless global capitalist status quo. 
In-house extreme Left-wing intellectuals like (((Noam Chomsky))) have endorsed Hillary, not to mention (((Bernie))).Ã‚ Their stance is clear: risking a third world war with Russia is a worthy risk if it means maintaining an uncontrolled flow of non-Whites to replace America's majority population. Those Leftists who are smart enough not to get on the Hillary bandwagon have seen their solicitations to media appearances cut down to a trickle '“ see Cornel West's last appearance on Real Time With Bill Maher to see what it looks like when they do get on. 
While their snark and condescension assumes it's only 'right-wing' people who fall into line like sheep, the way the Left has reigned in its radical elements in an attempt to propel Hillary to victory is a testament to the incredible weakness of the 'far-left': it is trotted out when it supports a plutocratic agenda (non-White immigration, intervention in Syria, Ukraine or Libya, using fag 'rights' and feminism as a geopolitical club to fan discord in Russia and Iran), then put back into the box once it achieves this goal (or in the case of former libertarian left Julian Assange, many leftists are hoping to put him in a casket). 
A minority of genuine, authentic Marxists and Leftists notice that the mass media is giving Evan McMullin a titanic amount of undeserved publicity, while pretending Green Party's Jill Stein is non-existent. Kooky Gary Johnson was at the beginning featured all over the place, but he too is fading into obscurity once polls registered him taking more votes from Hillary than Trump. 
The only choice in 2016, of the two major parties, is Donald Trump, whether you're on the left or the right. The White labor left in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania will ignore their union bosses and vote for Trump. The new GOP is on the path of becoming an actual Worker's Party, to quote Trump. Those who seek to contain the excesses of capitalism, globalization and foreign war (whether left or right) to any degree this election cycle should honestly weight the options '“ the choice becomes obvious. 
This isn't about Left vs Right, it's about Whites vs Jews. You can pick your own side, or go back to being used as a dupe, no different than those patriotards during the Bush era that liberals used to mock.

Radio Aryan October 27, 2016 
Sven Longshanks joins Matthew Heimbach to discuss the ongoing fall out from President HollandeÃ¢'Â™s treacherous solution to the Calais jungle problem. Instead of rounding all the invaders up with extreme prejudice and sending them back to Libya, he has decided to make every town in France a gift of 50 jungle monkeys each. He must love what they have done to Calais so much, that he wants the same for every town in the country. Diversity really does mean destroying every White community in the world by filling then all up with a quota of hostile invasive species. 
Sven brings us the shocking news that five Ã¢'Â˜Syrian migrant childrenÃ¢'Â™ have already gang raped a child at the British childrenÃ¢'Â™s home they were placed in this week. These Ã¢'Â˜unaccompanied minorsÃ¢'Â™ were supposed to only be coming to Britain if they had family in the country, but thanks to an amendment added to the law by a Jew called Dubs, any brown person claiming to be under 18 whose life would be better in Britain than where they are now, has to be let in. This stupid law means that every juvenile in the third world could lay claim to a right to be allowed into Britain. This Jew is directly responsible for that child being raped and Matt reminds us of the fact that it is traitors in our own governments everywhere who are doing this to us. 
George Soros and other global players have been funding the criminals at Calais while they lie in wait to ambush a lorry and break into Britain and we see similar patterns emerging there that we see among the other groups that he funds. Black Lies Matter burned down Ferguson and the squatters at Calais burned down the Jungle last night too, but not before first taking some time out for another gang rape. Sven points out that this goes on regularly in Africa where it costs little to replace a burned down straw hut or dung shelter, but in the developed world it costs a fortune to repair the damage these Blacks cause. 
After bringing up the subject of how much it costs to care for those who hate us, Matt brings us some good news on the British economy, which we had been told by the lying media was bound to plunge into recession if there was a vote to leave the EU. It has actually increased by a percentage and Sven finishes the podcast by giving us a quick rundown of the state of play with Brexit, the Conservative Party and UKIP, who it is hoped will soon be led by Paul Nuttall.

Today Dr. Duke and Dr. Slattery talked about HillaryÃ¢'Â™s clear acts of treason against the United States by providing massive shipments of weapons to Saudi Arabia at a time that she knew they were providing support to ISIS. Dr. Duke, if elected to the Senate, would be in a position to expose Hillary and push for her impeachment should she win (steal) the election. 
Dr. Slattery discussed post-election scenarios. He noted that if Trump wins in a close election, a small number of Republican electors could be bribed to vote for Hillary, throwing the election to her, or even vote for Pence, throwing the election to the House of Representatives to decide from amongst Trump, Hillary, and Pence. Should Hillary win and Trump supporters feel the election was illegitimate, impeachment would be more likely. 
This is an extremely educating and enlightening show. Please share it widely.

Chapo Trap House': New Left-Wing Podcast is a Flagrant Rip-Off of The Right Stuff 
Eric Striker October 27, 2016 These fags here. 
Last March, a group of Williamsburg trust fund Bernie bros started a podcast called ' Chapo Trap House .'Ã‚ The humor style and format of Chapo Trap House content is a left-wing carbon copy of the types of radio shows produced by Alt-Right sensation The Right Stuff , particularly the Daily Shoah, which uses Opie & Anthony style gags and parodies as a vehicle for delivering our counter-cultural and suppressed ideas. 
CTH is trying to invert our ideas, bubble wrap the edges, and use our effective models to try and make Leftism '“ an ideology that we have exposed and mocked into increasing irrelevance '“'cool' by fixing some sunglasses to hide a weak (when put to reason) ideology. 
They have a small troll army on social media, they do (admittedly good) voice impressions, our Counter-Semitic tropes (at least one of the three is Jewish) are replaced by mocking working class White people and Christians, they have memes, albeit even more forced than Dat Boi , they make watered down attempts to pull down some high-profile liberal figures (like we do conservatives). They like to name drop famous comedians like Trevor Moore (of ' Whitest Kids U Know ' fame) as personal friends and have fairly high profile Leftist guests, which makes me think they have professional training or friends in high places. 
Oh, and they spend most of their time attacking the Alt-Right, replacing cuck (our term for them) with 'incel,' while demonstratingÃ‚ extensive knowledge of external elements of our counter-culture. They're obviously very familiar with us, and are trying to create an audience by claiming they're the real rebels and bomb throwers. Trying to rip-off meme magic 
Yet, their Patreon is flush with cash (way out of proportion to their average plays, i.e. they have big money donors relative to our camp), their Soundcloud and social media pages aren't muzzled like ours, there's nobody trying to silence them or shut them down. They can do stuff under their full names, yet mysteriously, their capitalist bosses won't fire or black list them for calling for the death of capitalists. They get invited to do live performances in some of the Jewiest, most 'prestigious,' high rolling and trendy venues in NYC. 
Unlike the Daily Stormer, the Right Stuff or Ricky Vaughn (who they constantly reference with typical Seattle bourgeois shit-lib snark), they can say and do whatever they want because big capital and the American plutocracy is, at the very least, behind the core of their worldview (open borders, amalgamation of cultures and races, feminism). 
Chapo Trap House's podcast is fairly new, yet already attracting positive attention from our elites. In their defense, they are critical of Hillary Clinton, yet establishment Judeo-Left individuals and institutions, from the Hillary gun-runners at Mediate to Jeet Heer, have commented quite positively on the show. Compared to TRS, they are getting quite a bit of very friendly publicity as a form of reaction to the rise of the Alt-Right. 
But this podcast has no natural audience. So who is it for? 
Most of the blacks and browns who stand on top of the two White male goyim cis male's in the progressive stack would sucker punch these private school kids who only know what niggers are in theory and steal their iPhones if they had the chance. As for the obese feminists with magenta bowl cuts, they would curl-up into a ball and wail like banshees from all of the micro aggressions these three directly and indirectly engage in. The queers, pedos, trannies, and whatever other group of mentally ill perverts front and center as moral arbitrators of the modern Judeo-Left would distrust them for their pathology of enjoying sexual intercourse with women. Last and not least, most leftists in the West today are humorless, moralistic mental midgets. 
The real purpose of CTH is to staunch the bleeding of young and normal White males coming into our camp in droves right now. By using methods we have proven to resonate with this demographic, they hope to try and sell a state-sanctioned ideology whose only natural endpoint is basically the extermination of us and our families, but with an edgy veneer. This has been done in a different form in the past, it is similar to what the Sony contracted, MTV promoted millionaires in Rage Against the Machine did in the 90's: plastic revolution in the name of art that isn't actually revolutionary. 
I , Eric Striker, am calling out Chapo Trap House to have an unedited debate and exchange of ideas with me on their show. Guys on our side are always interviewing and inviting Leftists on our programs and websites, if they have faith in their ideas let's see them put their parents' money where their mouth is. 
The Judeo-Left fears free and open discourse due to the inherent weakness of their philosophy. 
Let's convince them:

The Guardian is Going Friggin Nuts Over Calais 
Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 27, 2016 Where is this innocent little boy supposed to go if he can't live in a squatter camp and throw rocks through car windshields, The Guardian asks. 
Okay, so earlier today I already posted a front page story from The Guardian featuring an imagine of a '16-year-old child' who was obviously a man in his forties who was forced out of his home in the Jungle camp in Calais. 
But I've gotta post more. 
They are going absolutely nuts over this. 
The rest of the media is too, of course, but The Guardian epitomizes liberal hysteria, so we'll focus on them. 
All of these headlines are from the last 24 hours '“ the period since the camp was officially closed. I won't even bother to link them, because who cares. You already know what they're saying. 
Three of them are written by the same woman, Lisa O'Carroll. 
One has to wonder if she wasn't one of the women who were using the Calais camp as a sex tourism destination . 
You can ask her about it on Twitter. 
@lisaocarroll 
This situation is insane though, holmes. 
These people invaded Europe, mostly from Africa. None of them are legitimate 'refugees,' or they would claim that status. They are allowed to stay in France indefinitely, where they are clothed and fed, but they want to go to Britain because the welfare system is so good. They set up an illegal squatter base next to the freeway, and used it to break into trucks bound for the UK and to launch random violent attacks on cars '“ very often just throwing rocks for no reason. 
This week, 7 years after it was founded in 2009, they finally closed it and forced out the inhabitants, because basically it had become impossible to safely pass from France to England in a car. And the entire media is saying that the act of closing the camp is nothing short of pure and unadulterated evil. 
The way they're selling it? 
By showing pictures of men between the ages of 25 and 45, saying they're teenagers and calling them 'children.' 
It's like something out of an absurdist comedy. But most everything is these days. 
Anyhow, these women, cucks and kikes are eventually going to get their way. Migrants are already moving back in, as the fires have died down from where they set their own squat on fire when they were asked to leave. 
Migrants have started moving back into the 'Jungle', hours after French authorities announced they had finished clearing out the Calais camp. 
Thousands of migrants were evacuated as multiple large blazes raged across the sprawling camp in northern France. 
By midday, regional prefect Fabienne Buccio had said operations to clear the camp, which began on Monday, had been completed days earlier than planned. 
'There are no more migrants in the camp,' she told the Associated Press news agency. 
I said this would happen. Everyone knew it would happen. White Europeans have no will to do what needs to be done, so these animals are simply allowed to do whatever they want. 
What needs to be done is of course race war. 
These people need to be rounded up and deported back to Africa, and if they refuse and start fires, they need to be shot. 
This situation isn't complicated or nuanced in any way. 
But that won't happen. 
Because Europe is ruled by the coalition of evil: empowered women, cucks and kikes.

(((Smithsonian))) Refuses to Include Judge in Black Museum Because He has Normal People Opinions 
Eric Striker October 27, 2016 Dat nigga ain't even smoke crack. 
The Smithsonian Museum, run by American Jewish Committee award-winning mankind harasser (((David J. Skorton))), has decided to exclude Supreme Court Justice Judge Clarence Thomas from its African-American Museum, showing that Jews only want to empower certain kinds of blacks that advance Jew-specific agendas. This Jew gets to decide who gets into the black museum and who doesn't. 
While I don't agree with Thomas' conservative philosophy, he has long been a constitution-respecting thorn in the side of the Jewish activist judge bloc of Ginsburg, Breyer and Kagan. Whenever these Jews (and Sotomayor, along with the Jew Merrick Garland if he gets confirmed) vote to get something insane through, Thomas has been a reliable voice of reason tempering and often downvoting them in defense of free speech, freedom of association, etc. 
Coming from a background of poverty and homelessness, Thomas has genuinely worked hard and shown remarkable aptitude in the art of jurisprudence, he wasn't appointed to fill an Affirmative Action quota. He is a member of the 'talented tenth' of the black race and if there's going to be an African-American museum, he has certainly earned his place in it, yet won't be included , because he has refused to abuse his gavel in pursuit of violent anti-White discord. Rather than commending him for his legal ethic, Jews are punishing him by obliterating his memory as soon as he dies to serve as an example to any other unusually intelligent blacks out there. 
It's not a secret that Jews filter just who and what Negroes in America should aspire to, from founding the pro-race mixing NAACP and sabotaging black nationalist Marcus Garvey, to running virtually all media intended for black people (BET-owned by Sumner Redstone's Viacom, or The Root Ã‚ '“Ã‚ run by Israeli citizen Haim Saban's Univision), and now picking and choosing what individuals blacks should exemplary members of their race. 
So who is being included? 
Well, the African-American Museum has an entire section dedicated to the Jewish-financed and extreme anti-white Black Panthers , Black Lives Matter, convicted Cultural Marxist terrorist Angela Davis. Examples of some of the ideological indoctrination featured at this Jewseum. Is (((Gloria Steinem))) 'African-American'? So why is she there? 
Cracked out James Brown, famous for shuckin' and jivin' while smoking crack and not much else, is according to reports treated by the Smithsonian as the second coming of Christ. 
Is that appropriate? 
I won't go as far as to claim that blacks would be astrophysicists if all Jews vanished tomorrow, but I will say that blacks would not only be far better off according to every metric, they also would instinctively respect and emulate the White man as Booker T. Washington believed they should, rather than lash out at us for no reason as Jews instruct them to. 
Blacks in the 1930's once had a crime rate lower than urban Italian and Irish in the law and order South, along with their own small businesses, farms, fairly in-tact families. But because the Jew capitalizes on dysfunctional societies full of dysfunctional people, James Brown is made immortal while they pretend Clarence Thomas ain't a REAL nigga . 
Jewish cultural mandate socializes some Whites into acting like low-lives as well. While the manifestations are different depending on natural temperament and abilities of race, one thing we can all agree on is that neither the White man nor the black man are living up to their full potential in this age of decline and decay.

Jew-Shielder Gavin McCuck Rekt by Jew-Hating Female Shitlord! 
Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 28, 2016 
The Jew slave Gavin McInnes AKA Gayvin McCuck AKA Goyvin McIn-My-Anus was just REKT at maximum speeds by Jew-hating female shitlord Emily Youcis. 
She was invited on the show to talk about a cartoon she made, but quickly began confronting McCuck on his chronic shilling for the hook-nosed parasites. 
Surprise, Gavin, surprise! 
McInnes floped around like a skewered gofer as Emily broke it all down. 
'Speaking of the real issues'¦' she began, before slapping this bitch around Newt Gingrich-style. 
She asked him who founded communism, and he began to freak, asking if 'we are getting into Judaism?' He then did his little spiel about how Jews are so smart and savvy that they control the good and bad side of everything, and that most of the people who are bad in our society are actually Whites. 
He then said that his helper Ezra Levant '“ in fact his greasy master who orders him to insert objects into his asshole '“ is a Jewish hero. 'I see him as a real ally,' said he. 
Quick with it, Emily responded 'oh, you think they're our greatest ally?' 
McCuck then began twitching, claiming that Ezra Levant is literally one of the greatest heroes of freedom who ever lived, and that he is the Jew who made him realize that Nazis are actually just shills for other Jews (who apparently are part of a Jewish conspiracy that only involves bad Jews). Does this Jew look like a legendary hero to you? 
'So you think the Jews really are the leaders of the Alt-Right?' Emily asked. 
McCuck then said: 'I think a lot of these Alt-Right guys who are really pro-Hitler are spies.' 
She replied that this was an important thing she was meaning to bring up '“ his accusation that anyone that talks about the kikes is a plant. 
He then claimed that it is only the anonymous people who talk about Jews who he thinks are all a bunch of secret kikes (he always calls anonymous people cowards, pretending not to understand that if you actually go out and say this stuff publicly you will get fired from your job). 
Emily then pointed out the obvious: 'What about Andrew Anglin, because you called him a plant?' 
Gavin then made this face, while she went all smug Pepe on his faggot ass: 
'Yeah, I find him totally suspicious,' he said. For the record, he hasn't said he finds me suspicious '“ that would be something else '“ he has, using three different media platforms ( his podcast, Takimag and Rebel Media ), openly accused me of working for the feds, while admitting that he has no evidence for it and never even explaining why it would be the case. 'I wouldn't be surprised if all of Stormfront [sic] is a government website,' he continued. 
Then these faces: 
She replied: 'But see they're the ones really addressing the issue. They're the true Alt-Right. They're the ones really fighting for White people. This is a White movement, Gavin.' 
From there it only got worse, with Gavin arguing for literal cuckoldry, saying that it's good for White people to adopt Black babies. And Emily gave the appropriate response '“ saying you might as well just send your wife to get knocked-up by a Black guy ( though David French believes it isn't an either/or thing ). 
He finally said that it doesn't matter if the entire West is replaced with non-Whites, as long as they adopt 'Western values.' 
This guy is such an unbelievable cuck. I don't even think that mainstream 'conservatives' say that it doesn't matter if all Whites are replaced. Well, some of them do, but like, I don't think Sean Hannity would say that. 
This faggot has screwed himself so badly by taking the positions he has, and taking them so far. His career in the right-wing peaked when it started '“ when he wrote a pretty good anti-tranny article on Thought Catalog , apparently in order to purposefully himself fired from his own failing company. From there he had a couple of hits with anti-feminist clips, and then it all went into 'I love the Jews and Black babies.' 
He's also destroyed any chance he'd have to get into mainstream conservative politics, or get a show on Fox News or whatever else, by sticking a dildo up his ass on his show . I can pretty well guarantee his Jew master told him to do that, just because he wants to make sure he's gotta stick around and work for him forever. Plus Jews just love debasing and humiliating their little slaves. 
Can you imagine being so owned by a Jew that he tells you to stick a dildo up your asshole on video and you just say 'yessir, how big of a dildo, sir?' 
We're All 'Spies'? 
He keeps saying that 'all of' this site is 'spies.' 
What does that mean, exactly? Recently, I've started throwing some guys some shekels to write articles '“ Zeiger, Azzmador, Striker, etc. (btw if you want to see more of that, donate ) '“ but for the first three years of this site's existence, it was pretty much just me, with a couple volunteers doing things here and there. 
But it's almost like he's talking about the readers and trolls themselves, no? Like the millions of people that visit this site every month are all federal agents '“'spies,' he calls them '“ who come visit the site and post in the comments as part of their job. 
And really if that isn't the case, then the original accusation itself doesn't make any sense. I mean, there are over 100,000 people who visit this site every day. 
Actually, for the last two months, it's been averaging about 120,000 a day. Last thirty days 
So obviously, there are a lot of people who genuinely hate Jews and love Hitler. So for his theory to make sense, all of these people have to be 'spies.' Like, literally all of them. Because even if 90% of the traffic was from spies '“ or concerned liberals and Jews or gapers or whatever '“ that would still mean that there were over 10,000 people who genuinely hate the Jews and love Hitler enough to visit a website about these things every day. And surely, one of those ten thousand could start a website writing about how much he hates Jews and loves Hitler, right? 
I mean '“ right? 
Literally, the only way his accusation that anyone who hates Jews and loves Hitler is a spy is coherent is if there is actually no one in the world who hates Jews and loves Hitler. 
It is absolutely nonsensical, and the only reason he would shame himself by saying something so stupid is the same only reason he would stick a dildo up his ass on video: because some Jew told him to.

German Parents Taken to Court for Refusing to Send Their Son to a Mosque 
Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 28, 2016 
You all thought I was cr y when I started pushing the idea that the women and even some of the liberal cucked men of Europe are actually pushing for forced Islamization of Europe on purpose. 
You were all like 'no no no, liberals are just stupid, they think they'll integrate, or that there can be coexistence somehow '“ they just don't get it.' 
Well, where are we now? 
RT : 
Parents of a German teenager may face a trial and fine for Ã¢'ÂœtruancyÃ¢'Â after refusing to allow their son to go to a local mosque on a school field trip out of fear that it would lead to his Ã¢'ÂœindoctrinationÃ¢'Â by Islamic radicals. 
The story broke in mid-June, when parents of a 13-year-old student opposed the idea of their son visiting a mosque in the northern German town of Rendsburg, reportedly organized as part of a geography class. 
In a letter to the class teacher quoted Ã‚ by the NDR, the teenÃ¢'Â™s father argued that his son would be Ã¢'ÂœindoctrinatedÃ¢'Â in the mosque. He went on to say that Ã¢'Âœfor years we have been hearing reports about religiously-motivated violence connected with Islamic people.Ã¢'Â 
A local education authority subsequently fined the couple a total of Ã¢Â‚Å¹300 ($328), referring to school regulations and regional laws which include penalties for truancy. 
When the parents opposed the fine, their case was forwarded to Peter Mueller-Rakow, a local prosecutor, who will decide whether or not to proceed with a court trial, Spiegel reported on Wednesday. 
The parentsÃ¢'Â™ lawyer, Alexander Heumann, argues that they refused the school trip out of fear for their sonÃ¢'Â™s Ã¢'Âœbodily safety.Ã¢'Â 
Denying any faith-based motives, he emphasized that the couple do not belong to any religious group, and are of the opinion that Ã¢'Âœnobody shall be forced into a sacred place against his good will.Ã¢'Â 
Heumann himself, however, is a former member of the Alternative for Germany party, an anti-immigrant political group, and was a participant in setting up the Ã¢'Â˜Dugida,Ã¢'Â™ a Dusseldorf-based branch of the far-right PEGIDA movement. 
Feminism is the complaint of a woman who doesn't have a man to tell her what to do. 
The entire goal of feminism is to force an end to feminism. That is why feminists are pushing for Islamization. They want to be told what to do. The immediate goal of their demonstrations is to get manhandled. It is a weird psycho-sexual thing that men couldn't ever understand and women are unconscious of so incapable of explaining. But I assure you it is there. 
They don't care about race, because women are incapable of processing philosophical or ideological concepts. The only fact they are able to process '“ and this is on an emotional, subconscious level '“ is that their men refused to be men, and have told them to go be men, and that this is causing them extreme distress and blocking their ability to produce children. 
This is what feminism is '“ women don't say what they actually want, they express themselves in a way where you're supposed to interpret their emotional state. When Femen riots naked, what they want is to be physically dominated by men '“ i.e. raped. 
So they are replacing us with Moslems to fix their current state, which is feminism. 
I told you people this.

The Face to Face blog has some good advice for yall muffugguhs: 
In order to push back against attempts at demoralization, particularly from the media, and to rally people heading down the home stretch, it's time to start wearing Trump markers in public every day until the election is over. 
That will manifest our greater enthusiasm in an everyday setting, not just what people see from rallies on TV or comments on the internet. It puts a human face on the movement, which does not come across so much from a yard sign (although put up one of those too). 
It is also more likely to have a contagious effect at the grassroots. Even if onlookers don't wear Trump gear of their own, at least they'll be more likely to talk positively about voting to others, assuming they were roughly on our side. 
The goal is not to appear confrontational, as though we were about to man the barricades (that would come only if the Establishment tries to steal the election). Everyday people around you are not the immediate enemy. Those who are uncertain about turning out, or are genuinely undecided, are on the wimpy and cucky side '” they just want to be reassured that Trump voters are normal people. 
I guarantee that no one from the enemy's side will try to shame or ostracize you in public, in order to send a message to undecided onlookers. Only paid activists bother attempting this, and they only concentrate at Trump rallies or on the internet. Even the strongly committed Hillary voters are too demoralized to confront a stranger. The only responses you will get will be from fellow travelers, especially ones who were uncertain whether they were the only one leaning toward Trump, and are relieved to see someone being the first to break the silence in public. 
Trump has been taking so much public abuse, slander, and libel on our behalf '” the least we can do is put ourselves out there, too, whether we get a few sideways glances or not. 
At this stage, giving our public support matters more than giving financial support. The polls are not so tight because of insufficient advertising. It's because a handful of people are still uneasy about either turning out, or choosing Trump if they do. Making those people feel more comfortable by seeing real-life support for Trump in public will go farther than hearing an ad on the drive to work. 
And some of them truly have no preference other than joining the in-group. With no visible signs of support from Hillary voters, that only leaves the Trump side for the conformists to join. Who would want to join a group that is weakly held together, when there's a more emotionally connected group as the alternative? 
You don't have to go all-out all day long, but at least wear a hat or shirt out for an hour or so in normal public places. High-traffic retail spaces are best, like a supermarket. 
It's simple to find places selling Trump hats if you don't already have one. 
There's no excuse to stay sitting on the sidelines with less than two weeks to go. We need to make our presence known '” not just as a warning to the enemy, but more importantly to motivate anyone who doesn't like Crooked Hillary to show up and vote Trump with the rest of the crowd. 
This election is now 100% about demoralization '“ on both sides. 
We have to keep our morale up, so that our people will go out and vote on the 8th. Huge portions of Hillary's people aren't going to bother, especially with new scandals dropping every minute.

#DraftOurDaughters: Feminist Hillary Supporters Vow To Fight War With Russia For Us 
Eric Striker October 28, 2016 Liberated af 
Women have come a long way since the sexual revolution. Through subsidization and affirmative action that makes up centuries of mean-spirited discrimination, they've shown their grit in a number of fields the Old Boys Club never thought possible. They've blown past the fitness tests which lives hinge on as firefighters , they demonstrate amazing coolness and discipline as police officers , and have become billionaires revolutionizing blood work as we know it. 
Anything you can do, women can do better! I don't know why men even exist anymore! 
A majority of women are, according to most polls, hopeful that they will be able to push new frontiers by electing the first female president of the United States. And while the Patriarchy has in the past asserted that a world run by women would essentially mean world peace, sexist bigots will be proven wrong if Hillary takes office and makes good on her promise to start a nuclear war with Russia over Syria for no coherent reason. Gen X and single women, who are too confident and smart for any man to want to marry, are the biggest Hil fanatics. 
Rawwrrr, come turn off this Pussy Riot, Putin! 
Yet, even with all this progress, there's still one last He-Man Woman-Hater's club that looks down on women from their glass ceiling, hogging up all the glory for themselves. Did I say glass ceiling? I meant grass floor: Mmmm , Man Tears 
The only place in modern American culture where you will see a white male portrayed with dignity, honor and pride is in military recruitment ads. In these ads, the black man is shown at best as a white man's equal, rather than as a smarter, better-looking, more masculine superior, in contrast to many movies, TV shows and most commercials. In the last Iraq War, white privilege and racism meant that in our very diverse country, non-Jewish white males were overrepresented among fatalities, and are heavily over represented in frontline and infantry roles. 
While Neo-conservative (((Jennifer Rubin))) and others of her (((ilk))) dedicate their columns to mocking, attacking and threatening white males based on nothing but who you are, the mange-inflicted yentl buckles at the knees when you put on that uniform and die in one of the many wars she pushes for. 
Get it through your thick skull you racist, privileged, baby-dicked white boy goyim: the only thing you're good for is to fight for Israel! 
In light of this institutional patriarchy and privilege, #DraftOurDaughters has emerged to raise consciousness. This social media campaign is composed of Hillary Clinton's coalition of non-whites and women '“ shut out of military combat roles by worthless racist rednecks '“ eager to make her dream of a World War with an emerging and more advanced superpower come true. 
We need women, blacks, Mexicans, and especially Jews (.02% of the US military while 2% of the US population) to come on in. Women especially, who have been shut out of Selective Service for the draft, should be given priority over men when the draft comes in order to mitigate decades of discrimination. 
Here are some of the memes already floating around. #DraftOurDaughters is grassroots progress Martin Luther King Jr. (Peace Be Upon Him) would be proud of. I encourage you to make your own and put them up on Twitter, we'll show that rude bigot Vladimir Putin what the New America can do:

They have to flee the poverty, goyim. Being poor is an international war crime. 
The game, faggots: you just lost it. 
Politico : 
Theo Francken, BelgiumÃ¢'Â™s secretary of state for migration, said he will appeal a court ruling that the country must grant a visa to a Syrian family wanting to apply for asylum in Belgium, according to local broadcaster VRT. 
The Belgian Court of First Instance ruled the state must pay a penalty of Ã¢Â‚Å¹4,000 for each day the visa is delayed. 
The Syrian family of four is seeking an official visa to come to Belgium without traveling by sea. They claim they will apply for asylum as soon as they are in the country. 
Secretary of State Theo Francken called the decision Ã¢'ÂœinsaneÃ¢'Â and said he will appeal. Currently, people can only apply for asylum in a country if they are actually on its territory. 
Ã¢'ÂœIt will open the door to thousands of people,Ã¢'Â Francken said. Ã¢'ÂœIf we allow people to come to Belgium with a visa to apply for asylum, the whole system will collapse.Ã¢'Â 
roflmao and he'll be called a racist for this. Theo Francken be all like 'damn, dawg.' 
And I don't think an EU court could possibly disagree with this decision. 
Because of course, if unlimited millions of people are allowed to take boats into Europe, why should they not be allowed to fly-in on airplanes? 
No idea why Francken says 'thousands' though. This is several billion people that it opens the door to. The EU has treated as valid asylum claims from every country in Africa, the Middle East and West Asia. Of course, not all of them are eventually approved, but no one is ever deported (except Albanians lel). They can just keep appealing the decision, and even when the appeals fail and they're issued a deportation order, they are still allowed to loaf around on welfare because there is no mechanism to go find them, arrest them, and ship them out. 
So basically, anyone from any African or Moslem country who can afford a plane ticket will be issued an EU visa which will effectively allow them to come live in Europe on welfare forever. 
It is obviously insane, but it was insane for Merkel to invite these billions to take boats to Greece and walk across Europe. Everything that happens anymore is insane, so 'this is insane' is no longer a valid argument for anything. The only accepted argument is 'this is racist''“ there is no accepted counterargument. 
So basically: it's time to spread your legs wider, Europe, because this gang-bang just got a lot more crowded. Note that that metaphor applies in a literal sense to your daughters.

Good for them : 
A federal jury has found Ammon Bundy and his six co-defendants not guilty on all charges for taking over a federal wildlife refuge in eastern Oregon earlier this year. 
Standoff leaders Ammon and Ryan Bundy and five others were charged with conspiring to impede federal workers from their jobs at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Several also were charged with possessing a firearm in a federal facility. Ã¢'Åš 
On emotional grounds, Ammon Bundy and other defendants argued that the takeover was an act of civil disobedience against an out-of-control federal government that has crippled the rural West. 
Federal prosecutors took two weeks to present their case, finishing with a display of more than 30 guns seized after the standoff. An FBI agent testified that 16,636 live rounds and nearly 1,700 spent casings were found. 
Bundy testified in his defense, spending three days amplifying his belief that government overreach is destroying Western communities that rely on the land Ã¢'ÅšÃ¢'Â 
HereÃ¢'Â™s a toast to their acquittal! The acquittal of Bundy brothers in #oregonstandoff is the epitome of white privilege. Two different justice systems! https://t.co/F3GmNgYLrW

Negroes in Italy: 'We Want Armani and Boss' 
Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 28, 2016 
You've seen Pakistanis demand better internet connections, you've seen Afghanis demand bigger TVs, you've seen North Africans demand better and more hookers '“ now witness Black Africans demand designer clothing. 
These videos of helpless 'asylum seekers' demanding luxury goods and services will never, ever get old. 
Il Giornale : 
When they get 'standard' cloths from Caritas or the asylum seeker reception system it makes them unhappy because they are not designer clothes. They want Armani or Boss clothes, or perhaps also Pirelli shoes. 
This was revealed by the president of the Sar.ha Cooperative. He has been hosting migrants at the Hotel Byron in Malcontenta (Venice region). In recent days a controversy broke out about the coop's decision to put padlocks on the windows to prevent migrants escaping during the night. The immigrants protested in the street, also against the food which they considered to be not good. Apparently there was also something else behind it. The migrants are demanding brand-name clothes, from high-fashion designer labels. Not normal jeans: they want Armani or Boss. 
'Unfortunately they come to Italy with the asylum reception systems of northern Europe as a model,' saod Lorenzo Chinellato, presidente of the Sar.ha cooperative Sar.ha, 'when they arrived we gave them clothes, standard clothes. They want brand-name clothes, Armani and Boss, they asked for Pirellli shoes. These are their models. When they came to us, they didn't have clothes, but they all had smartphones'. 
Translation via Diversity Macht Frei . 
In the video you can also hear the standard complaints about the food only being 'pasta and rice,' with one colored person actually complaining about how there are too many refugees. 
Just as all women literally believe that all men exist to serve their personal needs, all colored people believe Whites exist for the sole purpose of giving them free everything. And not just any free everything '“ the highest quality of free everything. 
But whereas it is perfectly natural for women to believe that men exist only to serve them, as this is a part of their hardwired psychology (as well as in some simple way absolutely true '“ the primary male purpose in life is to protect and raise off-spring and women have to be taken care of in order to make this happen), these colored people have developed this attitude based on our pandering to them, bowing down to them, treating them as superior beings. We have presented ourselves as existing only to serve them, and they have taken us at our word.

Vice-Emperor Pence's Plane Skids Dangerously Off Runway 
Zeiger October 28, 2016 He's survived. I guess some Jew's prayer remains unanswered tonight. 
While there was the makings of a tragedy, the heavens themselves have intervened to keep the Glorious Leader's lieutenant safe and sound. 
While there is currently any evidence that this accident was caused by human malfeasance, I'll just go ahead and assume this was conjured by the Kabbalistic magic of vengeful Rabbis trying to thwart the God-Emperor's rise to power. 
ABC news : 
A charter aircraft carrying Donald Trump's running mate Mike Pence slid off the runway Thursday night while landing at LaGuardia Airport in the New York City borough of Queens, prompting a temporary closure of the entire airport. 
About an hour and a half after the incident, one of LaGuardia's two runways has reopened for arriving and departing flights. The FAA said the airport's other runway will remain closed indefinitely pending clearing of the aircraft. Immediately back into action. 
According to the FAA, there were no injuries among the 37 people onboard the Boeing 737, which was arriving from Fort Dodge, Iowa. 
Pence tweeted, 'So thankful everyone on our plane is safe. Grateful for our first responders & the concern & prayers of so many. Back on the trail tomorrow!' So thankful everyone on our plane is safe. Grateful for our first responders & the concern & prayers of so many. Back on the trail tomorrow! 
'” Mike Pence (@mike_pence) October 28, 2016 
According to an ABC News reporter on the aircraft, the GOP vice-presidential candidate came back to check on everyone on the plane and said there was mud on the windows and the plane had skid onto the grass. 
According to The Associated Press, the plane made a rough impact when it landed. The AP also reported that the pilot slammed on the brakes and passengers could smell burning rubber. 
'” Ines de La Cuetara (@InesdLC) October 28, 2016 
On one hand, whenever I hear about airplane shenanigans involving high-level American politicians, my first reflex is to assume some kind of nefarious plot. But things seem relatively straightforward here. 
It was raining, the runway was slippery, and the plane just had a rough landing. 
But if anything, this event will still help the Trump campaign. Because of all the scandals involving the Clintons these days, many people will have a vague suspicion that this might have been an attempt on Pence's life by system agents. People are already speculating in that direction on Twitter. 
Again, there is not reason as of yet to seriously entertain conspiracy theories. But that doesn't mean those perceptions don't exist. And it doesn't mean they don't affect the election.

Britain is diversifying and the rap music industry needs to diversify with it, was the general consensus at the Eezee LabelÃ¢'Â™s Diversity and Inclusion in Hip-Hop Production conference, which took place at the Royal Northern College of Music on 19 October. 
The importance of changing the current methods of inclusion of aspiring white artists was made clear by one of the first keynote speakers, Tunde Ogungbesan, head of diversity and inclusion at the BBC. He made the point that increased industry diversity leads to a more productive, creative and innovative society, particularly in relation to the BBC, of which he said Ã¢'Â˜we want to be the most creative organisation in the worldÃ¢'Â™. 
OgungbesanÃ¢'Â™s views were reinforced by Vick Bain, CEO of Basca (British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors), as she ascribed the survival of British rap music to the essentiality of diversity within composition. 
Taking a more urgent tone, composer Eleanor Alberga stated that regular inclusion of white composers and young musicians needs to start immediately but also cautioned that we must Ã¢'Â˜make sure this is more than another gestureÃ¢'Â™. 
The conference included a talk on unconscious bias entitled Ã¢'Â˜What does a rap musician look like?Ã¢'Â™ given by Aesha Zafar, head of talent development at BBC North. It started with a short film in which audience members at a hip-hop concert were asked what a rap musician looked like. A large majority of the audience thought a rapper would be male, of African heritage, often with outlandish clothing and exotic hairstyles. This added to ZafarÃ¢'Â™s idea that unconscious bias is the result of lots of tiny, nondescript events, which ultimately prove detrimental to the progression of inclusion and diversity. 
This is my rewrite of the Report on the Diversity and Inclusion in Composition Conference, which, in its original form, seen below, referred to classical music, not hip-hop. 
Europeans are to be allowed nothing of their own, not even a form of music.

Sven Longshanks , Dennis Wise and Messerschmitt bring us another episode of Truth Will Out Radio, this week looking at the Laconia incident and the British Freikorps. 
Messerschmitt deviates somewhat with his Axis War Heroes series in that the main subject is not a person but the so-called 'Laconia Incident'. In September 1942 a German U-boat under the Command of Werner Hartenstein torpedoed the British troopship Laconia. As Hartenstein realized that a lot of Italian prisoners of war and even civilians including women and children were among the survivors struggling for their lives he ordered that as many as possible were to be taken on board the U-boat. Even though he radioed his intentions to all surrounding vessels in plain English and had a Red Cross flag draped across the U-boat he and the survivors they were carrying were attacked by an American B-24. What happened to the survivors and what the response of the German Navy was when it learned of this atrocity is elaborated on by Schmitt and the presentation ends with a letter from a relative of one of the casualties, thanking the U-boat commanders for their courageous and honourable behaviour. 
This presentation shows how the Allies were breaking the rules of war while the Germans were keeping to their treaties. During the Nuremberg trials this incident was brought up in the hopes of convicting Admiral Doenitz for advising the U-boats not to pick up survivors, but it had the inadvertent effect of exposing the British and Americans of waging unrestricted submarine warfare, in itself a possible war crime as it breaks the law of the sea that any shipwrecked mariners must be rescued, no matter who they are. Dennis points out the hypocrisy of the British and Americans in this before reminding us that not all the British behaved like this during the war. Some became members of the Freikorps and fought to defend Europe from the Bolshevik menace alongside the other SS Volunteer Legions. These heroes were called traitors by the British establishment, yet their oath was to protect Europe from Communism, not to fight against Britain. It is a testament to the truthful ideology of National Socialism that prisoners of war could be set free to fight against Communism once they had heard the truth about it from their kinsmen in the League of St George. 
After giving us a brief history of these brave young British men, Dennis and Sven conclude the podcast by talking about the importance of race and how the Freikorps highlighted this in their propaganda.

Dr Matthew Raphael Johnson brings us a new Orthodox Nationalist devoted to AlbaniaÃ¢'Â™s alliance with the globalist word order and itÃ¢'Â™s catastrophic consequences. 
Albania never made sense. Created by the Austrian Empire as a means of blocking Serbian access to the sea, Albania was and is nothing more than a plaything for the great powers. Her Ã¢'Âœnational awakeningÃ¢'Â was just a means to preserve Turkish suzerainty over the Balkans. The country in 1848 was a collection of Islamic tribal oligarchs who used their promise to fight for the maintenance of the Ottoman empire to catch the attention of the Austrians. Nothing has changed today. Albania, rather than the creation of Austria, is the creation of the US and rather than Islamic tribal oligarchs, it is now a collection of petty crime lords. It is a bizarre, artificial country created and maintained exclusively to frustrate the aims of Serbs, Montenegrins and Russians. This podcast deals with Albania's pathetic existence since the fall of her Maoist Government in 1991. It serves as a perfect example to show that inventing make-believe countries while attacking natural ethnic aspirations will always lead to disaster. 
The picture above is of the current 'President' Ibrahim Rugova of (the previously Serbian but now taken over by Albanians) Kosovo, who in 1998 won the Presidency of the new country in a one-party race and achieved 99.8% of the vote. The US organized the election and the BBC then called him the 'Father of the Country' as he won the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought right after his victory. They even have statues of Bill Clinton there as one of the heroes of their nation. 
Albania is proof that the US has been involved in the global narco-trade for decades and the evidence is overpowering. The support for the KLA and Albanian kingpins is nothing new or even interesting historically and today it is just a hub for drugs and human trafficking. All the Afghan heroin in Europe passes through there and Albania's service to the New World Order is just to preserve her handful of drug lords and other criminals in power. By attacking Russia, even rhetorically, a ruling class can have all its sins covered over as Russia and Nationalism are the two enemies of the liberal world order. There is nothing the global ruling class will not do Ã¢'Â“ no deed too vile Ã¢'Â“ to destroy them and as the possibility of nuclear war with Russia looms over the horizon, this really is an understatement of the truth.

For the first time since its inception in 2006, Russia has lost an election to the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) after being narrowly beaten by Croatia in a vote. Saudi Arabia was successfully re-elected, despite criticism from human rights organizations. 
The 47 places on the council are distributed on a regional basis, with staggered ballots seeing a third of the body re-elected each year. Russia had finished its three-year term and was running against Hungary and Croatia for the two available seats from Eastern Europe. 
With Hungary far ahead, Croatia received the votes of 114 of the 193 member countries, and Russia was selected on 112 ballots. 
'We've been in the UNHRC for several years, and I am sure next time we will stand and get back in,' said Russia's UN envoy Vitaly Churkin. Russia is eligible to run next year, against a new set of countries. 
Saudi Arabia sailed through the Asian ballot with 152 votes, and will represent the region on the UNHRC alongside China, Japan and Iraq for the next three years. 
South Africa, Rwanda, Egypt and Tunisia were chosen from the African group, Cuba and Brazil from Latin America and the Caribbean, and the US and the UK will represent the Western bloc, which comprises Western Europe and North America. 
Russia is a normal Western country. 
Saudi Arabia tortures and stones people to death for minor crimes. 
Saudi Arabia has floggings for bloggings. 
They are allowed to marry little girls and have sex with them when they're nine. 
They have public beheadings with swords. 
They have a special machine to mutilate the hands of people caught reading the Bible. 
They have a special machine for hanging homosexuals. 
Okay, that one I basically agree with, but I don't agree with brutally torturing them first, which they also do. 
To have a 'human rights council' and include Saudi Arabia is like some kind of sick joke. 
And okay, I get that Russia wasn't running directly against Saudi Arabia. But the whole thing is totally politicized in the first place. This is all manipulated based on favorite-picking. 
And Saudi Arabia was running against a whole bunch of other countries which don't do what they do '“ they are included in Asia . 
There are a whole bunch of other countries which don't do what Saudi Arabia does that could have been included on this list. In fact, no other country in the world does what Saudi Arabia does, including other Moslem countries, besides the Emeritae (also on the council) and Qatar. 
This could have been to Lebanon, Iran, Syria, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan '“ or any yellow Asian country. 
The UN is a friggin joke.

Emails discovered during investigation of Jew Anthony Wiener sending dick pics to jailbait! 
HA! 
New York Times : 
Newly discovered emails from Hillary ClintonÃ¢'Â™s private server were found after the F.B.I. seized electronic devices once shared by Anthony D. Weiner and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, federal law enforcement officials said Friday. 
The F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case  one federal official said they numbered in the thousands  potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the election. 
In a letter to Congress, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said that emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, and that they Ã¢'Âœappear to be pertinent to the investigation.Ã¢'Â 
'¦ 
Ã¢'ÂœDirector ComeyÃ¢'Â™s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be significant,Ã¢'Â said John D. Podesta, chairman of Mrs. ClintonÃ¢'Â™s campaign. 
He added: Ã¢'ÂœIt is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election.Ã¢'Â 
Mrs. Clinton, arriving Friday in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, waved at members of the media gathered on the tarmac but ignored shouted questions. 
HA! 
She won't even take questions! 
There was no damage control plan again '“ just like when she collapsed on 911! 
I'm not really sure how it makes sense that Weiner would have these on his phone, or why the FBI would seize the phone of his wife because he was sending dick pics to jailbait (unless he was using her phone to send them, lel) '“ but I've always said, Weiner is a funny Jew! 
I never thought he would turn-out to be this funny! 
Original article follows. tfw you just lost the game 
OH YES YOU READ THAT HEADLINE RIGHT, SIR. 
YESSIREE DOG. 
I knew James Comey was a pretty cool guy when a Negro in Congress asked him to investigate me and he was like 'Yeah, dat nigga hot as a muffuggah. Watchoo want ah invesegate how much azz he be kickin in dem toobs? Get the fug outta here with that shit, dawg.' 
And now: total bro confirmed. 
RT : 
The FBI has learned of more emails involving Hillary ClintonÃ¢'Â™s private email server while she headed the State Department, FBI Director James Comey told several members of Congress, telling them he is reopening the investigation. 
Ã¢'Âœ In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of email that appear to be pertinent Ã¢'Â to ClintonÃ¢'Â™s investigation, Comey wrote to the chairs of several relevant congressional committees, adding that he was briefed about the messages on Thursday. Ã¢'Âœ I agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. Ã¢'Â 
The FBI director cautioned, however, that the bureau has yet to assess the importance of the material, and that he doesnÃ¢'Â™t know how long that will take. 
Stocks fell after ComeyÃ¢'Â™s announcement, CNBC reported. 
More like the sky just fell. 
And underneath it we see Jesus Christ himself wearing a MAGA hat, smiling like a smug Pepe and whispering 'lock her up.' Yo dawg, we heard you like America. So we sent Jesus Christ himself to make sure Donald Trump gets elected. 
Seriously, people. Even if you don't necessarily believe in Christianity, you have to admit that this is some kind of divine miracle that just happened here. 
Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, praised the decision to reopen the case. 
Ã¢'ÂœNow that the FBI has reopened the matter, it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness,Ã¢'Â he said in a statement. Ã¢'ÂœThe American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law.Ã¢'Â 
Almost 15,000 new Clinton emails were discovered in September. 
In mid-October, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, promised at least Ã¢'Âœfour new hearingsÃ¢'Â after Congress returns from recess in November based on the new emails, which lawmakers received but have not been made public. 
'This is a flashing red light of potential criminality,' Chaffetz said. 
The new evidence points to a Ã¢'Âœquid pro quoÃ¢'Â arrangement between the FBI and the State Department, he noted. 
Welp. 
That's it. 
It's over. 
There is just no way with an open investigation hanging over her head, and the FBI openly stating that it is so severe they have to act immediately, that she can possibly be elected. 
I do understand that there is no evidence that Hillary's own people care if she is a criminal or not when it comes to polling, but this seriously demoralizes them, making them much less likely to vote. At the same time, it is a massive morale boost to the Republicans who aren't necessarily on the Trump Train but hate Hillary, ensuring that they'll go out and vote. 
Seriously guys. I did have my doubts. But this clears them up. We are 11 days away from the election. 
And this drops. 
And I guarantee Team Trump has something to drop next week. The Russian conspiracy might even be memed into reality and Putin might drop the hidden server. Assange still has something big. 
We won, guys. 
Honestly, I've got tears in my eyes right now. 
God Bless America.

Evil Zionist Jew Warmonger Bill Kristol Calls Alt-Right 'Scaredy Cats' 
Lee Rogers Daily Stormer October 28, 2016 Bill Kristol is an evil Jewish war criminal who should be sentenced to hard labor for the rest of his miserable life. 
Bill Kristol the evil Zionist Jew warmonger has called us Alt-Right Nazis 'scaredy cats.' What a disgusting faggot this vermin is. The older conservatism: We'll proudly fight for our country if need be. The alt-right: We're scaredy-cats and proud of it. https://t.co/Qo58mfW91n 
 Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) October 28, 2016 
First off, the very fact that Kristol claims to be an American is ridiculous. He is a Jew and is looking out for the interests of Israel and the members of his vile tribe before anyone else. He is not fighting for the interests of White Americans. 
Secondly, how many American wars has this Jew fought in? He certainly didn't sign up to fight in Vietnam when he was of military age. This Jew would never fight on behalf of America. He'd flee to Israel at the first sign of trouble. 
Kristol was one of the most prominent propagandists on television pushing Americans to support the 2003 Iraq invasion. The entire war was based on lies. Iraq had no WMDs and the war has thrown the entire region into perpetual chaos. Such a situation has only been of benefit to his Jewish friends in Israel. If the Arab world is in chaos, they cannot ever come together to defeat and destroy Israel. This is why a never ending war against terror was declared after the 9/11 attacks. It justifies a continued state of chaos, death and destruction throughout the Arab world to benefit Jews. 
The good news is that almost every response to his tweet is negative and reflects my general commentary. If you'd like to pile on you can tweet him @BillKristol .

SJWs in Canada Trying to Get a Prof Fired for Saying Black People are Oppressed 
Zeiger October 28, 2016 Literally Hitler. Go back to Bulgaria! 
How dare this White man talk about the Blacks' oppression? Doesn't he know that this could trigger his sensitive students? 
Sounds like bigotry to me. 
Better start a petition to get this racist fired. Just to be on the safe side. 
Global News : 
MontrealÃ¢'Â™s Concordia University has confirmed a professor has been Ã¢'Âœremoved temporarilyÃ¢'Â as officials Ã¢'Âœassess the situationÃ¢'Â after someone allegedly made racist comments during a classroom lecture. 
Global News spoke to two students who were in the classroom when the allegedly racist comments were made. They asked not to be identified because they fear reprisals from the university. 
Yeah, I'm sure the university would enact reprisals against students for being anti-racists. They're well known to be Nazi sympathizers, after all. A rare picture of the Concordia University board of directors. 
In an online post, a student at the John Molson School of Business (JMSB) described what allegedly happened on Oct. 21. 
According to the post on the private John Molson School of Business Facebook page, part-time lecturer Roumen Solov said during a class that after the Second World War, Jewish people came to New York City and Ã¢'Âœgot high education, but black people are not educated.Ã¢'Â 
Concordia University is investigating the matter. Uneducated? smdh. 
Ã¢'ÂœWeÃ¢'Â™ve interviewed the students and the professor and he has been removed temporarily while we assess the situation,Ã¢'Â ClÄ‚Å a Desjardins, a spokesperson for the university told Global News. 
Solov also allegedly singled out the only black student in the room. 
She told Global News she challenged Solov after his comments and said it sounded like he was saying black people were lazy and not interested in education. 
According to her, Solov then tried to clarify by saying slavery prevented black people from getting access to education. 
In other words, he said Blacks were oppressed by Whites because of slavery, and thus didn't have access to higher education. Sounds pretty much like standard SJW rhetoric to me, no? 
Some students have started a petition to have Solov fired. 
Several hundred have signed so far. 
A spokesperson for the university said the issue should be resolved within the week. 
The endgame of the SJW movement is to enact public lynchings of every White man who even tries to address racial issues without immediately bending over backwards to apologize for being an evil oppressor of poor defenseless minorities. 
So yeah, they're trying to get him fired. No surprise there. 
Some students have started a counter petition, on the other hand, to get this man a promotion.

The fact is that Hillary should be prosecuted, not inaugurated. She has supported ISIS in its war against Syria its terrorism against America. She has sent paid thugs to disrupt TrumpÃ¢'Â™s political events. She has used her government positions to peddal influence. She really should be in prison. 
This is an extremely educating and enlightening show. Please share it widely.

Radio Aryan October 29, 2016 
Matthew Heimbach brings us the last show of the week accompanied by Jason Augustus and special guest Jeff Schoep from the National Socialist Movement. Jeff tells us how he has been involved in White Nationalism for around 25 years and reminds us of the sacrifices that many good men have made over that time to promote our cause, being imprisoned or physically attacked for their beliefs. The NSM is a political movement as well as being involved in street activism, so they are involved in a lot of community outreach work. Jeff talks about how their roots go back to George Lincoln Rockwell and the only groups that have legitimate ties to his movement are the New Order and the NSM. He was taught by the people who had learned from him and public service was always a part of what they were doing. 
Jason asks what it was like to be a political skinhead involved in National Socialism and what changes he has seen in his time. Years ago a fight just used to be a fight, but nowadays you can be hit with hate crime charges as well, which can lead to lengthy prison sentences and ruined lives, just for a fistfight that may not have even involved racial politics. You cannot even defend your life any more without being charged with hate crime, as we have seen recently in Britain, where activists have received serious jail time for defending themselves against violent antifa in Kent. Jeff is banned from Britain as well as Matt, not due to any criminal activity but just because his speech is politically incorrect. Matt reminds us that the reason for this is because they have no answer to our talking points. They cannot debate us so they always seek to shut us down. 
The NSM will be taking an important role in the new Nationalist Front alliance with the TWP and Jeff talks about previous attempts to do this before, where good people have tried to broker a peace between the various organisations but due to petty reasons were never able to achieve it. He explains how the main problem has always been personality issues, where people have an issue with someone and then make up stories about them to cause problems. 
The TWP and the NSM will be at a national rally together at the state capital of Pennsylvania on November 5th and all are welcome, especially other organisations. Jeff reminds us that although it is good to be promoting stuff on the internet, real political change has always been made on the streets. He suggests that if people are worried of being caught on camera, they should just wear a hat and sunglasses. Matt points out that he has never met anyone at an event that he has ever then gone on to have problems with on the internet. 
For the last part of the podcast Jeff talks about how he has worked to modernise the NSM, distancing them from German symbols and concentrating on American ones instead. He has taken some flak for this but believes that if we want to win, then we will have to start taking risks, after all, who dares wins.

Proof God is on Duterte's Side! 
Azzmador October 29, 2016 God gave this man three missions: Kill drug dealers '“ stop cussing '“ gas kikes! 
These days it's not very often a nation can say their leader has the approval of the Almighty God himself, but now, the Philippines can claim this distinction. 
The Washington Post : 
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has made a solemn promise: no more swearing. 
Duterte, who famously cursed the pope and used a slang term that translates as Ã¢'Âœ son of a whore ' while denouncing President Obama, said he was flying back from Japan late Thursday, looking at a vast expanse of sky, listening to his colleagues snore, when he heard a voice say, Ã¢'ÂœIf you donÃ¢'Â™t stop epithets, I will bring this plane down now.Ã¢'Â 
I know many of you may be skeptical of his claim, but not me. I've heard people claim they spoke to God many times in my life, and until now, there was always some personal agenda involved. When I was a kid, I had relatives tell me God wanted me to have a crew cut. Then there were the more famous situations like Oral Roberts saying that if his flock didn't send him ten million dollars by a specified date, God would kill him, personally. 
Then you had guys like Ted Haggard. I'm pretty sure God told him it wasn't a good idea to be snorting meth off the units of male prostitutes while he was the pastor of an evangelical megachurch and spiritual advisor to the likes of George W. Bush, but if so, God's words went unheeded. 
Not so with the infamous Flip shitlord. 
Ã¢'ÂœAnd I said, Ã¢'Â˜Who is this?Ã¢'Â™ So, of course, Ã¢'Â˜itÃ¢'Â™s God,Ã¢'Â™Ã¢'Â he told Filipino journalists late Thursday. 
Ã¢'ÂœSo, I promise God,Ã¢'Â he continued, Ã¢'ÂœNot [to] express slang, cuss words and everything. So you guys hear me right always because [a] promise to God is a promise to the Filipino people.Ã¢'Â God's servant on Earth, Rodrigo Duterte, contemplating the sound of one hand killing all the drug lords. 
Now there's a man with his priorities straight. He identifies the speaker, and makes his promise, publicly, to God and his people, that he will obey. Of course, all fascists believe in a natural hierarchy, so his obedience just makes sense. 
An important thing to note is, when God speaks, what he doesn't say is just as important as what he said. He told Duterte, 'stop cussing.' Nothing more. 
Thank goodness he did not say 'stop killing criminals.' I was pretty sure he wouldn't, but you never know. What a relief'¦ 
Of course, not everyone is theologically adept, i.e. the author of the WaPo article. She took to Twitter to make some heretical and thoroughly unfair remarks. Err, to quote @astroehlein , "Did God mention the death squads?" https://t.co/QezjfCweEH 
'” Emily Rauhala (@emilyrauhala) October 28, 2016 
No Emily, God did not mention the death squads, and any true believer knows this means he approves of them. 
Where in the Holy Bible does it say you're supposed to allow savage drug kingpins to wage war in your streets, killing innocents by the thousands, just so they can decide who gets to sell poison to your people and in what location? I've never read that part. 
I cannot confirm whether or not Emily Rauhala is a Jew, but she's WaPo's 'China Correspondent,' and her Twitter timeline reads like someone with a personal vendetta against the fantastic leader of The Philippines. 
Whatever her problem is, she'd better get a handle on it, because in ten days we're electing a Great Christian here as well!

These Jews have such a hateful god, wow. 
Yahweh just punishing bitches left and right. 
RT : 
Two earthquakes, which struck Italy this week, were Ã¢'ÂœretributionÃ¢'Â for the countryÃ¢'Â™s support of the UNESCO resolution disregarding the Jewish connection to Jerusalem, Israeli Deputy Minister for Regional Cooperation Ayoob Kara said. 
Ã¢'ÂœIÃ¢'Â™m sure that the earthquake happened because of the UNESCO decision,Ã¢'Â Kara, a member of the ruling Likud Party, wrote in a memo, Ynetnews Ã‚ website reported. 
Ironically, the Israeli politician was on a state visit to the Vatican when the quakes hit central Italy on Wednesday, killing one and injuring 10 people. 
Earlier the same day, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), passed a resolution criticizing Israel for its handling of the holy site in Jerusalem Ã¢'Â“ called Temple Mount by Jews, and Haram al-Sharif by Muslims. 
The document was adopted after heated debate over its wording, and particularly the Arabic names used in the document. Italy was among the nations voting in favor of the resolution. 
Israel blasted UNESCO and its Arab members for trying to undermine Jewish connections to the holy site. 
Kara arrived in the Vatican in a fruitless effort to avert the resolution, but still managed to have a small chat with the leader of the Catholic Church. 
According to Kara, Pope Francis Ã¢'Âœstrongly disagreedÃ¢'Â with the resolution. 
Ã¢'ÂœHe (the Pope) even said publicly that the holy land is connected to the Nation of Israel,Ã¢'Â the deputy minister stressed. 
Yeah, he's not a good Pope. 
Our model Pope is Urban II, who just wanted to exterminate all non-Whites in the Holy Land, Jew or Moslem. 
Do the Jews not know that people are paying attention to these types of statements now? 
If so, why do they keep making them? If you ever see a Jew covering his door frame with sheeps blood, it should definitely be a cause for concern. 
Even if this Jew believes Yahweh did the earthquake as revenge, why would he state it publicly? Italy is not a Jew country and presumably does not believe in the magic powers of the Jewish god. 
So what is the point of making this statement, which can only serve to make the Jews and their god appear hostile, violent, hateful and evil?

A homeless Black woman has taken to defending Donald Trump's star on Hollywood Boulevard. 
It's a lovely story. 
The Gateway Pundit : 
A homeless TRUMP SUPPORTER guarded Donald TrumpÃ¢'Â™s star on Hollywood Boulevard from violent Hillary supporters. 
The woman was holding a sign that reads, Ã¢'Âœ20 Million Illegals and Americans Sleep on the Streets in Tents. Vote Trump.Ã¢'Â 
On Wednesday a violent leftist smashed Donald TrumpÃ¢'Â™s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
The culprits used a sledgehammer to destroy DonaldÃ¢'Â™s star. 
So later in the day this homeless person sat near the star to protect it. 
'Ima defend massa Trump's star. Dat massa Trump, he a good man, Gawd bless em and Ima here defend he's star.' 
You know, these Blacks did used to respect us. Love us, even. 
I've written a very important article about the love that Black slaves had for their slave masters, which you should read if you haven't already. 
This story makes me think of that. 
But evil Hillary spics are now harassing this sweet Negress. They attacked her and destroyed her sign. 
It's absolutely disgusting. 
It's like what they're doing to Danney Williams AKA D'Jamal Clinton. 
These people only care about the coloreds when they're their little pets. 
Note: I'm not 'going soft' on the Blacks. Hating Blacks collectively doesn't mean that you can't say something nice about an individual Black who is doing something nice. Read the slavery article. Yes, I still believe all Blacks '“ including this woman '“ should be deported to Africa. But I'm gonna personally make sure that when she gets to Africa, she is kangz n shit.

Newsbusters : 
In the twelve weeks since the party conventions concluded in late July, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has received significantly more broadcast network news coverage than his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, but nearly all of that coverage (91%) has been hostile, according to a new study by the Media Research Center (MRC). 
In addition, the networks spent far more airtime focusing on the personal controversies involving Trump (440 minutes) than about similar controversies involving Clinton (185 minutes). Donald TrumpÃ¢'Â™s treatment of women was given 102 minutes of evening news airtime, more than that allocated to discussing ClintonÃ¢'Â™s e-mail scandal (53 minutes) and the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play scandals (40 minutes) combined. 
For this study, the MRC analyzed all 588 evening news stories that either discussed or mentioned the presidential campaign on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from July 29 through October 20 (including weekends). The networks devoted 1,191 minutes to the presidential campaign during this period, or nearly 29 percent of all news coverage. 
I would say something about how if Trump loses, the Jews are going to be blamed. 
But now, there is not really any chance whatsoever that Trump is going to lose. 
Honestly fam, I'm a bit salty about no pogroms. 
Ah, but the Jew butthurt when Trump takes control is going to be just as beautiful as a pogrom.

Mexicans are Whining About Illegal Immigrants Stealing Their Jobs 
Zeiger October 29, 2016 Why can't I hold all these illegals? 
'When South America sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you, Jose. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. 
'It's time to erect a great wall on the southern border of Mexico and keep our borders secure. Let's make Mexico great again.' 
WFAA 8 : 
This sweltering Mexican village sits about 1,200 miles south of Texas, but the complaints about foreigners would sound familiar in the Lone Star State: People crossing the river illegally from the south are driving down wages, taking over neighborhoods and taxing social services. Others are gaming the countryÃ¢'Â™s legal immigration system by overstaying their visas. 
Tens of thousands of Central American migrants have passed through here fleeing their homelands, most trekking northward to seek asylum in the United States. But an increasing number are stopping and settling just north of the Suchiate River, the shallow body of water that separates Guatemala and Mexico. 
Whether they are biding their time or looking for permanent residency, the uninvited arrivals have tapped into a nativism that puts more pressure on an already tense and poverty-stricken region of Mexico. 
Ã¢'ÂœIn Arriaga, there are neighborhoods that are made up entirely of immigrants from El Salvador and Guatemala,Ã¢'Â said Jose Maria Morales Cruz, a retired teacher who was born and raised in the small town. Ã¢'ÂœAnd those who live here now donÃ¢'Â™t want to continue to the other side. Here, they are supported by their fellow countrymen.Ã¢'Â Is that so? 
Wow, that really sucks, huh, Pedro? 
You have my full sympathies there. 
You should really seal those borders quick, I reckon. 
Morales said he canÃ¢'Â™t blame the immigrants for wanting a better life, some fleeing gang wars that have made Honduras and El Salvador two of the most violent countries in the world. After all, thousands of Mexicans have migrated for years to the United States, he said, leaving poverty and violence behind. But he can see why some Mexicans arenÃ¢'Â™t high on the idea of immigrants originally headed for the United States staking a claim in Mexico. Just take a trip to an auto repair shop or other blue-collar business, he said, and youÃ¢'Â™ll see why. 
Ã¢'ÂœThe people that are from here [earn] 80 or 100 pesos a day,Ã¢'Â Morales said. Ã¢'Âœ[Then] a Guatemalan or El Salvadoran comes and they are offered 50 or 60 pesos. And they accept because at least they can eat, right?' Haha, silly rednecks. Stop with your paranoia about having illegals stealing your jobs. Get educated. 
Mexicans canÃ¢'Â™t do anything about the violence plaguing Central America, but if they want to understand why some Central Americans are settling in instead of moving on they can look to their own government, analysts argue. Another refrain familiar in Texas Ã¢'Â“ that the government has no control over the country's borders Ã¢'Â“ echoes here. 
It's hilarious that the Mexico is getting swamped by low-skill brown immigrants, while they're encouraging their own poor people to illegally enter the US to send money back into the country. 
What goes around, comes around, huh? 
I wonder if they have Jews in Mexico screaming that it would be racist to shut down the southern border? I'll bet they do. Everyone has these 'people' in their country making them do things. 
Maybe they can ask Trump to help them build their walls after the Glorious Leader rises to power. That is, after we're done building our own wall, of course.

Facebook Caught Selling Targeted Advertisement Which Excludes Different Races 
Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 29, 2016 "This is massively illegal," said one lawyer when shown Facebook's ad targeting system allows excluision by race. https://t.co/bCn8fLT529 pic.twitter.com/i62jKP5b8W 
This is so, so funny. 
The top SJW kike himself, Mark Zuckerberg, has been caught using logical means to sell advertisements. 
But logic, we goyim have been told, is pure hatred. 
No idea why they thought they could get away with this. 
RT : 
A scandal is brewing over the discovery that advertisers on Facebook can Ã¢'ÂœnarrowÃ¢'Â their audience by race and ethnicity, allowing them to remove their ads from the feeds of selected demographics, including African American, Asian and Hispanic. 
Micro-targeting, which assigns an ethnicity to users based on their page activity, is designed by Facebook to be used to target niche audiences, but it also allows for exclusion. Facebook claims advertisers are prohibited from abusing the tool, such as using it to discriminate. 
An ad purchased by ProPublica gave them the option to remove certain ethnic groups from viewing a housing ad. 
Ã¢'ÂœThis is horrifying. This is massively illegal. This is about as blatant a violation of the federal Fair Housing Act as one can find,Ã¢'Â civil rights lawyer John Relman told the publication. 
Facebook responded to ProPublicaÃ¢'Â™s report saying they believed, Ã¢'Âœmulticultural advertising should be a tool for empowerment,Ã¢'Â adding that they expect advertisers to use the service in compliance with the law. 
Ã¢'ÂœWhen World Cup 2014 became a big focus throughout the US Hispanic community, a business developed a campaign to reach people who had shown interest in that community in order to create a positive association between its brand and the worldÃ¢'Â™s most popular sport. This meant more relevant ads to those audiences about the World Cup,' the social media giant said, pointing out an example of micro-targeting being used successfully. 
Facebook also said that ads in different languages were another example of the feature being useful for its clients. 
It was a clever troll. 
I am in awe. 
I of course don't think this should be illegal '“ it is absolutely nonsensical to make it illegal to prefer certain races over another in any context. Even if you believe 'race doesn't exist,' the fact remains that the different races statistically act very differently from each other, so very much can be determined about a person by knowing their race. 
But it is so funny to see the SJW Jew Zuckerberg caught in his own Jew web of nonsensical gibberish.

Scientists Say Signals From Space are Probably Aliens 
Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 29, 2016 Some of these aliens live to serve and don't act like the Blacks at all. 
Aliens! 
New York Post : 
A team of astronomers believes that strange signals emanating from a cluster of stars are actually aliens trying to tell the universe they exist. 
The study, which appeared in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific , analyzed the odd beams of light from 234 stars  a fraction of the 2.5 million that were observed. 
The bizarre beaconsÃ‚ led the paperÃ¢'Â™s authors, Ermanno F. Borra and Eric Trottier from Laval University in Quebec, to conclude that itÃ¢'Â™s Ã¢'ÂœprobablyÃ¢'Â aliens. 
Ã¢'ÂœWe find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an [extraterrestrial intelligence] signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis,Ã¢'Â wrote Borra and Trottier. 
They also note that their findings align with the Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) hypothesis, since the mysterious activity only occurred in a tiny fraction of stars. The hypothesis also suggests that an intelligent life force would use a more sophisticated optical beacon than, say, radio waves to reveal its existence. 
Researchers sifted through data collected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey  an 8-foot-diameter telescope in Sunspot, New Mexico  to separate natural signals from ones that appeared generated. 
But there are more skeptics than not , including the authors themselves, who acknowledgeÃ‚ the hypothesis still needs work. For starters, the data need to be verified by at least two other telescopes and all natural causes need to be ruled out. 
Ã¢'ÂœAlthough unlikely,Ã¢'Â the study notes Ã¢'Âœthere is also a possibility that the signals are due to highly peculiar chemical compositions in a small fraction of galactic halo stars.Ã¢'Â 
The chief of NASA, Charles Bolden, has released a statement on the potential aliens, saying: 'If dey aliems wanga pop-off, we ready to pop-off. Dem muffugguhs ain't no shit. We her in da earf, we strait muffuggen rawl-oot. Da fug dem aliems fink dey is? Muffugguh all fugg u ass up, nigga, shit bitch. We killen erebuddy out here, we dont giv a fuq.' NASA head Charles Bolden responded to the potentiality of aliens with what appear to be violent threats. 
Barack Obama backed-up Bolden's statements, saying 'He be a stone-cone nigga, dat Bolden. Ah aint fux wif dat nigga. Ifn dem aliems gon fux wif dat nigga, it be like w . Nigga bitch out this muffuggeh, shii t.'

Go ahead. Count the survivors. 
The US Presidential election ended yesterday. 
Little information has come out since I reported on the situation 20 or so hours ago. 
Both sides have demanded James Comey release more information, and he hasn't even made a public statement. 
But the situation is clear. 
Hillary Clinton is now facing certain indictment. There is simply no way this investigation would have been reopened 11 days before the election if that were not the case. We must not let #CrookedHillary take her CRIMINAL SCHEME into the Oval Office. #DrainTheSwamp pic.twitter.com/GtPkj4xIz6 
'” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 28, 2016 
No one is going to vote for a Presidential candidate who may well be in prison a few weeks after she takes office. If they're continuing the investigation through November, she could well be locked-up before she has a chance to be sworn in. 
She is now nonviable. I half expect that they will pull her before Monday. Well, maybe not half-expect. Quarter-expect, perhaps. I don't even know if they're allowed to pull her at this point. I think they would have to put in Kaine. 
So far she's made only a three sentence comment on it, and her staff has said nothing but that the FBI needs to explain more. Basically, they appear to believe they still own the FBI. But if they did own the FBI right now, this wouldn't have happened. There's no way. 
The most logical analysis I have seen is that the agents of the FBI were revolting because of Comey's criminal collusion, and they exerted some form of pressure on him. I'm not sure what form of pressure they would have that would carry more weight than the pressure Hillary has. 
Basically, we've witnessed Kek intervention. 
A lot of people were saying Trump was going to win no matter what, and I kept that face up on the site. But tbh fam, I was a bit worried. They are going to have all these illegals voting, which will make a difference. They're going to do bussing. etc. 
Trump could contest it, but his only real leverage would be to threaten a putsch. And though I love this idea, I'm not 100% sure it would have actually happened. 
But now, none of that matters. 
Because not even the kike media can continue portraying Hillary as a viable candidate. 
We've won, brothers. 
All of our hard work this year has paid off. 
And make no mistake '“ every meme you posted, every comments section you trolled '“ all of that is what made this happen. 
Kek sent us Trump. Sent the crazy old bastard right down an elevator into our laps. 
And then he said 'DO IT FAGGOTS.' 
And we did it. 
We memed Jeb into a character of an obsessive cuckold weirdo. 
We memed Ted Cruz into Lyin Ted Cruzman Sachs. 
We memed Hillary into a freefall collapse of Hillary on 9/11. 
And now we've pulled-off the greatest meme of all time: 
They're going to lock her up. 
Take a bow, brothers. 
This is a small step for memes. But it is a giant leap for our agenda to secure a homeland for our people and a future for White children. 
I'm still a little bit in shock. 
This joy that I feel '“ I cannot describe it. 
There is actually a very decent chance that by November 9th, I will actually be tired of winning. 
In Conclusion 
Dear kikes: remember when I told you 'now is not the time for fear, that comes later?' 
Well. 
The night has never been darker and our enemies have never been closer. 
But lo, the people rejoice, and they sing songs of gladness. 
For The Don is rising. 
And soon, the swamp will be drained, and our enemies shall know justice. 
Hail Victory.

Hillary Screwed by a Jew Weiner 
Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 29, 2016 
So the story is that the Jew Weiner was actually having Skype jerk-off sessions with a jailbait on the same laptop his wife uses for work, and after the Daily Mail did a report on this (which contains some really raunchy quotes, including 'I would bust that tight pussy'), the FBI seized the computer. I'm not sure why the FBI is dealing with jailbait Skype camgirls, but I guess it's because they were in different states. 
On that computer we have the documents which the FBI is now claiming are of some import to the Clinton email scandal. No one knows what the documents are, or why they are relevant, and officials who have made statements on it have been pretty cagey. One said that it had something to do with collusion between the State Department and the FBI. 
The thing here is, I don't really see how there could be anything on the laptop that wasn't already reviewed by the FBI. Unless I guess it's some of those 33,000 that are missing (though I personally have a hard time believing they never recovered those). 
So the official story is that they found something on this laptop so damning that they had to immediately reopen the investigation. Something that couldn't wait 11 days. 
However, much more likely in my opinion is the 'FBI revolt' theory. That theory would be that the FBI agents were freaking out about the miscarriage of justice, and in some way forced the hand of Comey. Because it seems to me that the guy already totally buried so much criminality, that there is no way, whatever it was, that he wouldn't personally be willing to bury it. 
Overall, details are very scarce at this present hour. 
But something is going to come out in the next couple of days. You can be certain of that. If the agents themselves pressured Comey into doing this, then they believe in justice, meaning they are on the TRUMP TRAIN. So one of them is probably waiting to leak it to the media himself '“ just at the right time. 
But get this: if Hillary goes down, Obama is going down with her. I can guarantee it. 
If Hillary goes down, the entire system comes down. 
Donald Trump has blown the whole thing up. 
There is swamp juicy everywhere, and everyone is seeing just how sickening the whole thing is. 
The only thing left to do is drain it.

Can't stand Kelly's 'active listening' face. She has practiced keeping that big mandible shut - you can see her wanting to interrupt. Her neck strength must be immense. 
Studies show her jaw currently weighs 74.3 lbs. Holding it shut is a catch-22 as it grows through the act of holding itself shut (she cut her hair to decrease neck strain). Leading scientists/studies show, if she does not allow herself to become a mouth breather, that her mandible will triple in size by 3/10/2018.

Russia Did It: Cuck Moron Glenn Beck Claims The Alt-Right are Kremlin-Backed Terrorists 
Lee Rogers Daily Stormer October 29, 2016 Glenn Beck is a mentally disturbed individual who belongs in an insane asylum to ensure the safety of the general public. 
The first time I saw Glenn Beck on my television set back in the mid 2000s, I could immediately tell what a rotten phony this fool was. I honestly don't get how so many people got dragged into this idiot's nonsense . 
He recently endorsed Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump which says everything you need to know about his character. He willfully supports the most corrupt political figure in American history over a man who has a track record of building and creating great things around the world. Under what logical scenario does that make any sense? One would only do that if they are insane or have ulterior motives. Especially considering how he has sold himself as a so-called 'conservative' media personality for so many years. 
Now he is declaring a war on the Alt-Right . He has gone so far as to claim that the Alt-Right are Kremlin backed terrorists being armed by Vladimir Putin lol. 
He also suggests that people run away from anyone who uses the term 'cuckservative' largely because he knows that he is theÃ‚ very definition of that. 
This fool is insane. He should be put in a mental institution for the rest of his miserable life. There is no proof of anything that he is claiming.

While many are unaware of the coming demographic winter in the United States, the future of freedom in the country will be decided in the 2016 election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Immigration, voting patterns and demographics are the only true issues that matter in this upcoming election, as Hillary Clinton's amnesty to the 11-30+ million illegal immigrants in America will prevent small government ideas from being politically viable for centuries. 
Stefan Molyneux breaks down the raw data on the foreign-born population in the United States, immigration pattern changes since the 1965 Immigration Act, cultural differences in economic freedom and corruption, national IQ, attitudes on larger vs. smaller government, political party preferences, immigrant voting patterns, the truth about libertarianism, welfare consumption rates among different demographics and the shocking truth about crime and diversity.

Diversity Macht Frei October 29, 2016 
Conservatism is the defence of ancestral peoplehood. It is an affirmation of a people's uniqueness, their culture, traditions, values and trans-generational connectedness; in short, their ethnic identity. In America, however, thanks to infiltration and subversion of the movement by Jewish intellectuals, conservatism has been defined as its opposite. Instead of affirming ancestral peoplehood, this ersatz or kosher conservatism denies it; furthermore, it depicts genuine conservatism '“ the attempt to preserve a people's distinctiveness '“ as somehow shameful or morally tainted. This it accomplishes by expansively redefining the peoplehood to embrace outsiders. In place of a time-honoured community linked by genetic descent, the new criteria for 'tribal' belonging become shallow and abstract: place of birth; an administrative status; a bit of paper from the government; a list of 'values', usually ones such as 'openesss' or 'tolerance' that are simply disguised demands for ethnic self-dissolution. 
This redefinition of European, and only European, peoplehood into something abstract is a form of intellectual genocide, one largely effected by Jewish intellectuals who have mastered the art of manipulating Europeans by evoking shame responses. And insofar as this intellectual redefinition of our peoplehood prevails in the public conversation, which it does to the point of being almost unchallenged, it forms the basis for government policies that must necessarily bring about an actual genocide in which the ancestral ethnic community is dissolved through an influx of outsiders. Since, according to the rules of kosher conservatism, Europeans are not allowed to define themselves as an ancestral community, they cannot defend themselves as such. 
What we see in the Trump movement and the various populisms springing up around Europe is a response to this twin genocide, the intellectual and the actual, being perpetrated on Europeans by Jewish intellectuals whose ideas have achieved an ascendancy in our public conversation. These kosher conservatives are mortified by the sight of genuine conservatism, the element of ethnic self-defence that is manifest in the Trump movement. Here neo-con (((David Brooks))) of the New York Times laments the good old days when the goy knew their place. 
I feel very lucky to have entered the conservative movement when I did, back in the 1980s and 1990s. I was working at National Review, The Washington Times, The Wall Street JournalÃ¢'Â™s editorial page. The role models in front of us were people like Bill Buckley, Irving Kristol, James Q. Wilson, Russell Kirk and Midge Decter. 
'¦ The Buckley-era establishment self-confidently enforced intellectual and moral standards. It rebuffed the nativists like the John Birch Society, the apocalyptic polemicists who popped up with the New Right, and they exiled conspiracy-mongers and anti-Semites, like Joe Sobran, an engaging man who was rightly fired from National Review. 
Source 
Sobran was one of the old-school, proudly Christian, conservatives who attempted to resist the Jewish takeover of the American conservative movement, failed and paid the price for his failure. Here are some extracts from his New York Times obituary. 
Joseph Sobran, a hard-hitting conservative writer and moralist whose outspoken antipathy to Israel and what he saw as the undue influence of a Jewish lobby on American foreign policy led to his removal as a senior editor of National Review in 1993, died on Thursday in Fairfax, Va. He was 64 and lived in Burke, Va. 
Mr. Sobran (pronounced SO-brun), one of the conservative whiz kids whom William F. Buckley draft-picked for National Review straight out of college, made his mark with witty, thoughtful essays on moral and social questions. He was an unapologetic paleoconservative, opposed to military intervention abroad, big government at home and moral permissiveness everywhere. 
'¦ In the mid-1980s he ran into trouble with Mr. Buckley for the first time after writing several columns critical of American policy in the Middle East. Matters came to a head in 1993. Mr. Sobran, unhappy with National ReviewÃ¢'Â™s support for the 1991 Persian Gulf war, and with Mr. BuckleyÃ¢'Â™s criticism of his writing on Jews and the Middle East, attacked Mr. Buckley in his Ã¢'ÂœWashington WatchÃ¢'Â column in The Wanderer, a traditionalist Roman Catholic weekly. When informed by National ReviewÃ¢'Â™s editor in chief, John OÃ¢'Â™Sullivan, that the column amounted to a letter of resignation, Mr. Sobran was fired. 
Mr. Buckley, angry that Mr. Sobran had included conversations from a private dinner that the two had had, and stung by the depiction of him as kowtowing to ManhattanÃ¢'Â™s social elite, wrote in a letter to The Wanderer that the column Ã¢'Âœgives evidence of an incapacitation moral and perhaps medical, which news is both bad, and sad,Ã¢'Â adding that Mr. SobranÃ¢'Â™s criticisms were Ã¢'Âœa breath-catching libel.Ã¢'Â 
The two men later reconciled. Mr. SobranÃ¢'Â™s isolationist views on American foreign policy and Israel became increasingly extreme. He took a skeptical line on the Holocaust and said the Sept. 11 terror attacks were a result of American foreign policy in the Middle East, which he believed that a Jewish lobby directed. Not surprisingly, he spent much of his time defending himself against charges of anti-Semitism. 
Ã¢'ÂœNobody has ever accused me of the slightest personal indecency to a Jew,Ã¢'Â he said in a speech delivered at a 2002 conference of the Institute for Historical Review. Ã¢'ÂœMy chief offense, it appears, has been to insist that the state of Israel has been a costly and treacherous Ã¢'Â˜allyÃ¢'Â™ to the United States. As of last Sept. 11, I should think that is undeniable. But I have yet to receive a single apology for having been correct.Ã¢'Â 
Source 
Brooks laments the corrosion of the establishment media monolith that has allowed the dumb goy plebs to have a voice. 
The conservative intellectual landscape has changed in three important ways since then, paving the way for the ruination of the Republican Party. First, talk radio, cable TV and the internet have turned conservative opinion into a mass-market enterprise. Small magazines have been overwhelmed by Rush, OÃ¢'Â™Reilly and Breitbart. 
TodayÃ¢'Â™s dominant conservative voices try to appeal to people by the millions. You win attention in the mass media through perpetual hysteria and simple-minded polemics and by exploiting social resentment. In search of that mass right-wing audience that, say, Coulter enjoys, conservatism has done its best to make itself offensive to people who value education and disdain made-for-TV rage. 
ItÃ¢'Â™s ironic that an intellectual tendency that champions free markets was ruined by the forces of commercialism, but that is the essential truth. Conservatism went down-market in search of revenue. It got swallowed by its own anti-intellectual media-politico complex  from Beck to Palin to Trump. Hillary Clinton is therefore now winning among white college graduates by 52 to 36 percent. 
SourceÃ‚ 
That more highly educated Europeans now tend disproportionately to embrace their own destruction is the result of their heightened exposure to Jewish sophistry through academia and Establishment media. 
All over (see here and here for other examples), the Kosher conservatives are wringing their hands in anguish at the Trump movement, hoping it will go away soon. But the ethnic anguish the Trump movement channels is not going away any time soon, driven, as it is, by the harsh reality that Europeans are being turned into ethnic minorities in almost all of their ancestral living spaces. Even if Trump falls by the wayside, their anguish will continue to deepen and seek other forms of expression.

Nathan Glazer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan 
Beyond the Melting Pot, 2nd Edition 
Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1970. 
Beyond the Melting Pot: The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians and Irish of New York City was written in 1963 and revised in 1970, but its critique of American assimilation mythology is as relevant as ever. Co-authors (((Nathan Glazer))) and Daniel Patrick Moynihan note that the term Ã¢'Âœmelting potÃ¢'Â itself was popularized by the London-born Russian Jew (((Israel Zangwill))), who in his play of the same name wrote: 
Ã¢'ÂœAmerica is GodÃ¢'Â™s Crucible, the great Melting-Pot where all the races of Europe are melting and reformingÃ¢'Åš Germans and Frenchmen, Irishmen and Englishmen, Jews and Russians Ã¢'Â“ into the Crucible with you all! God is making the American.Ã¢'Â 
What should surprise literally no one familiar with Hebrew duplicity is that (((Zangwill))) himself was a zionist, that is to say he wanted a territorial nation-state for Jewish people established somewhere in the world (and preferably with few extant inhabitants, which is why he opposed the choice of Palestine). It would appear then that (((Zangwill))) did not really believe in his melting pot in a universal sense. And neither do the authors of Beyond the Melting Pot, who describe 1960s New York as a very identitarian place, one of both conflicting and allied power-blocs rooted in ethnic affinities. One may be left wondering if any Ã¢'ÂœAmericansÃ¢'Â even lived in New York apart from a trickle of WASP transplants, given how the co-authors slice what were the cityÃ¢'Â™s five largest ethnic groups. They literally have an entire section dedicated to naming the Jew, who at the time populated a fourth of the city. Is that America? Will it become America? 
And now to burst your bubble. (((Glazer))) and Moynihan were both liberals and sociologists, though contemporary liberals and sociologists would probably hate them. (((Glazer))) was a staunch anti-communist (and sometimes even labelled a neoconservative), while Moynihan was infamous for a report he put together while Assistant Secretary of Labor that criticized dindu family structure (high rates of bastardy) and was skeptical of providing welfare to single mothers (a toxic incentive). Critics accused the so-called Moynihan Report of Ã¢'Âœblaming the victim,Ã¢'Â a leftist retort that has since become increasingly common. While he was the 12th American ambassador to the United Nations, Moynihan gave a speech before the General Assembly denouncing a resolution which had declared zionism to be a form of Ã¢'Âœracism.Ã¢'Â Not very endearing for the current year. And while a senator in the 1980s, he predicted that ethnic nationalism and the slumping economy of the Soviet Union would become existential threats to communism in Eastern Europe, and criticized ReaganÃ¢'Â™s overhyped fears of its expansion. The co-authors of Beyond the Melting Pot were clearly liberals of an older stock than one is used to reading. 
And that more than anything else is what makes this book so fascinating. Beyond the Melting Pot tells us a lot of things we on the Alt-Right already know, but the writers are not on our side. It tells us about the alliance between elite WASPs, Jews, and blacks in politics. It tells us how Jews have been heavily involved in liberalism, socialism, labor movements, psychology, higher education, government and politics, and the civil rights movement relative to their size, and how almost all of American Jewry traces through New York. It tells us how Jews didnÃ¢'Â™t want religion added to the US Census because they didnÃ¢'Â™t want anti-semites to be able to track their numbers or influence. It tells us how liberals donÃ¢'Â™t view Ã¢'ÂœWhite AmericansÃ¢'Â as an identity group but are willing to concede that, say, Irish, Italian, or Polish people exist. It tells us how earlier Northern European migrants such as Scots, Welsh, Dutch, Germans, and Scandinavians had a much easier time assimilating into an (Anglo) American identity and losing their old ethnic consciousness. It tells us that blacks and Hispanics use the most welfare per capita and are less industrious than Whites and Jews, in addition to having very different family structures. It tells us that White Catholics have produced very little intelligentsia in New York and the United States despite their large share of the population (though your author is part of an aspiring post-Catholic intelligentsia). 
I am not deducing these or gleaning these points from the text. They are the text. This is what a sociology book on the ethnography of New York written by a pair of older school liberal academics has to say. 
Perhaps most surprising is the co-authorsÃ¢'Â™ stance that there are positive elements to the formation and existence of ethnic communities and neighborhoods, and that the government should not try to destroy such communities through aggressive integration programs. To some extent, this is just realism regarding the conditions of New York. It is purely descriptive, then and now, to say that ethnic neighborhoods exist where one group predominates. But even that is refreshing coming from authors of the left, for whom it is so often the case that race and ethnicity are social constructs and therefore neither real nor of value. It is further than that even, as (((Glazer))) and Moynihan do not merely recognize identity-based communities exist, but suggest they are beneficial in some ways and not necessarily products of Ã¢'Âœracism.Ã¢'Â Can you imagine the Department of Housing and Urban Development suggesting that Ã¢'Âœsegregated communitiesÃ¢'Â are not Ã¢'Âœracist,Ã¢'Â and that the government doesnÃ¢'Â™t need to break them up in the name of integration? What would Julian Castro do? 
(((Glazer))) and Moynihan do believe in the false idols of equality and integration, but they arenÃ¢'Â™t totally stupid about it. They know that building (implicitly Afro-Latino) public housing in a middle-class neighborhood always triggers White flight once the colored population hits critical mass, and results in ethnic succession rather than integration. They donÃ¢'Â™t have radical solutions for tackling the structural problems of ethnic diversity in a society. They tend towards gradual economic improvement as the solution, but as we all know, the United States by and large for most people is not a land of social mobility anymore, nor is it one where you can magically uplift radically different biocultural groups by pouring money into them. 
What you get from a book like Beyond the Melting Pot is a real Rorschach test of what you are already primed to find evidence for. If you already knew Americans voted in identitarian blocs, then you now know that it is nothing new. If you already knew some immigrants assimilate better than others into mainline American culture (or the regional culture of the area they move to), then you now know that it is nothing new. If youÃ¢'Â™ve already read Culture of Critique and knew about the involvement of overseas Israelis in leftist agitation and the institutional long march, then you now know that it is nothing new (and moreover that when Jews write about it, it is considered non-controversial). 
Ultimately, I would recommend Beyond the Melting Pot as a companion text. On its own, it is really just a general interest book with no application beyond 1960s New York City. In conjunction with other literature , it becomes much more illuminating.

The Neo-Liberal Globalist Wish List 
Hunter Wallace Occidental Dissent October 29, 2016 
I read all the #TruCon pundits. I even read the people like Damon Linker who write about the groupthink of #TruCon pundits : 
Ã¢'ÂœSome important segments of the party are quite happy with the way things were before Trump burst on the scene  with the GOPÃ¢'Â™s post-Reagan optimism, idealism, and conservative moralism; with the presumption that the country benefits when using military force to impose order around the globe; with the often unstated assumption that all Americans of every economic and cultural echelon automatically thrive when the nationÃ¢'Â™s entrepreneurial class is given everything on its wish list (massive tax cuts along with open borders and markets). Plenty of people are perfectly content with this governing vision, including most conservative pundits, much of the partyÃ¢'Â™s donor class, many senior officials and officeholders, most Mormons (including McMullin and his most passionate Utah supporters), many conservative Catholics, and some evangelical Protestants.Ã¢'Â 
I liked that image. I hope he doesnÃ¢'Â™t mind me borrowing it. 
Anyway, Damon Linker makes a good point here that gets to the heart of the issue: the Ã¢'Âœgoverning wingÃ¢'Â of the Republican Party is used to getting its way, and #NeverTrumpism is their revenge on their Ã¢'ÂœbaseÃ¢'Â (i.e., your votes belong to them) for defying its wishes and rejecting Bush, Rubio and Kasich in the primaries. 
Mario Loyola has a plan for reconciliation between #NeverTrump and Trump supporters: 
Ã¢'ÂœStill, the best outcome of this election, from the point of view of a traditional conservative Republican, is for Trump and the GOP to have a landslide victory and then for Trump to resign immediately in favor of Vice President Mike Pence, who is both eminently qualified to be president and a real conservative. Ã¢'Åš 
Pledge to impeach. Should God elect to ignore my prayer, and should President Trump prove to be as bad a president as his detractors fear, then it is my duty and the duty of my fellow Republican members of Congress to impeach him. And I will apply that same rule to any president of my own party who fails to uphold the honor of the presidency. GOP members face a painful dilemma in Trump, but thereÃ¢'Â™s another side to that coin. GOP members of Congress have a unique power that nobody else in the land possesses  namely, the ability to pull the curtain down on a Trump presidency by impeaching him.Ã¢'Â 
The plan is to elect Trump. He will be given the chance to sign off on our neo-liberal globalist agenda Ã¢'Åš or else, Paul Ryan and the #TruCons in the House will impeach him for Ã¢'Âœhigh crimesÃ¢'Â against the establishment. IsnÃ¢'Â™t it strange that Trump supporters donÃ¢'Â™t seem to care much about the #NeverTrump downballot? 
He continues: 
Ã¢'ÂœTo do that, conservatives will need Trump supporters. Indeed, they will need to prevail not just among Trump supporters, but among Democrats as well. The international consensus for low regulation, low taxation, and free trade, enshrined in the Bonn Declaration of 1985, later elaborated as the Ã¢'ÂœWashington Consensus,Ã¢'Â must be restored to its former state of acceptance among both parties. 
The neo-liberal globalist consensus (Team America World Police, globalization, open borders, low-taxes, Wall Street deregulation) among both parties (read: the uniparty) has to be restored to Ã¢'Âœits former state of acceptance.Ã¢'Â 
Kevin Williamson, who you might recall is famous for his declaration that White working class communities suffering from an opioid epidemic ought to die, is mounting a defense of the #TruCons in the GOP Congress : 
Ã¢'ÂœThe Republican party  stupid and corrupt as it often is  has in fact provided a number of dramatic victories for conservatives in recent years: the spread of right-to-work laws and school-choice programs, lower tax rates, trade liberalization, affirmations of the First and Second Amendments, restrictions on abortion, including a national ban on partial-birth abortion, etc. (See Charles C. W. Cooke, Ã¢'ÂœWhat Has Conservatism Ever Done for Us?Ã¢'Â) Consider the state-level work that has been done in Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida, Texas, and Oklahoma. These are not trivial victories  these are the small things that in the end add up to big things. Ã¢'Åš 
The Republican majority in Congress is like a hard and unpleasant job with long hours, but one that pays reasonably well: If you donÃ¢'Â™t like it, try doing without it for a while and see how that works out for you.Ã¢'Â 
You will be sorry when we are gone! 
WeÃ¢'Â™ve conserved a low top marginal income tax rate and globalization. WeÃ¢'Â™ve busted the unions, cut onerous regulations for hedge fund managers, kept the borders open to Third World immigration for half a century, and spread right-to-work laws. WeÃ¢'Â™ve given strong rhetorical support to ending abortion and let the assault weapons ban expire when George W. Bush was president. Why arenÃ¢'Â™t you rednecks satisfied? 
There was so much more for you we could have done with Rubio as president. We could have had Dow 38,000! We could have had World War III over the Donbass!
