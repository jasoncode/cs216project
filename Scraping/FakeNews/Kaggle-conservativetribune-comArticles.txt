Reporters Stunned to Learn Trump Fans Lining Up 12 Hours Before Rally Starts 
Reagan won so big that Carter even conceded the election before California was counted. The moral of the story, it ain't over til it's over '” and it's definitely not over yet. It wasn't in 1980 and it isn't today in 2016. 
The mainstream media wants Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to win, there's no doubt about it. WikiLeaks released emails from the account of John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, and one of those emails even discussed the use of 'oversampling' to rig the polls . Advertisement - story continues below 
Oversampling is a tactic where more of a certain group is polled '” such as more Democrats than Republicans '” in an effort to sway the results. 
This isn't anything new, but the concrete evidence of it out of the horse's mouth is huge. For the Clinton campaign to admit the use of this biased and dirty tactic in an email is something people should remember every time the media trots out a poll. 
As Ann Coulter noted in her book ' Slander ,' the liberal media has used rigged polls to sway public opinion for years. This election isn't the first time and, sadly, it won't be the last. 
The mainstream media is massively biased , and their polls are often rigged. Keep Reagan's 1980 landslide win in mind over the next two weeks '” and ignore the games being played by the media. Advertisement - story continues below

To liberals, racism is at the heart of almost every action we take. If they think they can take something as stupid as holding a sign and make it a rallying cry for social justice warriors, they will. Of note: The person holding the 'BLACKS FOR TRUMP' sign is white. pic.twitter.com/Bn3hJyiVZO

Because the internet is a truly wonderful place (sometimes), black Trump supporters started flooding Twitter with photos of themselves posing with Trump signs to counter the liberal narrative that no blacks support Trump. @TPuff44 @oliverdarcy there are black people next to her, I've seen males holding "nasty women" signs at HRC rallies..not a big deal

Despite what the media might want you to think, there are a fair number of blacks who support Trump . In fact, The Gateway Pundit reported that a series of polls indicated that Trump may receive more black votes than any GOP presidential candidate since Richard Nixon in 1960. 
If the liberal media actually did their job correctly, we wouldn't even be hearing about this non-issue. Instead, because they are so desperate to avoid talking about the WikiLeaks emails that are hurting Clinton's campaign, they will look for anything to distract the American people.

'That doesn't have anything to do with 'Lock her up,'' he said. 'You are ill-prepared for this interview, Miss Rubin.' 
'No, I'm not. I have a list here,' she said. 
A list from which she was utterly, laughably unable to produce the one thing she was asked for. 
'Miss Rubin,' said O'Reilly, 'I have just given you a minute where you hemmed and hawed. You said I justified a comment, 'Lock her up.' You can't point to it. And then you pivot to something else. You are ill-prepared for this. And this is the point I want to make. Your column and blog are a fraud '¦'

Obama Goes Off on Reporter Who Dares Ask Question That Didn't Get Pre-Approval 
That case had accused him of using unconstitutional methods to crack down on illegal immigrants in and around the Phoenix area, and he had been ordered to cease and desist from those activities by a federal judge. 
If convicted, Arpaio could serve up to six months in jail, though the conviction would not necessarily bar him from continuing to hold a political office. A trial date for the contempt charge has been scheduled for Dec. 6. 
Arpaio's lawyer, Mel McDonald, stated that the charge would be contested, saying, 'We believe that when the final chapter is written, he will be vindicated.' Advertisement - story continues below 
McDonald added that it was unlikely that Arpaio would actually be arrested and compelled to have mugshots taken, and said the sheriff intended to plead not guilty. 
This is not the first time that Arpaio has run afoul of the Obama administration, and should Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton be elected, it is a near certainty that her administration would place the sheriff near the top of their target list to be taken out one way or another as well. 
Arpaio's campaign released a statement on the matter, specifically noting the timing and political nature of the charge coming so close to the election. 
'The Obama Justice Department continues its efforts to influence the election for sheriff of Maricopa County. The department's actions in the last 30 days before the election are further attempts to sabotage Sheriff Arpaio in his bid for a seventh unprecedented term as Maricopa County Sheriff,' read the campaign's statement.

WATCH: Gingrich Accuses Megyn Kelly Of Being 'Fascinated With Sex' 
Sent by the Democrat candidate's top aide Huma Abedin five months before Podesta asked about Clinton's head, this email read as follows: 'She's going to stick to notes a little closer this am, still not perfect in her head.' 
As with Podesta's email, Abedin's may have been referring to a simple headache, or she could have meant that Clinton couldn't get the text of her message 'in her head.' Again, however, the evidence suggested otherwise. Advertisement - story continues below 
Critics have quite reasonably questioned Clinton's health during this election season because of her persistent coughing fits and haggard look. Moreover, she was observed nearly collapsing to the ground during a Sept. 11 memorial event in New York City. 
Specifically, a video recorded from the event showed her propped up on a barrier, trying to remain upright as her security phalanx prepared to help her into her van. 
As Clinton began walking toward the van, however, she began stumbling. Her campaign later first blamed this behavior on dehydration but subsequently attributed it to pneumonia . 
Combined, both the email revelations and the Democrat candidate's behavior have led many critics to speculate on her health, with some going so far as to claim that she suffers from Parkinson's disease or a similar ailment. Advertisement - story continues below

These numbers must have Democrat rival Hillary Clinton worried sicker than she already is. Advertisement - story continues below 
The mainstream media would love to have everyone believing that all black Americans hate Trump, but that's just not true . 
Trump has gained the support of many who understand that Democrats have never actually followed through on their promises. They have little to show for supporting liberals but more strife and tension from a black president who promised hope and change. 
Moreover, President Barack Obama has done more to increase racial tension in this country than anyone could have guessed. Many black voters understand that, and they do not see Clinton as someone they can trust to change it. 
Trump has suggested that Democrats have done nothing to help black communities and has pointed out that they often suffer the most from a breakdown of law and order. He has challenged all Americans to think outside the box and vote for someone different '” someone who might actually bring positive changes, such as jobs , to their neighborhoods.

UNREAL: Calif. Soldiers Billed for Thousands After Military Decides Not to Honor Decade-Old Enlistment Bonuses 
Why, West wondered, would any sane citizen risk his or her life to serve in a military system so corrupt and backward that it would make its veterans pay back their rightfully earned bonuses? 
What made this move by the Pentagon even more unsettling was how much money it had frivolously wasted on other things that the colonel believed did not deserve to be funded. 
'Here we have a Pentagon stating it will pay for sex change surgery for those who are suffering from gender dysphoria,' he wrote. 'I just want to know, how much money did the Department of Defense pay for those ' transgender handbooks ' and training materials?' Advertisement - story continues below 
He asked a similar question regarding all the taxpayer funds wasted on providing welfare to illegal immigrants , on operating sanctuary cities and on importing 'tens of thousands of Syrian refugees into the country, with benefits.' 
'Why not cut that off and provide the funding for these men and women who've served?' West wrote. 'This has been 10 years past and now we're punishing those who've gone on with their lives?' 
'They did nothing wrong, they didn't seek to defraud our nation '” heck, they put their lives on the line to backfill the manpower shortages made by politicians and government bureaucrats,' he continued. 'Is this truly how we honor those who have served?'

BREAKING: Trump Set to Break 50-Year-Old Record With Black Voters 
A breakdown of that poll showed Trump with an advantage over Clinton among independent voters, a shift from the 2012 election in which President Barack Obama won the state by garnering more support from independents than GOP challenger Mitt Romney. 
In Ohio, a poll by Axiom Strategies and the Remington Research Group showed Trump leading Clinton by a score of 46-42. Advertisement - story continues below 
Again, Trump won out over Clinton among independent voters by a margin of 4 points and was showing significant support among voters in cities such as Cincinnati, Dayton and Toledo. Trump and Clinton were essentially tied in the cities of Youngstown, Cleveland and Columbus. 
Another surprise from the Ohio poll was the breakdown of support for the candidates by gender, which seemed to show that Clinton's alleged massive lead among women has all but vanished, at least in the Buckeye State. 
Female respondents to the poll preferred Clinton to Trump by only 2 points, 45-43. Meanwhile, Trump continued to dominate among male voters, leading his opponent by 13 points, 51-38. 
Of course these numbers could still change over the course of the next two weeks, but far from showing the race to be essentially over already, they instead reveal that Trump has a pretty decent shot at winning two of the most important states when all the votes have been counted after Nov. 8.

The video of the house, posted on Facebook by Brian McKibbin, has gone viral, garnering over 2.5 million views in less than a week. Advertisement - story continues below 
The house was decorated with signs calling Clinton a 'traitor,''liar' and 'murderer.' The house also featured several large displays encouraging people to vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump. 
It was unclear whether the person behind the decorations decided to do this for Halloween or just because he really doesn't like Clinton . In any case, it really is an awesome display that works perfectly for both Halloween and the upcoming election. 
While this house might be scary, the real nightmare would be Clinton actually being elected. That's why you need to get out and vote. If your state has early voting, go vote right away.

'But the Trump tape just sent people over the edge,' she continued. 'I think (women) took particular offense, as I did, to the fact that Ivanka tries to make feminism a part of her brand but is standing by, as an official campaign surrogate, a guy who is an alleged serial sexual assaulter of women.

'I am not of the mindset that any vote not for Trump is a vote for Hillary, but a vote for Trump is a vote against Hillary. And I need to vote against Hillary. I need to vote against the media.' 
Hunter noted the extreme bias exhibited by the media who refused to fact-check Clinton at the last debate, and what he sees as the difference between what a Trump and a Clinton presidency would look like: 
'A Trump administration at least will include people I trust in positions that matter. I don't know if they will be able to hold him completely in check, but I know a Clinton administration will include people who have been her co-conspirators in corruption, and there won't even be a media to hold her accountable.   
Although Hunter didn't want to tell NeverTrumpers how they should vote, he asked them to think about how important it is to keep Clinton out of office: 
'I'm not saying you should support him, but you shouldn't lose sight of the importance of opposing her. If, or when, Hillary Clinton takes the oath of office, she needs to have as little support as possible. Frankly, she needs to be damaged. The mainstream media won't do it; they're in on it.' 
'A simple protest vote for a third party or a write-in of my favorite comic book character might feel good for a moment. It might even give me a sense of moral superiority that lasts until her first executive order damaging something I hold dear '” or her first Supreme Court nominee. But the sting that will follow will far outlive that temporary satisfaction. ' 
'I oppose much of what Donald Trump has said, but I oppose everything Hillary Clinton has done and wants to do. And what someone says, no matter how objectionable, is less important than what someone does, especially when it's so objectionable. A personal moral victory won't suffice when the stakes are so high. As such, I am compelled to vote against Hillary by voting for the only candidate with any chance whatsoever of beating her '” Donald Trump.'

That action left Rovin feeling particularly guilty. He told host Sean Hannity that he finally got to apologize to Lewinsky in person after a coincidence made them neighbors. 
Rovin also said that Hillary Clinton had an affair with longtime ally and lawyer Vince Foster that lasted for years. Foster was found dead in what police said was a suicide, but speculation has always been that he was murdered. 
Part of Rovin's 'fixer' responsibilities included helping scrub Foster's office after his death. He also said he was ordered to distract the media while Team Clinton rummaged through Foster's office.   
Foster also said he hired Jerry Parks, an Arkansas investigator, to spy on Bill because Hillary was worried about Bill's exploits with so many 'sluts' and how that could hurt their political careers. 
Two months after Foster was found dead, Parks was found shot nine times at a stoplight in his SUV in Little Rock, Arkansas. Rovin said Parks had to die because he knew everything. 
Rovin also said he was told to keep stories quiet in one of two ways: 'by trading access to the Clintons for 'positive' interviews or by paying the reporters.' 
Rovin also told Hannity that the 'endless attention' to the alleged indiscretions of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump was what forced him to go public now.

He even said he would supply caviar and champagne on the flight. He added that he only had one stipulation, and that was that Obama could never return to America. 
Hannity made his offer the day after White House press secretary Josh Earnest dodged a question about whether Obama would leave the country if Trump won the presidency.   
'He's working very hard to make sure that nobody has to leave the country as a result of an electoral outcome that the president doesn't support,' Earnest told reporters on Monday. 
What Earnest chooses not to realize is that there are some Democrats we'd love to see leave the country should GOP nominee Donald Trump be elected president. Not to mention there are literally thousands of conservatives who would be more than happy to pitch in on this one-way ticket to get Obama and a few others '” looking at you, Rosie O'Donnell '” out of this country forever. 
That would make a couple fewer destructive liberals for conservatives to have to deal with. Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is enough of a problem , and it would be nice to know that her predecessor couldn't do any more damage to our country, except maybe by telecommuting.

In response to a Bloomberg claim that the FBI had recovered some of Clinton's deleted emails, Clinton's team was supposed to cite that claim as 'proof' that Clinton never 'wiped' her server clean '” you know, like with a cloth or something . 
In truth, we know that Clinton's team 'wiped' the server clean with a program called 'Bleachbit' shortly after the contents of the server were subpoenaed by Congress.   
The talking points also perpetuated the lie that Clinton had turned over all of her 'work-related' emails to the State Department. 
Of course we learned later from the FBI investigation and Director James Comey that 'several thousand' work-related emails had been recovered from the private server, emails that had never been turned over to the State Department. 
In reference to the story in The Post, the talking points falsely claimed that Clinton had 'complied in full' with State Department requests to turn over all work-related emails.

According to the Epoch Times , a London-based company known as Smartmatic International has provided voting machines to 16 states this election season, and the chairman of this organization, Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, happens to be directly tied to Soros. 
'Malloch-Brown is on the board of the Open Society Foundations, run by Soros,' the international newspaper reported. 'His brief biography on the Smartmatic website says he was also formerly the vice chairman of Soros's Investment Funds and of Soros's Open Society Foundations.'   
The Times added that 'one of the easiest and most effective ways to alter the outcome of an election would be to gain access to a company that controls the voting machines,' as determined by a report published last month by the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology. 
The Daily Caller cautioned, however, that Soros has no 'controlling interest in' Smartmatic International '” and that the 16 states reportedly had no intention of using the company's machines this election season. 
Despite Soros neither owning the machines nor having a 'controlling interest,' it may nevertheless be a good idea just to get rid of the machines altogether. Why take any risks, given the massive importance of America's election process?

Trump Presents Plan To Expand U.S. Navy To 350 Ships 
Under the Obama administration, NASA has mostly focused on research and development. Space exploration has ground to a halt, thanks to ridiculous restrictions imposed on NASA by Washington politicians who don't know the first thing about space travel. 
Trump wants America to lead in space once again, and with that in mind he promised more investment in NASA as well as the expansion of current private-public partnerships to maximize America's potential. 
'I will free NASA from the restriction of serving primarily as a logistics agency for low-Earth orbit activity,' Trump stated. 'Instead, we will refocus its mission on space exploration.'   
Years ago, America led the world in space innovation. Astronauts like Neil Armstrong inspired generations of Americans to shoot for the stars . Science and technology programs flourished because America's children wanted to achieve the impossible. 
That dream has faded as our government has scaled back space programs over time. NASA used to regularly redefine the word 'wow,' but now all it does is maintain the status quo. 
What Trump is promising is a bright future for America. A revitalized space program would create thousand of jobs, spur advanced technological developments and inspire America's children to achieve the impossible once again. 
That's what America needs right now.

Trump Presents Plan To Expand U.S. Navy To 350 Ships 
They aren't being asked to return the money. 
Various construction officials who built hospitals way over budget received thousands of dollars in bonuses. Other high-level VA officials directly responsible for the suffering of America's veterans received tens of thousands of dollars worth of bonuses '” and Uncle Sam isn't asking for any of it back. 
If that doesn't make your blood boil, you aren't paying attention.   
This is government corruption at its absolute finest. While ordinary citizens who did their duty to this country are forced to drain their bank accounts because the government screwed up (again), executives and corrupt officials get to live large. 
Corruption like this is why Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is so popular. Washington is indeed a swamp , and he is the only one who can drain it. Someone like Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton, a 30-year insider, isn't going to fix what is broken. 
On Wednesday morning, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced that the Pentagon would be 'suspending' its program to collect the bonuses from the soldiers who had improperly received them, Fox News reported, although it was presumed that the program would be resumed once some kinks had been worked out. 
If we had a federal government that actually spent money correctly and held people accountable for mistakes, these former soldiers wouldn't be in precarious financial situations today.

BREAKING: Trump Jumps in FL, Takes 4 Point Lead in OH 
Take for example Florida and Nevada, which had been consistently labeled 'lean Democrat' by CNN but have now been shifted into the 'battleground' category, according to The Hill . 
The shift was most likely due to a slew of new polls showing the race in Florida to be essentially tied, with some surveys placing Republican nominee Donald Trump up a couple of points while others still showed Clinton with a slight lead. 
The same holds true for Nevada . CNN also listed as 'battleground' states places like Arizona, North Carolina, Ohio and Utah, even though Trump has shown a consistent lead in a few of those 'toss-up' states. Advertisement - story continues below 
CNN still predicted a Clinton win, though her possible margin of victory had contracted significantly from previous estimates. 
CNN suspected that Clinton already has the 270 electoral college votes necessary to win via the states they have labeled 'lean' or 'solid Democrat.' 
Conversely, it projected that Trump only had about 179 electoral votes in hand from similarly labeled Republican states, leaving about 87 electoral votes up for grabs. 
Of course, as always, the situation remains much more fluid than the media would like to let on, and things can change quite rapidly, particularly considering that Clinton appears to be sliding in many states while Trump is steadily gaining ground across the country.

Advertisement - story continues below 
He also blocked voter ID requirements in Texas, and was well known for testifying that political leadership did not play a factor in the decision to dismiss three of the four defendants in the criminal voter intimidation case of the New Black Panther Party, a radicalized faction considered by virtually every other advocacy organization to be a hate group. 
More than an isolated incident, this systemic disconnect from the concern Americans have for their children, their families and their communities is typical of the Clinton administration, and since Hillary Clinton has been literally at the center of U.S. power for 8 years, that term isn't a stretch. 
Despite four years of backpedaling on Benghazi and eight years of excuses for the loss of hope and confidence in America's strength and power to provide for our children and generations to come, Hillary Clinton has no answers beyond empty rhetoric. 
If Hillary Clinton won't stand up for our children, won't make them and their future her first priority, we must turn to a leader who will: her Republican rival Donald Trump. Advertisement - story continues below

Poll Released 36 Years Ago Today Had Reagan Down by 8'¦ He Won in a Landslide 
In an appearance on West Virginia's 'The Tom Roten Morning Show' (via Townhall ), the former presidential candidate said that he's known that the polls are rigged for years. 
'You know, I think sometimes polling is done to dampen election turnout so when Trump says the thing's rigged, I'm not sure exactly what he means and I'm not sure I always agree with him, but I do think that when we say over and over someone can't win that is a form of rigging in the sense that it is designed to suppress turnout,' Paul said during the Wednesday appearance. 
'In Kentucky, in our governor's race in 2015, the media said over and over and over again the Democrats were up 8 points,' Paul said. Advertisement - story continues below 
'The hope I think was to depress Republican turnout and these were coming from liberal newspapers in our state. And turns out the Republicans won by 8. They were off like by 16 '” 14, 16 points. And, but, I think some of that is intentional. The polls are put out, you know to make it either look closer than it is or to make it look like Democrats have a better chance. 
'And I think it's done by design to try to dampen turnout,' he added. 
All of this is a reminder '” don't pay too much attention to the polls. It isn't hopeless and it's not over.

Twitter Freaks Out When White People Spotted Holding 'Blacks for Trump' Signs 
The Bloomberg Politics Florida Poll surveyed nearly a thousand Florida residents who had either already voted or were committed to vote. The poll's margin of error was 3 percentage points, according to the New York Post . 
Clinton may like to boast of her lead here and in other key states, but the Florida results made it clear that Americans were still in control of choosing the candidate who becomes our next commander in chief. 
In fact, 64 percent of Florida voters were quoted as saying that America was 'on the wrong track''” and those voters seemed less likely to vote for Clinton, who represents the status quo of establishment politics. Advertisement - story continues below 
American voting priorities are clear: 21 percent of Floridians said the biggest crisis facing the U.S. was the terrorist threat from the Islamic State group, while 17 percent believed it was unemployment and jobs, 15 percent health care and 13 percent a decline in real income for American workers. 
Clearly, Americans are waking up. They trust Donald Trump to lead us, to keep us safe, to protect the middle class, and to restore an economy that protects the American worker and provides a decent way of life for us all, and for generations to come.

Former president Bill Clinton's chief of staff, Tina Flournoy, sent an email with attached photo to Brian Fallon, Hillary Clinton's national press secretary.

In Florida, early polling results showed independents favoring Trump. In addition, slightly more Republicans than Democrats have turned in early ballots, so it is likely that he is leading in Florida so far. 
Trump led among independents in Iowa too. 
One state where that has not been the case, however, has been Colorado. However, potentially offsetting that is the fact that, so far, men have turned in almost as many early ballots as women. That has not been the case in other states, and since men tend to support Trump at a higher percentage than women, it's good news for the Trump camp.   
These numbers indicate how important independent voters are in this election, and they prove Trump has more of an opportunity of winning the election than most liberals would have anyone believe.

Gorani interjected, 'That's CNN, you're calling us the Clinton News Network,' to which Hopkins immediately responded, 'That's exactly correct.' 
When Gorani pressed as to why Hopkins would say such a thing about the network, Hopkins explained that she was referring to the manipulated polls that CNN routinely passes off on viewers showing Clinton with a seemingly insurmountable lead over Trump.   
Hopkins proceeded to say that she and many others had 'grown bored' with the collection of 'meaningless' polls that were clearly biased in favor of Clinton and downplayed support for Trump. 
'I will say having sat in the Republican convention and having watched your coverage, it is completely biased. And I think Trump is doing a great job,' stated Hopkins. 
The two then attempted to speak over each other for a moment, with Gorani demanding proof that CNN was biased, until Hopkins finally broke through by decrying CNN's portrayal of woman as 'victims' who need to be shielded from someone like Trump, informing the host that women in general are plenty capable of deciding for themselves if they are threatened by Trump or not. 
She then proceeded to state that polls have shown how much Clinton is disliked by the general public, even saying, 'I find her abhorrent to look at. Her little smile there does nothing for me.'

Poll Released 36 Years Ago Today Had Reagan Down by 8'¦ He Won in a Landslide 
Most of the money spent on these expensive steak dinners was spent outside Alaska, in an effort to butter up her special-interest friends. 
'The cavalier attitude Lisa Murkowski has used in spending contributors' dollars reflects a Big Government mindset she has employed in spending taxpayers' hard-earned dollars in Washington, D.C,' Joe Miller said. 
She is a typical liberal fat cat who cares more about upholding a failing establishment than spending taxpayer dollars on the issues her constituents voted for her to address. She cares more about keeping her job so she can hang out with her special-interest friends than she does about actually doing her job.   
If Alaskans really want a responsible government that is going to work for the people and not for the establishment, it's time to let Murkowski go. 
It's not just good for Republicans, it's good for the country, because since Murkowski succeeded her father in the Senate in 2002, the national debt has increased by over $13 trillion. Now she spends nearly a quarter million on eating out. 
She is the most liberal Republican up for reelection and has voted with President Barack Obama over 72 percent of the time during the last Senate. With the possibility of Hillary Clinton taking office, do Americans really want Murkowski in that seat? 
'The 36-year Murkowski dynasty has led Alaska and helped lead the nation down a dead-end road,' Miller stated. 'If we want to change the course of our state and nation, we must change the people we send to Washington, D.C.'

It is unclear at this point whether the bodies were strapped to the hoods to serve as a warning to the rest of their fellow Islamic radicals, or merely as trophies to serve as encouragement to other Kurdish fighters.   
Regardless, it was a clear sign that the bloody battle to retake Mosul was underway in earnest, a battle that will most certainly result in incredible bloodshed and loss of life on all sides. 
It is possible that the Kurds deliberately chose to strap the dead bodies of their foes on the hood of their vehicles as something of a 'one-up' on the Islamic State group thugs, considering that those jihadists have used this tactic before with dead Kurdish fighters and captured Yazidi sex slaves who no longer served their purpose.

By the way, it's worth noting that Arthur Sulzberger's family has controlled the Times for 120 years, but Tanden reckons he's a 'schulzburger' as well as a wuss. Maybe Mr. Sulzberger should ask for more respect from political campaigns his paper endorses. Advertisement - story continues below

Moreover, Tanden's use of the term 'brown' was politically incorrect to the max '” so much so that former President George H.W. Bush was reportedly flayed by the media in 1988 after he described his Hispanic grandchildren as 'the little brown ones.'

However, when he asked them about criticism of Trump's African-American outreach, the mother and daughter blew him out of the water. 
'Well, I think Trump is reaching out to all citizens, including African-Americans,' Trina, the daughter, told MSNBC. 'He's trying to address a problem. It should not be a problem if you address there is something wrong, and you have a plan that wants to help people.' 
'That's what a president should do for us. He should reach out and try to help people and address problems that's going on in our country.'

' Repealing Obamacare and stopping Hillary's healthcare takeover is one of the single most important reasons that we must win on Nov. 8,' Trump told rally-goers Tuesday afternoon in Sanford, Florida. Advertisement - story continues below 
Other Republicans have been quick to jump on the issue as well, including vulnerable incumbent GOP senators like Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Roy Blunt of Missouri. 
Should these Republican senators and others maintain a focus on Obamacare during the final two weeks, they stand a good chance of fending off the Democrat effort to wrench control of the Senate away from the GOP. 
The same applies to Trump, should he refrain from media distractions and continue harping on the failures of Obama and his health care law, particularly in hard-hit swing states like Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, to name just a few. 
And he will have Obama to thank personally for paving the way to a Trump presidency through his horribly flawed Obamacare law. Advertisement - story continues below

Bob Woodward Says Hillary Clinton in Trouble, Foundation Corrupt 
'If they ever asked if you'd talked to me about it, you can say no,' Clinton said to Flowers when talking about her state job. 
Essentially, Clinton was telling Flowers to lie about the help he had given her to get a cushy government job because of her affair with him. This is the sort of political corruption Americans are sick and tired of having to put up with. 
Trump may have done some stupid things years ago, but he doesn't have a history of covering up scandals and playing insider politics to promote his career. Advertisement - story continues below

He went on to explain that Trump has done more for minorities over the last 30 years than many people, pointing out that he has opened facilities for them, hired them and promoted them . He added that Trump promoted the first woman to be the head of a construction company.

'I think the brand is hotter than it's ever been, but it doesn't matter to me. I don't care,' Trump stated in a taped interview that aired Thursday on ABC's 'Good Morning America.' 'It doesn't matter. I don't care about the brand. I care about the country.' 
His words were echoed by his son Eric, who also felt confident about the survivability of the family's brand in the face of relentless attacks. 
'I think we have the hottest brand in the world right now, and I think buildings like this are a testament to what we do every day,' Eric Trump said, referring to the hotel that had just opened ahead of schedule and under budget.   
There has been some damage attempted against the family business via negative press and spiteful boycotts, such as the mean-spirited campaign to ruin Ivanka Trump's clothing and accessories line by tying it to the leaked 2005 tape of Trump making vulgar comments about certain women. 
However, Donald Trump Jr. insisted that in spite of the negative press the brand was doing just fine and was even expanding, proving it was far more than just a real estate development group tied to the New York City and tri-state area. 
'The brand is much more than New York City. This is a global brand,' Trump Jr. said. 'I mean, when you look at the people he's touching on a daily basis, the presidency, fixing America is so much bigger than any of that regardless.' 
Granted, it is entirely possible that the Trump brand will suffer long-term from the unceasing onslaught of negative coverage, though it is also just as likely that the brand could even grow in popularity, depending upon how the 2016 election ultimately plays out.

A school in Austria had to be suddenly evacuated after it was accidentally discovered that a rock that had long been on display in a classroom was actually composed of radioactive material. 
According to the U.K. Metro , the radioactive rock in a Salzburg school was actually a chunk of uranium , the same metallic element used to fuel nuclear reactors and produce atomic bomb warheads. 
The discovery came when an anti-nuclear lecturer visited the school to deliver a presentation about the danger of nuclear materials, bringing with him an old-school radium-illuminated watch and a Geiger counter to show students how it measured radioactivity, such as the small amount emanating from the watch.   PHOTOS: Everyday Home Hides Most Incredible 1950s Bomb Shelter We've Ever Seen 
However, lecturer Thomas Neff soon realized that he was receiving abnormally high readings on the Geiger counter, so he began moving about the room in an effort to track down the anomaly. 
He eventually came upon a display of various rocks, minerals and fossils, in front of which his Geiger counter veritably 'exploded' off the charts, giving a reading of 102,000 counts per minute, about 100 times greater than the radioactivity of the watch, which itself was roughly 20 times greater than that which occurs normally. 
Neff quickly halted his lecture and alerted school authorities, who immediately began evacuating students and faculty while experts were brought in to assess the danger and rectify the situation.   
An alert was also sent out to other schools in the region, where subsequent searches of those locations turned up another 38 radioactive rocks in 11 different schools. 
The uranium rocks have now been gathered in a safe place, though there is no word whether any students or teachers became sick from their exposure to the potentially deadly material .

In all likelihood, the Democrats and media in the D.C. establishment are furious about Trump's new hotel because it serves as a nightmarish reminder of the utter failure of a job they have done in the nation's capital. 
In stark contrast to how things typically proceed in the corrupt swamp known as D.C., Trump's hotel was completed 'under budget and ahead of schedule,' something Trump is quick to remind Americans of. 
'We don't hear those words too often in government '” but you will,' he said, alluding to the change he intends to bring to D.C. should he win the election.   
Trump proceeded to run through a litany of failures by the government, most especially that of Obamacare , which he has been hitting hard in recent days. 
'The American people know what this election is about, and they see it every time they get their health care bills in the mailbox, or ride down a highway that's broken, or go to an airport that looks like it's in a third world country,' Trump stated.

'And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest,' Clinton said. 'He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman 'Miss Piggy.' Then he called her 'Miss Housekeeping,' because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.' 
Clinton wanted women to think she was standing up for this beauty queen '” and all other women '” by bringing this to voters' attention. The truth was that the former secretary of state had known about the issue since at least Dec. 2015 but said nothing about it until the timing suited her own interests. 
In fact, a 157-page opposition research file was emailed to Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta by her campaign's research director Tony Carrk.   
Along with information about Trump, the file contained research files on Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, two of Trump's main rivals in the GOP primaries. 
Podesta's emails were among those hacked by WikiLeaks, and more than 25,000 of them have been released so far by the group.

Australia Admits Gun Control Failure! Offers Amnesty to 'Offenders' 
Gallup has been asking Americans about their opinion on the assault weapons ban since 1996 '” two years after President Bill Clinton signed a federal assault weapons ban. That year, 57 percent of those polled said they favored the ban. 
But in 2006, the poll found for the first time that more Americans opposed the ban than favored it, and that opposition has typically increased over the past 10 years. 
What was most interesting about the results, however, was that the sharp uptick in those who opposed the ban came from Democrats, 50 percent of whom said they would not support a ban on assault weapons.   
Less surprisingly, 75 percent of those who identified as Republican said they opposed the ban. 
These numbers are detrimental to the progressive agenda of Obama and Clinton, who have made gun control , particularly a ban on assault weapons, a key issue. 
The truth is that most Americans know that our constitutional right to bear arms is imperative to our continued prosperity as a nation and that an infringement upon that right is dangerous.

However, after a county Democrat official who was also a gay activist received one complaint about Walsh, Walsh was summarily fired by the agency. 
Walsh responded by filing a lawsuit against the state, alleging discrimination, which in turn met with an official demand that he turn over all of his sermons , related notes and a host of other documents, a demand he is resisting and that his legal team called 'an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church.' 
A statement from Walsh read: 'No government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons. I cannot and will not give up my sermons unless I am forced to do so.' Advertisement - story continues below 
Walsh has been supported in his resistance by Dave Welch , one of the Houston pastors who was similarly targeted, who stated, 'I can't believe I'm saying this, but Georgia's demand is even worse than when the mayor of Houston demanded 17 different categories of materials, including sermons, from '¦ us.' 
'First, this is state government coming after a pastor, not just a rogue mayor in one city,' Welch explained. 'Also, the state is demanding much more material: sermons, sermon notes, all documents without even topical or time limits. It could even include margin notes in this pastor's preaching Bible. It's almost as if they are ransacking the pastor's study.' 
'This sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor, every church, every denomination and every citizen of faith in America,' he added. 
Walsh has also received support from the Concerned Women for America organization, with CEO Penny Nance saying, 'The words of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that '(i)njustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere' still reverberate today '“ especially as we witness the Gestapo-like tactics of his native state.'

BREAKING: Soros Election Tampering Explodes'¦ Illegally Funneling Cash 
I am very sorry when children have nightmares. I don't want children to have nightmares. Nobody on Conservative Tribune's staff wants children to have nightmares. I think I can safely stake that out as our editorial policy without consulting too many of my superiors. 
However, from that starting point on which Ms. Schmidt and I can surely agree, here are two reasons why I believe this story is prima facie bosh. 
Firstly, I question the genesis of this nightmare, and I find it unbelievable that the writer didn't. Did Schmidt not think that the child's bad dreams might have been the result not of the perfidy of Donald Trump but of the political leanings and discussions of her parents? If she did, does she not feel that maybe the tone of the piece was out of line? 
Secondly, let's assume that these parents have been completely unbiased in presenting the election to their children (which I find an unlikely possibility, but hey, it could happen). The world can be a nightmarish place '” and unfortunately, one of the things that makes it that way is an extremist movement connected, however tangentially you believe it to be, to their religion. 
If you want to talk about bad dreams, talk to survivors of the San Bernardino terrorist attack . Talk to survivors of the Boston bombing. Talk to survivors of 9/11 . These people have very real nightmares, sometimes each and every night, about very corporeal things done to them in the name of Islam '” and they're the ones who survived . 
These aren't idle thoughts. They are concrete events. 
For that matter, it's worth pointing out that the same terrorists probably wish to perpetrate the same nightmarish fate (or worse) on this 7-year-old and her family, simply for the crime of being Westernized. Is this what we wish to ignore in the name of making Donald Trump our national bogeyman? 
If Schmidt is so concerned about the nightmares that Trump's candidacy is giving 7-year-olds, perhaps she ought to go talk to grown men and women who still have those nightmares, thanks to radical Islamic terrorism. 
If the topic of radical Islamism and how to prevent it is so traumatizing to your children, it's time to turn off the TV instead of blaming those willing to address it.

In this case, I believe Streeter honestly wanted to make a point, not sing the national anthem, which is the matter of contention here. 
The national anthem is sung to honor the heroes who have served (and died) for our country before major events. It isn't time to make a point or 'have a discussion' (a discussion, may I add, that usually takes the form of a monologue from whatever social justice warrior is giving it '” who usually acts surprised and disappointed when people have a real discussion and push back against their disrespect of the flag).

'A year ago, I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee, and I am honoring that commitment,' he wrote at the time. 'And if you don't want to see a Hillary Clinton presidency, I encourage you to vote for him.'

'And would that program that you designed be something that elections officials , that might be on county boards of elections, could detect?' Arnebeck asked.   
'They'd never see it,' Curtis said. 'You would have to view it either in the source code, or you'd have to have a receipt, and then count the hard paper against the actual vote total. Other than that, you won't see it.'

Given the stakes in this election, and the poll rigging that we've already seen, what Curtis said should have a lot of resonance with American voters '” especially Trump voters. While the man that Curtis purportedly wrote it for was a Republican, establishment Democrats could clearly do something very similar if given the opportunity.

Trump Leads Independent Voters In Several Early Voting States 
Trump's gains appeared to come largely from a re-consolidation of the Republican base following the flurry of sexual harassment allegations against Trump after the leak of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, as well as from non-partisan independent voters , where he led Clinton 49-37 percent. 
The GOP nominee has also increased his lead over Clinton among white voters, interestingly enough even among white women, who now favor Trump by a margin of 48-43 percent, almost exactly opposite of their 49-43 point lean toward Clinton a mere week ago. 
The poll also queried respondents on the issue of voter fraud and the sanctity of the election, something that has become a hot topic following the release of the Project Veritas undercover videos and scattered reports of voting irregularities in early voting.   
Unsurprisingly, Clinton supporters were far more likely to downplay the issue of voter fraud than Trump supporters. Altogether, some 37 percent of voters suspected that fraud occurs 'somewhat' or 'very often,' while 59 percent believed fraudulent voting only takes place 'occasionally' or 'rarely.' 
Despite the closing of the gap between Trump and Clinton, some 60 percent of respondents thought Clinton will still win the race. 
As far as the internal ideological breakdown of the poll went, we once again find it to be weighted somewhat in favor of Clinton, as the sample of registered and likely voters included 37 percent who self-identified as Democrats, compared to only 28 percent Republican and 29 percent independent, giving Clinton a more or less built-in 9-point advantage among respondents. 
Expect these numbers to continue shifting over the remaining week and a half before Election Day, as the situation in the race remains quite fluid.

REPORT: Hillary's Friends Told To Lie About Her Email Scandal 
How powerful is the NSA? 
This secretive agency employs thousands of people and has literally weaponized our national information technology infrastructure. Most of the most powerful espionage tools are created by the National Security Agency's elite group of hackers. 
If there is anyone on the planet who best understands the NSA's clandestine capabilities, it's Kim Dotcom. The international encryption expert and open-source advocate wanted people to know that there was a clear path to recovering Clinton's emails that she has claimed were deleted because of their 'personal' nature.

Clinton began using the now-famous private server at her home in 2009. Using XKeyscore, the surveillance program revealed by Edward Snowden, NSA analysts could drill deeper into data as far back as 2012, when Clinton served as secretary of state, the Business Times reported. 
Congress spent millions of dollars investigating Hillary Clinton's missing emails and illegal use of a private server, and the liberal media , rather than reporting on the results of those investigations, has instead tried to use the conflict between Democrats and Republicans as a sideshow to distract from the issues that really matter to Americans.

Trump has suggested that he could put even more of his fortune into his campaign during the closing stretch. 
'I will be over $100 million, and it could be much more than that,' he told ABC News, adding the the total was already around $61 million. 
Both campaigns have been focused on the key state of Florida , a state Trump needs to win. Other key states that both nominees have invested in included Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina.   
Trump has pondered why he hasn't gotten more credit for hanging tough while the polls show him consistently behind Clinton. That's a good question, but the answer could be tied up in the fact that liberals have worked tirelessly to skew polls in favor of Clinton. 
Trump also appeared to have a healthy amount of self-confidence '” so much so that he invests his own money in him campaign '” something we haven't seen from Clinton. Ever. 
Most voters have become painfully aware of how Democrats lie and cheat about almost everything , and having Clinton in the White House would mean that absolutely no one could trust our commander in chief. 
That's a sobering thought that should make the choice of who to vote for crystal clear.

In an election race that had GOP nominee Donald Trump fighting to catch up, he needed a development of significant enough import to level the playing field, and he may have just gotten it. 
Although this election is far from over, Donald Trump was just given another real chance, particularly in battleground states where he has been struggling. 
Conversely, this also does not mean the the FBI is suddenly going to do an about face and recommend prosecution for Hillary Clinton. She has already escaped that once during this investigation when Comey essentially slapped her wrist and called it a day.

He believed the shelter, which was about 10 feet deep, could have been built during World War II after a German bomb landed close to where his home now sits. 
Marks said he bought the home from an elderly couple, who had built it in the 1970s. 
He added that the previous owner wasn't too concerned about the shelter, as he had just covered it up. 
'He clearly wasn't very worried about it and it just sat there until the hatch fell through. I think it's great and I want to clear it out and preserve it if it's structurally sound.' 
'It's incredible to think it has all been made by hand. It's part of our history, so it should be kept.' 
When he first started digging, the shelter was almost completely full of mud. After the area was cleaned out, Marks discovered glass bottles and old newspapers inside.

Early Voter Turnout Looks Great for Trump 
Trump Jr. was traveling between campaign events in Arizona on Thursday when the woman's car stalled in front of him. 
Instead of pitching a fit, blaming the woman for getting in his way or just going around the car '” like many celebrities in his position would have done '” Trump's eldest son jumped out of his car and helped the stranded motorist push her car to safety. 
Tyler Bowyer, chairman of the Maricopa County Republican Party, was impressed by the young businessman's reaction to the situation. Advertisement - story continues below 
'I've been around a lot of politicians. Most would just freak out or go around,' Bowyer told the Arizona Republic . 'But Don Jr. '¦ before you can blink, he's out there pushing the car.' 
Bowyer took a video of Trump Jr. and two other men pushing the woman's Chevy Impala out of the roadway and posted it to social media where it has been shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook and retweeted nearly 7,000 times on Twitter, as of Friday afternoon. 
'This just happened in Mesa and this is why I'm voting for (Donald) Trump,' Bowyer wrote on Facebook. 'We were on our way from a rally to another event and Donald Trump Jr. hopped out first to help push this ladies (sic) car off the road, get some water and call for help.'

It's difficult to say whether Dougherty apologized because he didn't do it and had made a stupid joke or if he was simply trying to avoid being prosecuted. 
Although we can't tell for sure right now what's true here, Dougherty's comments at the very least are a reminder of how important voter ID laws are. 
If everyone were required to present identification to vote, Dougherty wouldn't have made his 'joke' about how easy it was to commit voter fraud '” and if he actually tried to do what he boasted about on Facebook, voter ID laws would stop such a thing. 
For all we know, Dougherty may not even be a Clinton supporter; he could have been trying to make a point about voter fraud and the dirty tricks committed by Democrats. Doubtful, but who knows? 
No matter what his party affiliation or whether or not he actually did what he boasted about, he intentionally or not made the case for strong voter ID laws.

BREAKING: Trump Jumps in FL, Takes 4 Point Lead in OH 
Williams, who has publicly stated that he was not a Trump supporter, is nevertheless a man of honor and integrity. He doesn't sell his values to common thugs who use bylines as weapons. 
According to both Williams and his attorney, Jonathan Franks, Jacob Bernstein from The Times approached Williams, asking for cooperation on a story alleging that people who live in Trump-branded buildings want the Trump name removed in light of the very difficult and contentious 2016 election season. 
Williams, an independent who lives in a Trump-developed New York building, declined to cooperate.   
According to Franks, Bernstein replied to a specific request not to print Williams' address by stating he 'would be more likely to extend that courtesy if Montel gave an interview.' 
Protecting another person's privacy, especially the privacy of the ballot box, is not a special courtesy. It's simply common decency. 
The Washington Examiner took their colleagues at The Times to task for this low-life journalism, noting that Williams identifies as a conservative but is not a registered Republican. He endorsed Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the 2016 GOP primary and has publicly credited Kasich for bringing him back into the conservative fold.

The various revelations from WikiLeaks were also a topic of discussion, with Root bringing up a message he had seen from Democrat National Committee head Donna Brazile to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta about just how terrible the economy really was, despite all of the glowing reports and reassurances to the general public from the administration and liberal media. 
Trump was actually somewhat shocked by the news, having not seen that particularly incriminating email yet, and begged Root to send him a copy or link to it so he could familiarize himself with the details and use it on the campaign trail. 
The topic of voter fraud also came up in the conversation, though the ever-optimistic Root insisted that Trump's supporters would be capable of overcoming with a massive turnout whatever tricks might be in store. Root even jested that Trump would actually win the race by 10 points but be declared a winner by only two due to widespread fraud and irregularities.   
You can listen to the entire interview right here, with the interesting bit regarding Brazile's email to Podesta about the economy coming shortly after the eight-minute mark. 
While the discussion was quite encouraging for Trump, it was also rather enlightening, as Root revealed more of the duplicitous nature of the Clinton campaign that Trump had not yet been made aware of. 
Hopefully Trump will follow the advice given him by Root and others and keep a focus on Obamacare over the remainder of the race, as that issue hits home with virtually all voters and most certainly doesn't help Clinton at all.

There was just one problem. The Bundys were still expected to stand trial in Nevada for an earlier standoff that occurred several years prior. Moreover, U.S. Marshals present at the verdict hearing Tuesday reportedly had a retainer for Ammon. This led to an in-court altercation, and he was again placed in custody.
