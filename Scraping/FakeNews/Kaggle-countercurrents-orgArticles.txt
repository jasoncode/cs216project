Whew! Finally, the charade is over. Donald Trump is now the President of the United States of America. What does that mean? It means that Simpsons prediction came true: https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2146815/the-simpsons-correctly-predicted-a-donald-trump-presidency-16-years-ago-in-episode-set-in-the-near-future/ 
So now you know who to refer to for accurate predictions about the future. Goodbye Tarot cards, et al. In 1995 I recall reading a survey which concluded that America was not likely to be ready for a woman president for the next twenty years. Twenty-one years later, it looks like that prediction was true. Given that women in America to this day are paid 80% of what men are paid, it is not surprising that Americans find it tough to visualize a woman in the White House in any place other than the President's bed. 
So, what does Trump mean for America, for American Muslims, for Muslims worldwide, for non-whites in America and globally? I am asking this rhetorical question as I see all kinds of doomsday predictions flying around. I apologize for taking a different view. I see the Trump presidency as an opportunity for those who believe in the opposite of everything that Donald Trump promoted in his campaign to put their actions where their mouths are and show that they are as willing to stand up for what they believe in as he was. 
What does Trump mean for America? I hope he will be the best thing that happened to America ever. I hope that he can truly make 'America Great Again'. I say that because though I am not American (should I say, 'Thank God?'), I am one who believes that a truly 'Great America', can make this world great. The world truly needs to change. We need someone to lead the way to make the world compassionate, caring, fighting against injustice, corruption and poverty; disease and ignorance. Which nation is better suited to lead that fight? America has the resources, the intelligence, the education and the leadership ability which I hope it chooses to exercise. Trump won on the anti-establishment platform. I support that fully. The establishment has shown that what it can do is to fail spectacularly. The economy crashed and Obama rewarded those who crashed it. People were and are homeless when there are empty homes on foreclosed loans enough for every American to have two homes, not only one. Yet they are on the streets. I hope Trump can put Americans back in their own homes. 
Bush father and son, started never ending wars. Obama continued them adding his own flavor to it of drone strikes '“ using technology to create bug splats (the arrogance is incredible) '“ thereby escalating the global threat level that comes from driving people to desperation. Obama's dabbling (what else to call it?) in Middle Eastern politics resulted in continuing the misery for people of Afghanistan and Iraq and new misery for people of Syria and by inference for the rest of the world. And to top it all ISIS came into being because of all of the above. The credit can be shared by all of them. So, Trump standing against the establishment means that he is against all of this. I sincerely hope so. 
All the jingoism that he rode on will get tempered when it comes to facing reality. It is easy to talk about kicking out the Mexicans and so on. But the day he does that, reality will dawn on him and his cohorts like it did on those who voted Pro-Brexit; that the rich need the poor to survive while the poor don't need the rich. When nice white Americans get to pay $3 per potato, they will realize the value of cheap labor. Meanwhile some contractor will get the contract to build the Wall, which he will do from the Mexican side, no doubt as otherwise his margin will not make it worthwhile. So also, the wonderful idea to outlaw the H-1 visa. I don't think it will take very long for Trump and his gang to realize that there is a reason there are blond jokes. And that Indians are not blond. Go figure that. 
The good news is that Trump made public what was private '“ racism, misogyny in a country that never stops 'trumpeting' about women's equality, support for genocide, wars and weapons sales, the evils of unbridled capitalism, locker-room conversations which indicate attitudes '“ have all come out of the closet and locker-room. Now it is up to those who like to say that they believe in the opposite of all these things, to get off their backsides and bring about change. They can no longer live the lives of pretense and lies that they had become used to, saying, 'It is not happening here.' Trump proved that it is happening and has trumpeted it from the top of Trump tower. Sorry for so much bad punning in one breath. But there you go. 
As for Muslims and Trump, believe me Trump is far better than what Muslims have seen in the past. He is far better than what we have today. Take Sisi, the Oily royals who are personal friends of every weapons dealer, the Paki leadership and I can think of several more and Trump begins to look like a choir boy. What will he do that is not already happening? Frankly I don't know and don't care to speculate because the prime movers behind Muslim affairs and how they are, are Muslims themselves. Our leadership or more correctly its spectacular failure. Ordinary citizens pay the price, but what's new about that? The fact remains that until we sort that out and do something about taking charge of our destiny, we must remain satisfied with others writing the script we are compelled to live by. Play endings depend on the script, not on the players. 
India is a classic example where a so-called minority of 200 million is kicked around like a football and used at will by every mercenary politician for his own ends. But Indian Muslims seem to be satisfied with that, so who is anyone else to complain. If you disagree and tell me that they are not satisfied, then I must ask you what it is that prevents them from doing what is glaringly obvious; get their act together, change their leaders and write their own script. 200 million is not a minority. It is a nation. But only if it chooses to be. Same story for Muslims globally. No point in blaming Trump or looking up to him to find solutions. It is our problem and we must solve it, so let us start doing that. 
Two other points: what about wars, global warming and such issues? Well, when you have a nation that lives on perpetual warfare and is supported in that by all the other major industrial nations who either manufacture and sell weapons or buy them, how can you pin it all on Trump? If weapons are made and sold, there will be wars. Wars will happen if they continue to make profits for those who run them. That people die is incidental. Those at the top who laugh all the way to the bank, don't. Those that do, don't count. They are 'collateral', who are necessary to prove the efficacy of the weapons that were used to vaporize them. If it wasn't for the bugs who splatted, how would you assess the drones or their operators? The fact that the bugs were innocent or that they had families and so on; well, bugs are bugs. And that's all that there is to it. 
Global warming? America decided on that when it chose Bush instead of Al Gore. For a minute I thought that was because they got confused because his name is Al Gore like Al Ghurair. But then I realized that it was because he had a terminal problem; he had a brain. See his famous movie, An Inconvenient Truth, and you will see what I mean. https://www.algore.com/library/an-inconvenient-truth-dvd If you do nothing else, buy this and see it. At least you will know why you died. Since you chose that, especially Americans, I believe it is only fair that you understand what you did. With Trump, that came out in the open, so get used to summer all year long. You won't need to go to the French Riviera for a tan. You can get it at home. That is not inconvenient. 
Add to this the effect ofunending wars, refugee movement, changing cultures, security nightmares coming true, widening gap between the rich and the poor, global poverty and hunger, preventable disease which is not prevented because there's no profit in it '“ when I think about all this and Trump's election, Nero comes to mind. Renewing our link with tradition. Let us dance to the tune. What's the use of fiddling otherwise? 
Final question that everyone is asking, 'How safe is it to have someone like Trump with his finger on the nuclear button?' 
My answer is, 'The one who actually pressed that button was as different from Trump as could be. Yet he did it.' Let me leave you to figure out the rest. 
Meanwhile it is midnight where I live, far away from Trump and America and time to go to bed. Truly it is said that there is solace in sleep. So, good night, world. Sleep well. As long as you stay asleep you can escape responsibility.

in Climate Change '” by Nadia Prupis '” November 15, 2016 The researchers say 82 percent of 'core ecological processes' on land and sea have been affected by climate change in a way that has not been expected 'for decades.' (Photo: Lwp KommunikÃ¡ciÃ³/flickr/cc) 
Climate change is already affecting life on Earth, despite a global temperature increase of just 1Â°C, according to a new study published in the journal Science on Friday. 
Nearly every ecosystem on the planet is being altered, and plants and animals are being so affected that scientists may soon be forced to intervene to create 'human-assisted evolution,' the study, titled The Broad Footprint of Climate Change from Genes to Biomes to People , found. 
The researchers say 82 percent of 'core ecological processes' on land and sea have been affected by climate change in a way that had not been expected 'for decades.' 
Co-author and professor John Pandolfi of the University of Queensland said , 'Temperature extremes are causing evolutionary adaption in many species, changing them genetically and physically. These responses include changes in tolerances to high temperatures, shifts in sex-ratios, reduced body size, and migration of species.' 
'Understanding the extent to which these goods and services have been impacted allows humans to plan and adapt to changing ecosystem conditions,' he said. 
Dr. James Watson, associate professor of planning and environmental management at UQ's School of Geography, added, 'We are simply astonished at the level of change we observed which many of us in the scientific community did not expect to see for decades.' 
The changes have manifested in some species shifting to higher or lower ground as the planet heats up, while others are becoming smaller, 'as a higher surface-area-to-body-mass ratio makes it easier to stay cool,' the Independent reported . The outlet wrote: 
For example, six species of woodland salamander in the Appalachian Mountains have undergone an average eight per cent reduction in body size over the past 50 years. 
Slightly smaller lizards might not sound like something to overly concern humans, but there is evidence this response is also affecting important sources of food. 
'These multi-level biological impacts of climate change will affect humans. Increasing disease outbreaks, inconsistent crop yields, and reduced fisheries productivity all threaten our food security,' said co-author Dr. Tom Bridge. 
Average global temperatures have risen 1Â°C since the industrial era. The study states that this has 'already had broad and worrying impacts on natural systems, with accumulating consequences for people. Minimizing the impacts of climate change on core ecological processes must now be a key policy priority for all nations.' 
The study called on governments to follow through on the promises made in the Paris climate agreement , which aims to keep global warming below a 1.5Â°C threshold'”although an increasing amount of scientists are sounding the alarm that even those pledges may be too little, too late. 
'Time is running out for a globally synchronized response to climate change that integrates adequate protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services,' the study continued. 
'It is no longer sensible to consider this as a concern for the future'”if we don't act quickly to curb emissions it is likely that every ecosystem across Earth will fundamentally change in our lifetimes,' said Dr. Watson.

NAPM condemns state and 'expert' apathy on deaths of hundreds of adivasi children in Malkangiri: Demands immediate medical relief and justice 
Apex Court must intervene urgently: State must declare medical emergency 
23rd Nov, 2016: The National Alliance of People's Movements is extremely pained and concerned about the rising number of deaths of adivasi children in the tribal district of Malkangiri, Orissa due to outbreak of Japanese Encephalitis (JE). While the deaths have crossed the unpardonable mark of 300, the Govt. as usual, continues to undercut the number to less than the half of the actual deaths. Even taking the official figure of 121 deaths, it an extremely serious case and calls for an urgent, comprehensive action, in a situation when state apathy and delay have been primary reasons for these avoidable deaths on such a large scale. 
We are indeed shocked that the 'Team of Experts' sent by the Centre has tried to absolve the Government of all responsibility by attributing the deaths to consumption of some local seeds (Bana Chakundi) and not to JE and governmental delay, thereby blaming the adivasis themselves for the deaths! When as per the Orissa Govt's statistics, itself 32 cases are 'confirmed JE', there out to have been remedial medical response on a war-footing considering the seriousness of JE, which can be fatal or can lead to life-long intellectual, behavioral or neurological impairments in many cases. It is also a serious question as to why the Govt. did not ensure timely incorporation of JE immunization in the public health delivery, as per WHO standards and remained in denial mode. The extremely casual response of the medical department, State Govt. and now even the Centre through this 'Expert Team' only demonstrates that even in this time of crisis, the concern is more their 'onus' and 'image' than the life of the children. 
Public Health Expert Dr. Sylvia Karpagam in her reasoned counter to the Centre's report questions that when the so-called toxic seeds are consumed all round the year and by all families in the tribal region, since generations, it is intriguing as to why this epidemic erupts here only on children and why now. One likely reason might be that the presence of JE, in the already malnourished children, could have been aggravated by the consumption of the seeds, in some cases. But for the Central Team to take a generalized and extrapolated position on the basis of only 5 urine samples (out of 121 official, admitted death) is certainly not a scientific way of medical research or does it appear convincing in the present circumstances. Many other experts as well have questioned the Central team's unilateral conclusions, merely on the basis of toxicity in the urine samples, especially since JE cases and deaths have been reported across the district even in the Malkangiri town. 
It is also pertinent to note that the Expert team has remained completely silent on the crucial role (or failure) of the anganwadis and ICDS monitoring system in the state in providing nutritional and health support to children in the tribal areas. This is despite the fact that the Apex Court has, time and again attached highest priority to ensure health and nutrition in all the tribal tracts and hamlets across the country, in the form of hot cooked meals. This situation is clearly in violation of the orders of the Supreme Court in the Right to Food Case (Civil Writ Petition No. 196/2001). In fact, one has to only go through the fact finding reports by Right to Food Campaign in Malkangiri districts conducted in 2012 as well as 2016. The abysmal situation of Public Health Infrastructure and Food Distribution systems are one of the main reasons behind the regular outbreak of JE disease. The rampant malnutrition, under staffed public health institutions, abysmal health infrastructure are providing the perfect breeding ground for outbreak and spread of the disease. It is indeed ironical that while on the one hand the Union Ministry of Women and Child Welfare is pushing for packaged foods and gearing up to sign Corporate MoUs, in violation of SC's norms, on the other the anganwadis and ICDS servises in many areas of Malkangiri or elsewhere, especially in tribal areas seem to be utter disarray. 
In the light of this serious situation, NAPM: CALLS UPON the Centre and State to declare this as a medical emergency and ensure anti JE-immunization and other medical relief on a war-footing. DEMANDS an independent enquiry into this crisis by a multi-member team comprising of renowned public health professions, independent health activists and doctors. 
CALLS UPON the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) to immediately take cognizance of the situation and their team, including Commission members and medical experts to investigate the causes, recommend immediate measures and speed up action on the ground. 
CALLS UPON the Governor of Orissa to make an immediate visit to the affected areas as the constitutional custodian of peace and good government for the tribal areas and ensure relief and justice to the adivasi children and families. 
APPEALS to the Hon'ble Supreme Court to immediate take up this matter in the ongoing Right to Food case (Civil WP 196/2001) and issue directions to the State and Centre and also monitor the proceedings before the Orissa High Court in the ongoing PIL against the JE. 
APPEALS to all progressive activists, students, the national media and pro-people medical experts to reach Malkangiri to assist the adivasis in whatever way possible, establish the scientific and true reasons of the scale of deaths, intervene to ensure immediate medical assistance and press for accountability of the state agencies and other actors involved.
