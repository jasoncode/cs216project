Muckraking Marines Cards and Cannabis with Sheree Geo >> EPISODE #30 AIRED: 11-10-2016 
2 Marines walk into a bar. They go into the ladies room, no one blinks an eye. Happy 241st Marines! Your two favorite lady leathernecks, Luckee and Star, celebrate the Marine Corps Birthday. We discuss the real news of today and exhort everyone to stay on top of the elites, make sure that just because the election is over, our job is not. Some pretty dark and ugly things that the power brokers of D.C. have come to light and we have proof of it. We will continue reporting on that as evidence comes in. Sen. Nancy Shaefer exposed abuse and was later murdered. Cynthia McKinney grill Rumsfeld on awarding huge contracts to those who engage in child sex slave rings, and she didn't get reelected. Those who expose this are tamped down, and those who engage in it are rewarded. It is high time we do more than just vote. We must act. It stops now. We also talked about Cannabis and how it has passed in states. In the 2nd hour Sheree Geo weighs in on the events of today. Sheree gave us an overview on the what the cards and charts read for the state of our country. She gives us a message of what is going on and what we all as individuals need to do to ensure a better outcome. We talked of the election of Trump and what that means in geopolitics. We also talked about what that means for U.S. Israeli relations and what THAT means for those in Gaza and the Middle East.
