Kurds Worried Turkey Will Stab Them in the Back as They Fight ISIS Turkey publicly opposes ISIS while supporting them behind the scenes Image Credits: Kurdish YPG fighters: Kurdishstruggle . 
Two months after being purged from the border town of Jarablus in northern Syria by a Turkish-led force — and just days after being targeted by Turkish airstrikes near al-Bab — Syrian Kurds now fear a 'stab in the back' from Turkey's military as plans for a U.S.-led push to clear ISIS fighters from Raqqa are carried out. 
'It is very important Raqqa is liberated,' a chief political leader of the main Syrian Kurdish party, the PYD, told Reuters . 'But one point which is bothering us is that, if we go toward Raqqa, we will be stabbed from the back.' 
At the end of August, Turkish forces took part in a U.S.-led operation to eject ISIS from the northern border of Syria. Once inside Syria, however, Turkish forces — leading Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels — took aim at Kurdish fighters in the town of Jarablus, which sent them scurrying across the Euphrates River in retreat. 
The issue here is that the U.S. claims to find the Kurds useful in the fight against ISIS. The Kurds, in fact, make up a significant portion of one of the primary U.S.-supplied rebel forces in the region. As Reuters explains : 
'Kurdish militia have played a big role in the past year in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed umbrella group, as it has seized large areas of territory from Islamic State, laying the ground for an assault on Raqqa. 
'However, Turkey's intervention in Syria in August in support of rebel groups fighting under the Free Syrian Army (FSA) banner has complicated that equation, leading to clashes between them and Kurdish groups allied to the SDF.' 
The problem is one of trust. Turkey believes the Kurdish militants are aligned with the Kurdish PYD party, which the Turks believe is allied with Kurds within Turkey who've been waging a religious insurgency for over three decades. 
So regardless of whether the U.S. finds the Kurds useful, Turkey has made it clear it intends to sleep with one eye open for the foreseeable future. In fact, it's taking a much more proactive stance than that. 
Last Thursday, in a campaign of airstrikes that were 'the heaviest against the YPG since Turkey launched a military incursion into Syria,' Turkey targeted three Kurdish-controlled villages along the northern Syrian border. The Turkish military later confirmed it had carried out '26 strikes on areas recently taken by the Kurdish YPG militia' and 'had killed between 160 and 200 combatants.' 
Turkey's major concern is that Kurdish-controlled enclaves will physically unite, 'thereby creating a de facto Kurdish mini-state along the Turkish border.' As such, Turkey has warned Kurds to keep out of towns like Manjib, which is just northeast of the heaviest fighting in Aleppo. 
This tangled web of strained alliances and old feuds will likely only grow more confusing as the U.S.-led operation to purge ISIS from Raqqa draws nearer. In any case, Turkish President Erdogan seems to have discovered a newfound independence , and the days of him obediently — even if somewhat grudgingly — bending to the U.S. will appear to be fading, as well. 
'From now on we will now wait for problems to come knocking on our door, we will not wait until the blade is against our bone and skin, we will not wait for terrorist organizations to come and attack us,' Erdogan said from his palace last week. 'Let them go wherever until we find and destroy them. I am saying this very clearly: they will not have a single place to find peace abroad.'

Store US Government Acknowledges That al-Qaeda Is Not A Priority In Syria One might ask, then: if al-Qaeda in Syria is not a priority for the war on terror, what is? Darius Shahtahmasebi | Anti Media - October 26, 2016 Comments 
Last week, the U.S. State Department acknowledged that al-Qaeda-linked terror group Jabhat al-Nusra is not a 'priority' for the United States' efforts in Syria. 
One might ask, then: if al-Qaeda in Syria is not a priority for the war on terror, what is? 
State Department spokesman John Kirby provided some useful insight into this dilemma, stating: 
'The only thing that stands between where we are now and a permanent and enduring ceasefire in Syria is Bashar al-Assad and his supporters . We recognize Al-Nusra as a spoiler, we have concerns about co-mingling, I've talked about this ad nauseam.' 
Largely missing from the American narrative of the Syrian conflict is that al-Nusra is shelling residential areas in Aleppo, where the government holds control of the majority of Aleppo's citizens. In other parts of the world, these al-Qaeda-linked extremists are seen as the enemy, whereas in Syria, Western media will often refer to them as mere 'rebel' groups. 
The United States first officially used the term 'war on terror' on September 20, 2011, to refer to the military campaigns that followed the attacks of September 11. The stated aim at the time was to defeat Islamic-linked terrorist organizations and dismantle regimes the U.S. government accused of supporting terrorism. 
In 2013, Obama stated : 
' We must define our effort not as a boundless 'Global War on Terror,' but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America.' 
The fact that a terror group — one linked to the organization that allegedly launched an act of war against the United States on American soil — is not a priority of the United States State Department should tell you something about how farcical and ineffective the war on terror actually is. 
This change in rhetoric, which is ultimately designed to push ulterior economic agendas in the Middle East, is an insult to the thousands of soldiers who sacrificed their lives under the false pretense that they were going to protect their families from al-Qaeda-linked terrorists.

Justice Department Releases Guidelines on Controversial Anti-Hacking Law There have been several unsuccessful attempts to reform the law in recent years Image Credits: flickr, skippy . 
TO MANY WHO conduct work or research related to digital security, the legislation meant to protect against computer crimes has morphed into something harmful. The 1986 law, the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, has been repeatedly described as vague and ineffectual — allowing overzealous prosecutors to saddle hacktivists and low-level criminals with excessive sentences. 
Now, thanks to a legal challenge to the CFAA, the Department of Justice is for the first time releasing its 2014 guidelines on how prosecutors should charge computer crimes — when someone exceeds 'authorized' access on a computer. (First Look Media, the publisher of The Intercept, is a plaintiff in the case.) 
The Department of Justice acknowledges that 'laws addressing the misuse of computers have not kept pace uniformly with developments in technology and criminal schemes' though it maintains that the law remains 'important' in prosecuting cybercrimes. 
Some of the prosecutions under the CFAA have proved controversial. Aaron Swartz, a well-known internet activist who downloaded academic journals en masse, faced years of grueling legal trials under the CFAA before he committed suicide. And Andrew Auernheimer was found guilty of conspiracy to violate the CFAA by uncovering AT&T customer data exposed on the company website.

Obama Admin Targets Soldiers' Bonuses, Lets Bad VA Employees Keep Theirs Pentagon asks troops to repay bonuses, VA rewards employees after widespread problems Morgan Chalfant | Free Beacon - October 26, 2016 Comments 
The federal government is trying to recoup enlistment bonuses given erroneously to thousands of California soldiers despite routinely allowing poor-performing VA employees to keep their bonus checks. 
The Los Angeles Times reported last week that the Pentagon demanded that thousands of California soldiers repay bonuses they were given to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department asked the soldiers to repay the bonuses, which amounted to $15,000 or more each, after audits revealed they were overpaid by the California National Guard. 
But the practice stands in contrast with that of the Obama administration's Department of Veterans Affairs, which has failed to take back hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to high-ranking bureaucrats who have been scrutinized for bad behavior or poor management. 
For instance, the VA said last year it would not collect over $400,000 in bonuses paid to two senior executives who manipulated the agency's hiring system to take new jobs with less responsibility and receive relocation benefits. The VA, which acknowledged that the employees abused the system, said it did not have the legal authority to recoup the money.

California National Guard Members won't have to Pay Back Bonuses Pentagon had been seeking repayment of enlistment bonuses paid to California Guardsmen USA Today - October 26, 2016 Comments 
Defense Secretary Ash Carter ordered the Pentagon on Wednesday to stop clawing back excessive recruiting bonuses paid to California National Guardsmen. 
The move came after news broke over the weekend that the Pentagon had been seeking repayment of enlistment bonuses paid to California Guardsmen. Some of the payments were made by mistake, others were taken fraudulently. 
'While some soldiers knew or should have known they were ineligible for benefits they were claiming, many others did not,' Carter said in a statement. 'About 2,000 have been asked, in keeping with the law, to repay erroneous payments.' 
As first reported by the Los Angeles Times , the Pentagon sought repayment of the excess bonuses from almost 10,000 California Guard soldiers. The paper reported that many of the soldiers affected had served multiple combat deployments and had been ordered to repay bonuses plus interest. Some had had their wages garnished and tax liens slapped on them when they refused to pay. The bonus scandal was revealed after audits showed widespread overpayments.

Obamacare Architect Gruber Demands 'Larger Mandate Penalty' Bureaucrat who said "stupidity" of Americans helped get law passed doubles down Paul Joseph Watson - October 26, 2016 Comments 
Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber – the bureaucrat who once bragged that the 'stupidity' of the American people was crucial for passing the health care law in the first place – told CNN that the 'fix' for Obamacare was to impose a 'larger mandate penalty'. CNN's CAROL COSTELLO: 'So let's talk about how exactly you can fix Obamacare. I just need you to be specific because I think people really want answers. So Hillary Clinton says she can fix Obamacare. So what would one fix that would drive premiums down?' JONATHAN GRUBER: 'Look, once again, there's no sense it has to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think, probably the most important things experts would agree on is we need a larger mandate penalty'… Gruber's arrogance is incredible. Even after the Obama administration acknowledged that premiums are set to skyrocket next year, Gruber thinks that the answer is to financially punish Americans to an even greater degree. Gruber is essentially admitting that Obamacare is designed to make Americans destitute. 'ObamaCare was never designed *not* to overwhelm you with the shifting of massive costs. ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs,' points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments shouldn't come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people. A series of videos that emerged in 2014 featured Gruber admitting that Obamacare was deceptively crafted in order to fool 'stupid' Americans into not realizing that it would mean massive price hikes and that the law's 'lack of transparency (was) a huge political advantage' in selling it.

Will China Trigger the Next Global Recession? Current debt level causes grave concern Jing Jin | Mises.org   
China's debt growth rate has become the focus of some discussions and, fair enough, from comparing the outright levels, it may seem that China can collapse at any moment. 
Daniel Fernandez suggested this in his article ' Has China Reached Its Debt Limit? ' in Mises Wire . In response to the government's monetary expansion stimulus plan after the 2008 financial crisis, China's corporate sector did indeed leverage up quickly, followed by an equally fast pace of leveraging in the household sector. However, in order to avoid comparing apples with oranges, we need to take a closer look by putting these numbers into perspective. Using the same data source as used by Fernandez, we find that China's total debt as a percentage of GDP was 254 percent by the end of 2015. Debt-to-GDP ratio of corporate, government, and household sectors stood at 170 percent, 44 percent, and 40 percent respectively. 
For government and household sectors, both started from considerably low levels until the last administration kicked in a four-trillion yuan (RMB) stimulus plan in 2009. Government debt-to-GDP ratio, which was kept in the mid 30s in the first decade of this millennium, now stood at 44 percent by the end of 2015. Household's debt-to-GDP ratio was at 11 percent in 2006 and almost doubled to 19 percent in 2007 and then doubled again to 40 percent by the end of 2015. The leveraging up of households happened exactly as the Chinese society was undergoing rapid urbanization as well as when the government launched its 2009 stimulus. 
Apart from the demand for urban housing, Chinese households, with their high savings rate and extra cash in hands, invested in in real estate as a hedge against future inflation. Furthermore, as the stimulus package allowed for easier lending, household debt increased dramatically. However, we must note that although the debt growth rate was high, the absolute debt level of household is still considerably low versus global peers. 
The most disturbing trend is found in the corporate sector, with the debt-to-GDP ratio increased from approximately 110 percent prior to 2009 to 170 percent by the end of 2015. First of all, the level of corporate debt (mostly in the form of bank loans) was high to start with, but is by no means out of the norm for a financial system dominated by the banking sector, whose funding source is mostly deposits. Two figures from Jonathan Anderson's How To Think About China series provide some insights: 1 
An international comparison of assets of banking system vs. domestic saving rate: 
Breakdown of assets of China's financial system: 
This point can be further demonstrated by comparing financial asset structures, for example, between the US and China. Obviously bank loans are the dominant funding source of the corporate sector in China, whereas in the US the role of bank loans is far from prominent in comparison with its enormous capital markets, where the corporates can raise both equities and bond financing easily. 
Financial asset structure: US vs. China (2015): 
Data source: The World Bank, Federal Reserve Bank, Shanghai Stock Exchange, Shenzhen Stock Exchange, China Central Deposit and Clearing, Co. Ltd. (CCDC), SIFMA 
It is, therefore, not surprising that the leveraging up as a response to government's stimulus plan manifested itself mostly in the credit extension through the banking system. China's Flat Yield Curve 
The large role of the banks can also be seen in China's bond market yields, and one manifestation of this is a flat yield curve . The reason for this is simple: deposits. When banks have more deposits to manage than they can lend out, they invest these deposits into the bond market and usually on the long end to boost yields. This investment strategy (or asset-liability management scheme) bids up the bond prices on the long end, hence pushing down the long-term yields. 
In addition, between allocating deposits to these two types of assets (bonds vs. loans), banks sometimes have incentives to invest in bonds, rather than lending, due to the balancing considerations of corporate demand, credit risks, market liquidity, and yields (that are also subject to interest rate controls that are at final stage of liberalization and the lending rate was completely liberalized only in early 2016). So the yield spread, at current stage, reflects more of the combination of China's financial structure and capital flows rather than being a good indicator of economic fundamentals. As the government flooded the market with four trillion RMB from the stimulus plan in 2009, bond yields faced downward pressure, more so at the long-term end. Please see the yields of Chinese government treasury bonds at maturity (10 years vs. 1 year) and the spread thereof in the below figure. Wealth management products channel a considerable amount of deposits out of the banking system to capture higher yields outside of banking-sector supervision (in form of trusts, for example), but the amount is still not pivotal enough to change the above explained pattern in a fundamental manner. 
Data source: WIND, CCDC 
China didn't open up to the outside world until the very late 1970s. Now China provides half of the manufacturing goods and close to half of electronic products in the world and the economy is still growing at around 6 percent. Obviously a good part of China's production structure has been configured to export, mostly to the developed economies, which are dominated by the service sector. As the global demand in the developed economies lost its momentum, China faces the necessity of reconfiguring its economic structure to better serve its domestic consumers (which stands at 4 times the number of US consumers). This reconfiguration process is surely painful as demonstrated by the empty factories in the traditional export production oriented cities. But to me, this is more of a textbook case of Austrian economics at work. Capital and labor have to be freed up for those productions currently being demanded by the market. And this takes time. Moreover, quick capital formation in the past three decades lifted labor productivity, with which the manufacturing sector needs to be upgraded and the tertiary sector needs to be expanded to serve a more affluent society comparing with more than 30 years ago, so that Chinese consumers don't have to go to Japan to buy hi-tech toilet lids . A Healthier Skepticism of 'Stimulus' 
Needless to say, the current debt level causes concern and the deeper concern is whether debt growth trajectory will continue. Ultimately, whether or not the debt will grow at the rate of post 2008 stimulus phase is a function of how fast the Chinese government runs the money printing press. A recent article on the People's Daily — the mouthpiece of China Communist Party (CCP) — quoted the diagnosis from an 'authoritative figure' on the Chinese economy and its cure. This 'authoritative figure' suggested there should be no more money printing to stimulate the economy and that the Chinese should be prepared for a lower growth rate (comparing with its own historical average of 10 percent). Anyone with an understanding of China's political messaging system would not be mistake it for anything but an opinion handed down from the very top of Chinese leadership. This can be considered a concluding remark on the policy swings for the past several years. 
The Xinhua News Agency, the mainstream media group, recently followed with a commentary suggesting resistance to the use of stimulus plans in the face of slowing growth. Xinhua also warned of a disastrous result if its advice is not followed. Messages like these are refreshing to hear nowadays among the mantra of the stimulus chorus around the world. How China's policy direction is to be implemented remains to be seen, but at least the insidious effects of stimulus is well recognized by those at the top of the regime and openly represented by mainstream media. In addition, a series of measures to lower tax burdens for corporate and households alike are also being introduced, and the central government is pushing hard for business-friendly deregulations and increasing economic freedom. 
China has its problems; tons of them. China may or may not be the first to blow up in the coming wave of crises, as many people say. No matter whichever the case, I am more convinced that China will be among the first ones to revive — because it has high savings to invest, it has a well-trained labor force with one of the most vibrant, if not the most complete, manufacturing chain, and the manufacturing sector still contributes to over 40 percent of its GDP. It is still in the middle of a rapid urbanization process. It is not yet a welfare state. Chinese people are fully aware of the fact that their safety net is the result of their own frugality rather than government promises. China has the biggest potential market of 1.3 billion people with a rising middle-class that is still increasing in numbers and share in population. Serving them well is one of the biggest business opportunities in the 21st century.

Get Ready For Civil Unrest: Survey Finds That Most Americans Are Concerned About Election Violence Time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it Michael Snyder | Economic Collapse - October 27, 2016 Comments 
Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th? Let's hope that it doesn't happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. 
If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. 
At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned 'about the possibility of violence' on election day… 
A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are 'very concerned.' Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are 'very confident' about that. 
More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they won't recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn't have won fair and square. 
But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trump's star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax… 
Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. 
And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trump's star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June … 
This is of course not the first time the GOP candidate's star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trump's star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trump's star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. 
We have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted 'Nazi Republicans get out of town or else' along with a swastika. 
There have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece… 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, 'Why can't they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?' 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. 'The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by 'some thugs' that a barmaid called out from the back.' Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a 'Blue Lives Matter' shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a 'Make America Great Again' baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Let's certainly hope that we don't see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. 
Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. 
For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is 'grabbing my musket' if Donald Trump loses the election… 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, 'On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. You in?' 
And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today … 
'Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, I've been buying a lot more ammunition,' says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigan's Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to 'declare martial law and take our guns away' after the election. 
Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. 
Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . 
If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton's political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. 
And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month … 
As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. 
But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . 
Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. 
Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP

Store Guardian Front Page: 'A 16-Year-Old Migrant Cries…' This image of a "16-year-old" migrant crying – which is currently plastered on the front page of The Guardian – is nothing short of laughable Chris Menahan | Information Liberation - October 27, 2016 Comments 
Won't you take pity on this poor, innocent little child? 
This image of a '16-year-old' migrant crying – which is currently plastered on the front page of The Guardian – is nothing short of laughable. 
'A 16-year-old from Ethiopia cries while he awaits registration at a processing centre in the makeshift refugee camp near Calais,' the photo's caption reads. The image is placed under a headline reading: 'Councils resist pressure to take children from Calais.' 

This crying 'child' is supposed to make Brits feel guilty and demand their government allow 'children' like him into their nation. 
The image is not a fake, nor is it being used satirically. It comes from the Associated Press' Emilio Morenatti , you can see four pictures of the man for sale on their website . 
The 'child migrant' is clearly in his 40's, yet their editors evidently believe their readers are so incredibly stupid they'll actually believe they're looking at a 16-year-old boy.

Clinton Campaign Circulated Paul Ryan Relative as Possible Supreme Court Pick Another reason as to why Ryan tried to sabotage Trump's campaign? Paul Joseph Watson - October 27, 2016 Comments Hillary Clinton's campaign circulated the name of one of Paul Ryan's relatives as a potential Supreme Court pick, suggesting a conflict of interest that could feed in to the Republican Speaker of the House's dislike for Donald Trump. An email released in part 19 of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features an article sent by Hillary advisor Sara Solow to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and Hillary's foreign policy advisor Jake Sullivan on February 29, 2016. The piece draws attention to Ketanji Brown Jackson, a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. 'She was confirmed by without any Republican opposition in the Senate not once, but *twice*. She was confirmed to her current position in 2013 by unanimous consent – that is, without any stated opposition. She was also previously confirmed unanimously to a seat on the U.S. Sentencing Commission (where she became vice chair),' reads the email. 'Her family is impressive. She is married to a surgeon and has two young daughters. Her father is a retired lawyer and her mother a retired school principal. Her brother was a police officer (in the unit that was the basis for the television show *The Wire*) and is now a law student, and she is related by marriage to Congressman (and Speaker of the House) Paul Ryan.' Earlier this month, Ryan said that he would no longer defend or campaign for Donald Trump. A poll released this week found that nearly two thirds of Republicans trust Donald Trump more than Ryan to lead the GOP. Many Trump supporters speculated that Ryan was involved in the leaking of the infamous Billy Bush tape, in which Trump made lewd comments about women, as part of a plot to sabotage the Republican nominee's campaign. Could the fact that one of his relatives is being touted as a likely Clinton Supreme Court pick be another reason as to why Ryan – who has been accused by many of being in bed with the Washington establishment – has abandoned his support for Donald Trump?

Video: 'Rude' CNN Reporter Asks Trump Why He's Taking Time Off To Open A Hotel Meanwhile Hillary Clinton is at home sleeping Steve Watson | Infowars.com   
GOP nominee Donald Trump took time out of a relentless campaign schedule Wednesday to spend around an hour opening a new hotel, prompting one CNN reporter to accuse Trump of 'taking time out of swing states.' Meanwhile Hillary Clinton is again nowhere to be seen. 
CNN's Dana Bash suggested that Trump should be more concerned with campaigning in swing states, yet Trump had three campaign stops scheduled for the same day. Dana Bash: Is your DC hotel opening free advertising?Donald Trump: 'No, not at all' https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/9HHqooom8r 
— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 26, 2016 
'So to people who say you're taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?' Bash asked. 
'I say the following: You have been covering me for the last — long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I've been doing this for weeks straight,' Trump responded. 
'For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you'll ask me that question. I think that's a very rude question, to be honest with you.' Trump exclaimed. 
Trump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule, suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit. 
While CNN has continuously run defense for Hillary Clinton amid a myriad of scandals, and even rigged its own polls to suggest she won the debates, the network has been forced to admit that Hillary is running an extremely light campaign schedule. 
Last month, for example, Hillary went six days without an event except for a short speech she gave in Orlando, Florida. 
And in August, Hillary took seven of the first 14 days of the month off and even went four days without a single campaign appearance. 
'Her speeches are so short – they don't last long, they're like 10 minutes and 'let's get out of here,'' Donald Trump said about her schedule. 'Go back home and go to sleep.' NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew. Related Articles

Trump Warns Of 'Vote Flipping' On Machines "People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?" Steve Watson | Infowars.com - October 27, 2016 Comments 
GOP Nominee Donald Trump, who has for weeks warned that the election could be rigged against him, shot out a tweet Thursday indicating that he is aware of reports of machines 'flipping' to register votes for Hillary Clinton, when voters choose Trump. 
'A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas,' Trump tweeted. 
'People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?' A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on? 
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2016 
As Infowars has highlighted , there have already been numerous reports of early voters in Texas seeing their ballots flipped from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. 
While election officials have dismissed the reports, suggesting 'user error' is to blame, tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time. 
Larry Norden, a voting technology expert, told NPR that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed. 
'Over time, as people vote, that calibration becomes less and less accurate,' Norden noted. 
During elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines 'flipping'. Indeed, the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as The Simpsons drew attention to it: 
Meanwhile, The Washington Post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression, bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering Trump's 'rigged' election claims. 
Callum Borchers, author at the Washington Post blog The Fix writes: Since the final presidential debate last week, many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to Donald Trump supporters: Your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election Nov. 8. A day later, the Times's Upshot blog increased Clinton's chances of winning to 93 percent , an all-time high. On Monday, Politico's Ben Schreckinger wrote that ' Donald Trump's path to an election night win is almost entirely closed .' Here at The Fix, Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake wrote that ' Donald Trump's chances of winning are approaching zero .' These are accurate, statistically sound statements. But they are something else, too. Declarations that Trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the Republican nominee's warning that the 'rigged' election could be ' stolen from us .' 
The latest polls, which Trump insists are rigged due to oversampling, show Clinton with a double digit lead. 
However, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook has warned that Trump's suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are 'absolutely right.' 
'We've seen polls tighten since the third debate and we expect things to get even closer before Election Day.' Mook said, urging Clinton supporters to vote. 
'Make no mistake. With only 10 percent of votes cast, Donald Trump could win this election,' Mook said. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew. Related Articles

Store Exclusive: Christ's Burial Place Exposed for First Time in Centuries Restorers working in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Israel uncover stone slab venerated as the resting place of Jesus Christ Image Credits: Wiki Commons . 
For the first time in centuries, scientists have exposed the original surface of what is traditionally considered the tomb of Jesus Christ. Located in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City of Jerusalem, the tomb has been covered by marble cladding since at least 1555 A.D., and most likely centuries earlier. 
'The marble covering of the tomb has been pulled back, and we were surprised by the amount of fill material beneath it,' said Fredrik Hiebert, archaeologist-in-residence at the National Geographic Society, a partner in the restoration project. 'It will be a long scientific analysis, but we will finally be able to see the original rock surface on which, according to tradition, the body of Christ was laid.' 
According to Christian tradition, the body of Jesus Christ was laid on a shelf or 'burial bed' hewn from the side of a limestone cave following his crucifixion by the Romans in A.D. 30 or possibly 33. Christian belief says Christ was resurrected after death, and women who came to anoint his body three days after the burial reported that no remains were present.

Three Quarters Of Americans Oppose Gun Control Record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban Steve Watson | Infowars.com - October 27, 2016 Comments 
A new poll released by Gallup has found that a record amount of Americans are opposed to gun control measures . 
The survey found that 76 percent of respondents, over three quarters, believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law. 
The findings represent a four-point increase on the same survey from last year, in addition to an all-time high for the past three decades. 
The poll also found that almost two thirds, 61 percent, are 'against' a ban on semi-automatic rifles, or 'assault weapons'as the corporate media refers to them. 
That figure represents a full ten-point increase on previous findings, and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue 20 years ago. 
Just 27 percent, less than a third, say they support a ban on handgun ownership, while only 36 percent, support a semi-automatic ban. an eight-point decline on previous findings. 
In addition, gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end. 
In a summary of the new poll, Gallup seemed surprised, by the findings, describing waning support for a gun ban as a 'paradox': 
Perhaps paradoxically, opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles. These guns were used in high-profile incidents, including the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, and the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut. 
The findings reveal just how out of step Hillary Clinton's position on gun control is with the majority of Americans. 
Hillary is a staunch gun control proponent. Wikileaks releases have revealed that Hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order. 
Clinton purportedly plans to open gun manufacturers to lawsuits by crime victims, a move that critics say would do nothing to reduce crime, but would bankrupt–and eventually end–gun manufacturing in the United States.

Wikileaks Email: Clinton Operative Thinks 'Black Voters Are Stupid' David Brock accused of "elitist racism" Paul Joseph Watson - October 27, 2016 Comments A new email released as part of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accusing Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being 'stupid'. The email , sent to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and another Clinton ally CEO Roy Spence, centers around a discussion of a Bernie Sanders campaign ad which featured 'many black faces'. Back in January, Clinton operative David Brock caused consternation within the campaign when he publicly claimed that Bernie Sanders didn't care about black people. Budowsky is not impressed with Brock's outburst, writing in the email, 'Brock makes the cardinal mistake of those who bring politics into disrepute with voters. He tells a lie that people will know is a lie, and insults the intelligence of black voters with a kind of elitist racism that Bill and Hillary Clinton should not be seen with.' 'I guess Brock's plan is that black voters are stupid and will not watch the ad and believe his lie,' writes Budowsky. 'I cannot think of anything more desperate, more stupid and more self-destructive than David Brock lying about the Bernie ad and playing a seamy brand of the politics of race using the tactic of deceit on her behalf,' adds the The Hill and Huffington Post columnist, before offering to write a campaign ad for HIllary to counter the Bernie Sanders ad. The email once again underscores the Clinton camp's paranoia about not being able to authentically connect with African-American voters in a way that Bernie Sanders could. Some black voters have been reluctant to support Clinton as a result of her support for a 1994 crime bill that resulted in the mass incarceration of young black Americans, whom Hilary referred to at the time as 'super predators'.

Chinese University Sells HIV Testing Kits in Vending Machine China has a 43% year-over-year increase of the disease Image Credits: David Pursehouse/Flickr . 
China has experienced such a growth rate of HIV in the past several years that one university has taken steps to allow students to test themselves: by placing an HIV testing kit in a vending machine next to regular fare like snacks. 
China has seen a 43% year-over-year increase in infection rates, which likely prompted Southwest Petroleum University in Nanchong City in Sichuan Province to install the test kits . 
Sichuan Province is one of the top three provinces in China with a disproportionately high rate of HIV/AIDS. Together, with the other two provinces that have high rates of the disease, the three account for over half of the cases of HIV/AIDS in the entire country. 
80% of new HIV cases occur due to homosexual activity. 
The kits retail for $4.40 and can be taken as a urine test to determine whether or not students need to seek medical attention. Those who purchase the test will collect their urine and send it to a laboratory, and then access the results online. This can all be done completely anonymously. 
Similar kits can be purchased online, but they retail for around $45. The cheaper vending machine tests are just as accurate and are partially subsidized by a charity to allow the test to be more accessible. 
Reports state that the Chinese have limited sex education and very little is discussed about HIV or AIDS. Many students who suspect they may have the disease do not seek medical help because of its link to homosexuality. Those who do have HIV are often thought to be pariahs by their families and friends because of its connection with same-sex encounters. 
The disease is mostly spreading amongst young homosexual men, but as with anywhere else, women who do not use proper protection are also susceptible to becoming infected. 
Doctors have stated that most young people who have become infected with HIV/AIDS in China lacked proper education and did not take appropriate precautions for prevention. 
The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) states that there are currently about half a million people in China living with HIV or AIDS, however this figure may be inaccurate due to underreporting.

US-led Coalition Killed 300 Civilians in just 11 Air Strikes in Syria, Amnesty International Report Finds Group calls on authorities to 'come clean' about full extent of casualties and damage Image Credits: BBC . 
At least 300 civilians have been killed in just 11 air strikes by the US-led coalition, a report has found amid concern for families trapped in Isis' stronghold of Mosul. 
Amnesty International urged the Pentagon and its allies to 'come clean' about the full extent of deaths in operations against the so-called Islamic State, with official inquiries so far acknowledging only dozens of casualties. 
Assessing reports from the ground, eyewitness interviews, satellite imagery, photos and video footage, investigators said US Central Command (Centcom) may have 'failed to take necessary precautions to spare civilians and carried out unlawful attacks' in Syria. 
The 11 coalition attacks reviewed by Amnesty include strikes during operations to drive Isis out of Manbij over the summer, when more than 100 civilians, including children, where reportedly killed in the villages of al-Tukhar , al-Hadhadh and al-Ghandoura in their homes and at a market.

Public Faith in Elections Falls as the State Grows Out-of-control state power Ryan McMaken | Mises.org - October 27, 2016 Comments 
In the wake of the final presidential election debate last week, the mainstream media was appalled that Donald Trump would not pre-emptively agree to not contest the outcome of the election . 
Trump's position reflects a growing faction of Americans who doubt the integrity and honesty of the American electoral system. In response, mainstream media sources have responded by vehemently insisting that 'rigged' elections are ' a myth .' 
While rarely stated explicitly, the way American electoral politics is supposed to work is this: the population spends several months listening to the candidates accuse each other of terrible crimes, horrible ideas, and gross incompetence. Each candidate lists the ways he or she will use the power of government to force the winner's policy preferences on the losers. Then, once the votes are cast, everyone is supposed to quickly accept the results, ignore everything that was said during the campaign, and immediately accept the winner as having an indisputable mandate to rule over everyone, including the sizable minority — or even the majority, in many cases — who either voted against the winner, or abstained. If there appears to be any 'irregularities' in the vote, well, those should just be ignored because it would 'tear the country apart' to 'drag out' the election. If half the country feels it's been cheated, well, tough luck and better luck next time. Democracy Breaks Down As (Perceived) Interventionism Increases 
This model can only work indefinitely under certain specific conditions. It can be workable when there is a perception that government is limited in its power, and extensive or abrupt change to government institutions are thought to be rare. It can also work in a small, culturally uniform society where there is a relatively small divide between socio-economic and ethnic groups. 
In the case of the United States, however, it appears that neither of these conditions apply. 
In the age of presidential executive orders, militarized police, uncountable federal laws, and a myriad of spy agencies empowered to watch Americans' every move, gone is the perception that a loss in an electoral contest should simply be accepted without question. The president says he can issue laws with ' a pen and … a phone ' without any need to consult Congress. The Libya war proved presidents can invade any country without so much as a debate in Congress. Meanwhile, the untouchable Supreme Court hands down decisions that are equivalent to Constitutional amendments, some of which can have enormous effects on the daily lives of ordinary citizens. 
In other words, the stakes are now reaching the point where an attitude of 'better luck next time' doesn't cut it. Whether or not these fears are at times overstated is irrelevant. The fact is the perception of democratic lawlessness is growing. 
This situation is further complicated by the fact that the United States is an enormous conglomeration of different cultural and socio-economic groups spread out over a vast and varied geography. Many of these different groups distrust each other, and in a country where the president and the judiciary now rule largely by proclamation, there is reason to be fearful when 'the other guy's' candidate wins and yours loses. Democracy Can Work When the Stakes Are Low 
Contrary to the naive musings of some nostalgic conservatives, the United States was never united into a single cultural, linguistic, or socio-economic group. Those differences may have reached a low point during the twentieth century, but they were far larger in the 19th century than they are today. 
When you have a diverse population, however, the problem of who controls the government becomes far more important, and this concern grows as the state becomes more powerful. Writing on the topic of immigration and nationalism in Australia , Ludwig von Mises noted how powerful states exacerbate the problem of cultural divides. Could a laissez-faire regime be guaranteed to all residents of Australia, Mises notes, it would not matter at all if there were cultural mistrust between English-descended Australians and Asian newcomers. However, since laissez-faire liberalism has not been embraced, a familiar problem presented itself: 
The present inhabitants of [Australia] fear that some day they could be reduced to a minority in their own country and that they would then have to suffer all the horrors of national persecution to which, for instance, the Germans are today [i.e., the early 1920s] exposed in Czechoslovakia, Italy, and Poland. 
It cannot be denied that these fears are justified. Because of the enormous power that today stands at the command of the state, a national minority must expect the worst from a majority of a different nationality. As long as the state is granted the vast powers which it has today and which public opinion considers to be its right, the thought of having to live in a state whose government is in the hands of members of a foreign nationality is positively terrifying. It is frightful to live in a state in which at every turn one is exposed to persecution — masquerading under the guise of justice — by a ruling majority. It is dreadful to be handicapped even as a child in school on account of one's nationality and to be in the wrong before every judicial and administrative authority because one belongs to a national minority… 
It is clear that no solution of the problem of immigration is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state, which meddles in every field of human activity, or to that of the socialist state. Only the adoption of the liberal program could make the problem of immigration, which today seems insoluble, completely disappear. In an Australia governed according to liberal principles, what difficulties could arise from the fact that in some parts of the continent Japanese and in other parts Englishmen were in the majority? 
These same principles can be applied outside the subject of immigration as well. The existence of an interventionist state means any country composed of diverse ethnic and socioeconomic groups faces the same problem of one group being exploited by another group, with the help of state power. Change the term 'nationality' to 'political party' or 'interest groups,' and one has a fair approximation of the problem of democracy in any interventionist state. 
In the presence of a relatively weak government, however, these concerns are often overstated. At the turn of the 20th century in the US, for example, the fact that Spanish-speakers were in the majority in New Mexico and many areas of the American West was irrelevant to the lives of the vast majority of Americans. The fact that Japanese immigrants and their descendant were out-competing white businessmen in California was simply not a matter of national importance. The fact that Oregon attempted to outlaw Catholic Schools was not a matter for presidential executive orders. Thanks to widespread suspicion of federal power at the time, the lack of a strong federal judiciary and a relatively weak presidency meant these issues remained largely local while public policy was haphazard. 
Voters have always feared losses in elections, but now more than ever, the voters may be justified in refusing to simply accept the outcomes of elections under 'an interventionist state, which meddles in every field of human activity.' When that is the case, elections are not something to be taken lightly. Trump's remarks about rigged elections — and public fears over the outcome — are to be expected from voters with an immense fear of out-of-control state power. 
In response to all of this, the pundits and government class will tell us that everyone must double down on democracy, and that elections — specifically federal ones —are sacred rituals never to be questioned. There will be a double standard, of course. A Trump victory will be questioned by the media and powerful politicians. But, in that case it will be the fault of the Russians , and not anything wrong with the system itself. The solution for the feds, of course, will be a federal takeover of the election system. If Clinton wins, then no questioning of the system will be tolerated at all. To question the outcome or the wisdom of these presidential contests will be denounced as scarcely less than sacrilege. 
The true solution to the problem remains far more practical, however. To paraphrase Mises, it is clear that no solution of the problem of elections is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state. So long as elections are increasingly perceived to be referenda on which side shall use the power of the state to crush the other side, faith in the electoral system will erode, and the potential for real violence will increase.

WHO Cancer Agency Under Fire for withholding 'carcinogenic glyphosate' Documents IARC urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its 2015 weedkiller glyphosate review RT.com - October 27, 2016 Comments 
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), facing criticism over its classification of carcinogens, has reportedly been advising its scientific experts not to publish internal research data on its 2015 report on 'probably carcinogenic' glyphosate. 
The IARC urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its 2015 weedkiller glyphosate review, according to Reuters. The agency told Reuters on Tuesday that it tried to protect the study from 'external interference,' as well as protect its intellectual rights, since it was 'the sole owner of such materials.' 
The scientists had been asked earlier to release all the documentation on the 2015 report under US freedom of information laws. 
The groundbreaking review, published in March 2015 by the IARC – a semi-autonomous agency of the World Health Organization (WHO) – labeled the glyphosate herbicide as 'probably carcinogenic to humans.' Glyphosate is a key ingredient of Monsanto's flagship weedkiller well-known under the trade name 'Roundup.' It is one of the most heavily used herbicides in the world and is designed to go along with genetically-modified 'Roundup Ready' crops, also produced by Monsanto. 
The IARC's report caused problems for both the notorious agrochemical giant and the agency itself. 
The report sparked a heated debate around the use of Roundup, and caused several EU countries – including France, Sweden, and the Netherlands – to object to the renewal of the glyphosate's EU license. The vote on prolonging the glyphosate license for 15 years failed several times in June 2016, but the license was temporarily extended for 18 months during last hours before its expiration. 
The controversial report has seemingly made the IARC a target for attacks from multiple directions, and raised scientific, legal, and financial questions. 
Various critics, including those in the chemical industry, said the IARC's evaluations are fuel for 'unnecessary health scares,' since the IARC allegedly studies the potentially harmful substance itself, and not a 'typical human' exposure to it. It remained unclear whether the critics urged a WHO body to test the potentially carcinogenic chemical on humans. 
The critics also brought up other controversial statements from the IARC, over whether such things as mobile phones, coffee, red meat, and processed meat could cause cancer. 
The agency defended its methods as scientifically sound and 'widely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and…freedom from conflicts of interest.' Numerous freedom of information requests by the Energy & Environment Legal Institute (E&E Legal), a US conservative advocacy group, have since been turned down with this reasoning. 
E&E Legal told Reuters that it is pushing a legal challenge over whether the documents in question belong to the IARC or to the US federal and state institutions where some of the experts work. Basically, it's being decided whether the IARC, as part of the WHO, is truly independent and free from 'conflicts of interest.' 
According to Reuters, officials from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) will be questioned by a congressional committee about why American taxpayers fund the cancer agency, which faces much criticism over its allegedly faulty classification of carcinogens. 
'IARC's standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic, and therefore cancer-causing, appear inconsistent with other scientific research, and have generated much controversy and alarm,' a letter from US Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz to NIH director Francis Collins states, as quoted by Reuters. 
The Oversight Committee demanded a full disclosure of NIH funding of the IARC, and even money spent in relation to the cancer agency's activities. 
IARC opponents from scientific circles vowed to provide their data on the matter. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which believes glyphosate is 'unlikely pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans,' promised to release its raw data on the subject as part of its 'commitment to open risk assessment.' The food safety watchdog made this statement in late September, and still has to deliver the promised information.

AIDS 'Patient Zero' Not the Source of the Outbreak Although responsible somewhat for the spread of AIDS, he didn't bring it to the US Image Credits: frolicsomepl/Pixabay . 
Scientists have managed to reconstruct the route by which HIV/Aids arrived in the US – exonerating once and for all the man long blamed for the ensuing pandemic in the west. 
Using sophisticated genetic techniques, an international team of researchers have revealed that the virus emerged from a pre-existing epidemic in the Caribbean, arrived in New York by the early 1970s and then spread westwards across the US. 
The research also confirms that Gaétan Dugas, a French-Canadian flight attendant, was not the first person in the US to be infected, despite being dubbed 'Patient zero' in a study of gay men with Aids in 1984. Based on that study, author Randy Shilts named Dugas in 1987 and wrote that 'there's no doubt that Gaëtan played a key role in spreading the new virus from one end of the United States to the other.'

Vitamin D Deficiency, Dirty Air Doubles Your Risk of Dementia 1 in 4 Americans will struggle with Alzheimer's by 2050 Image Credits: geralt/Pixabay . 
Dementia is one of the most common and debilitating illnesses that older Americans face today. 
However, recent studies have suggested that air pollution may be one of the top causes for the contribution of the disease's growth. 
By 2050, 1 in 4 Americans will suffer from Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's is the most potent form of dementia, and often ends in the patient unable to remember how to do daily and necessary tasks like eating or using the restroom. This will rival the current diabetes and obesity crises seen today. 
Recent studies have confirmed that a variety of environmental factors are at play when it comes to dementia. 
Doctors have noted that those who are deficient in vitamin D are 125% more likely to develop dementia than those who get in the necessary amount. 
A vitamin D deficiency can also be associated with brittle or soft bones as well as depression. It is recommended that everyone gets at least 10 minutes of sunlight per day in order to ensure they have enough vitamin D, as well as eat fortified dairy products or salmon, liver and red meat. Vitamin D can also be obtained through supplementation or fish oil. 
However, doctors have found that the biggest environmental risk for dementia lies in air pollution. 
In fact, the problem is so great that those who live in a city with high pollution can double their risk of develop dementia within 1 or 2 months living there. 
Recent studies have also shown that post-mortem examinations of the brains of those who have lived in highly polluted areas contain traces of magnetite. This chemical compound may be partially responsible for the memory impairments associated with dementia. 
The risk of developing dementia if you are exposed to air pollution increases exponentially if you are obese. 
Researchers say that those concerned about the epidemic can combat it by living somewhere with as little pollution as possible, maintaining a health intake of vitamin D and exercising. 
According to research, exercise is imperitive when it comes to staving off the illness. Dr. Laura Baker, who ran a study on dementia and exercise stated: 
'These findings are important because they strongly suggest a potent lifestyle intervention such as aerobic exercise can impact Alzheimer's-related changes in the brain. No currently approved medication can rival these effects.' NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew. Related Articles

How A Communist Brainwashing Method Came To The US CIA learns from communists Image Credits: Luo Shaoyang via Flickr . 
During the height of the Cold War, the CIA attempted to develop mind control techniques with the MKULTRA program. 
As it happens, the Communists already had a leg up on them. We'll explore how this was done, along with some new twists. 
The criticism and self-criticism technique in history 
The technique of 'criticism and self-criticism' (kritika i samokritika) was developed during the early days of the Soviet Union. This got results. When the early Soviet show trials and purges took place, the targets would confess to committing treason—the details stretching credulity—and beg for execution. The Maoists (Chinese Communists) used it too, typically during 'struggle sessions.' Also, forced confessions were required in Vietnam for prisoners in reeducation camps. 
What happened wasn't much different from a medieval inquisition. Those targeted would be badgered until they confessed to whatever it was they supposedly did. Of course, physical forms of coercion were also an option. These weren't actual trials; their fates were already decided.

Trump And His Supporters Are Fighting A Rigged System The elite realize that their time is short Image Credits: donaldjtrump.com . 
At the third debate, Donald Trump was asked if he would accept the results of the election. 
Trump responded that he would have to look at the process to determine if everything was done fairly before he could accept it. The media went berserk claiming that Trump was undermining democracy. But is the US system really rigged? And if it is, can Trump overcome it? 
Why rig the system? 
Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. Revelation 12:12 
It is human nature to want to accumulate wealth. It is also human nature to want to keep what you have. One of the ways that the wealthy do that is through influencing the political process to ensure it is favorable to them. A democratic republic is particularly easy to influence. The wealthy elite can 'buy' candidates through donations to them or to their superpacs.

7 Wikileaks Hillary Revelations The Media Won't Cover Trump should win based on Hillary's corruption alone David G. Brown | Return of Kings - October 27, 2016 Comments 
The recent Wikileaks revelations about the Clintons, the Clinton campaign, media collusion, and the various hypocrisies of the Democratic Party are groundbreaking in both their scope and depth. 
The sheer number of hacked emails covering so many topics, combined with the shadiness of the activities involved, should have already handed Donald Trump the election. 
Alas, the media, whose collusion with the Clinton campaign is laid out in many of the emails, will not have a bar of reporting them in a professional, ethical fashion. The following seven email exchanges have either been deliberately suppressed by mainstream outlets or given the slimmest coverage to feebly ward off accusations that they are in the de facto service (or pocket) of Hillary Clinton. 
1. 'Women's advocate' Hillary Clinton admits that Saudi Arabia and Qatar fund ISIS, but refuses to rebuke them for it 
After rounding on Donald Trump for very tamely calling former Miss Universe Alicia Machado 'Miss Piggy,' one might think that Hillary Clinton has the interests of women at heart. Her admission that Saudi Arabia and Qatar fund female-enslaving ISIS tells another story.

Assange claims 'crazed' Clinton campaign tried to hack WikiLeaks The whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from Clinton's campaign chair RT - October 27, 2016 Comments 
Julian Assange has claimed the Hillary Clinton campaign has attacked the servers being used by WikiLeaks. 
Despite the Ecuadorian embassy shutting down his internet until the US election is over, the website will continue publishing, according to Assange. 
'Everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict,' Assange said via telephone at a conference in Argentina on Wednesday. 
The whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta, on a daily basis since early October. 
Assange claimed the release 'whipped up a crazed hornet's nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign' leading them to attack WikiLeaks. 
' They attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile,' he added. 
Ecuador's decision to shut down his internet was described by Assange as a 'strategic position' so that its 'policy of non-intervention can't be misinterpreted by actors in the US and even domestically in Ecuador.' 
He said he was sympathetic with Ecuador, insisting they face the dilemma of having the US interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the US elections next month. 
Assange, who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference, said he did not agree with Ecuador's decision but did understand it. WikiLeaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from Ecuador, he said. 
He did, however, reject the idea that WikiLeaks is interfering with the US election, claiming, 'this is not the interference of electoral process, this is the definition of electoral process – for media organizations and, in fact, everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring. It cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform.' 
He also attacked US TV networks, many of whom he accused of being 'controlled by Clinton supporters.' 
The Podesta emails will make no difference to the election result, according to Assange. 'I don't think there's any chance of Donald Trump winning the election, even with the amazing material we are publishing, because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with Hillary Clinton,' he said. 
Assange said journalists and people who work in the media are predominantly middle class and view Trump as representing 'what in their mind is white trash.' NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew. Related Articles

Exclusive: Dem Senator's Private Email Hacked DCLeaks obtains emails of Colorado Democratic Senator Andy Kerr Mikael Thalen - October 27, 2016 Comments 
Infowars has exclusively learned that the email account of Colorado Democratic Senator Andy Kerr has been hacked. 
The emails, shown to Infowars by the website DCLeaks, include hundreds of discussions from March 2015 to July 2016 – with one email concerning 2015 marijuana legislation oddly claiming to be from December of 2000. 
Taken from Kerr's Gmail account, the emails, which are currently password protected, mostly surround requests and comments by Kerr's constituents on a wide range of political topics. 
Speaking with Infowars, David Pourshoushtari, communications director for the Colorado State Senate Democrats, said Kerr was unaware of the hack but that the senator declined to provide an official statement until the situation could be assessed. 
While the exact reasoning behind the hack is currently unknown, Kerr may have been targeted as part of the same hacking campaign that compromised the emails of other political figures including Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta. 
It is also unclear whether Kerr, like Podesta, fell victim to a phishing attack that would have resulted in the senator putting his email password into a fake Google login page. 
Earlier this month the former Chief of Protocol of the United States, Capricia Marshall, who was one of Clinton's insiders at the State Department, similarly had her emails appear on DCLeaks. 
The website also made headlines in August after publishing hundreds of documents connected to billionaire donor George Soros. 
According to the U.S. government and many in the cybersecurity community , Russian state hackers are responsible for the recent spate of election season hacks. DCLeaks has similarly been accused of being a publishing front for the Russian government. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

ABC Poll Oversamples Dems by 9%, Claims Hillary Leading Mainstream media oversampling Democrats to create fake Hillary lead Kit Daniels - October 27, 2016 Comments 
In another example of poll rigging, an ABC presidential poll surveyed 9% more Democrats than Republicans and showed Hillary Clinton leading by 12% – with a 3% sampling error! 
ABC claims it's a '12-point race' with Clinton ahead after polling a 'random' national sample of 1,155 likely voters, but the poll's methodology reveals the poll was heavily biased in favor of Hillary. 
'Results have a margin of sampling error of 3 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 36-27-31 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents,' ABC said near the bottom of the poll. 
Of course Hillary will be ahead in polls dominated by Democrats, but ABC and other mainstream media outlets are betting that voters won't bother to look at a poll's methodology to find the bias. 
Even if there's more registered Democrats than Republicans nationally, they don't outnumber them by nearly 10% because otherwise Republicans wouldn't be winning national races. 
'These kind of misleading polls really strike at their credibility as pollsters,' wrote media analyst Aaron Rossiter. 'They seem to want the big Hillary lead, probably to throw off the poll averages and suppress Republican voter turnout.' 
And if the fact that mainstream polls are 'adjusted' to manufacture a Hillary lead still sounds doubtful to you, just read this leaked email from Democratic consultant Tom Matzzie: 
'I also want to get your Atlas folks to recommend oversamples for our polling before we start in February. By market, regions, etc. I want to get this all compiled into one set of recommendations so we can maximize what we get out of our media polling.' 
The email also includes this report from The Atlas Project on how to rig polls to get the desired result: 
For example, in Florida, a key battleground state, Democratic consultants recommended oversampling African-American and Hispanic voters who lean Democratic so the polls favor Democrat candidates: 
– General election benchmark, 800 sample, with potential over samples in key districts/regions 
– Benchmark polling in targeted races, with ethnic over samples as needed 
– Targeting tracking polls in key races, with ethnic over samples as needed

Scientists are planning to release an army of millions of modified mosquitoes in areas of Brazil and Colombia. 
They say the unusual approach is an attempt to provide 'revolutionary protection' against mosquito-borne diseases such as Zika and chikungunya. 
The mosquitoes are infected with a bug called Wolbachia which reduces their ability to spread viruses to people. 
The $18m dollar project is funded by an international team of donors, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Bill Clinton's 'Son' Danney Williams has Youtube Channel Restored Youtube had deactivated channel hosting popular documentary linking Williams to Bill Clinton Infowars.com - October 27, 2016 Comments 
Youtube has decided to reverse its ban on a channel registered by a man who claims to be Bill Clinton's long-lost son. 
'Your YouTube account was suspended due to repeated or severe violations of our Terms and our Community Guidelines, and as such cannot be restored,' the company wrote earlier this week to Danney Williams after he filed an appeal to restore his channel. 
For decades, Williams has been on a mission to reunite with the person he believes to be his biological father, the 42nd President of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton. 
The most popular video on the channel , a nine-minute mini-documentary posted two weeks ago produced by filmmaker Joel Gilbert, features the 30-year-old Williams recounting memories from his childhood which prompted the search for his father. 
Arguing the channel had 'absolutely zero violations of any kind,' Gilbert places blame for the suspension squarely at Google and the Clinton campaign's feet. 
'It's obvious to me that the fix is in!' Gilbert wrote in a statement. 'The only possible explanation is that the Clinton campaign requested YouTube/Google to silence Danny, 'to run him off the plantation' as Danny said Hillary Clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the Arkansas Governor's mansion in 1990.' 
Youtube later restored Williams' channel early Thursday morning claiming a review confirmed it was not in violation of its Terms of Service. 
Last week, Danney went to Las Vegas – the site of the third US presidential debate – where he held a press conference alongside his lawyers announcing his intention to seek a DNA sample from Bill Clinton in order to settle the paternity dispute. 
Danney and his lawyers claim a previous DNA test carried out by the tabloid Star Magazine failed to obtain a blood sample from Clinton, an assertion confirmed by one of Star's former editors to World Net Daily . 
'I don't remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on Clinton's DNA,' former Star Magazine editor Phil Bunton stated to WND.

Store UK Economy Grows 0.5% in Three Months after Brexit Vote The GDP figure is driven by growth in the services sector - offsetting slides in construction, manufacturing and agriculture. Image Credits: publicdomainpictures.net . 
The UK economy grew by 0.5% in the three months after the Brexit vote, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said. 
The figure for July to September was down from the 0.7% growth recorded in the second quarter of 2016 – the months before Britain voted to leave the European Union. 
But it is more robust than many economists had expected – and stronger than the 0.2% forecast last month by the Bank of England (BoE). 
The higher-than-expected GDP figure was driven by the services sector – which accounts for more than 78% of the UK economy – which grew by 0.2% in the three months to September.

Christians Martyred by ISIS: 1,131 In addition, at least 125 Christian churches had been attacked or destroyed by ISIS Michael W. Chapman | CNS News - October 27, 2016 Comments 
A report submitted to the State Department earlier this year documented that between 2003 and June 9, 2014, at least 1,131 Christians – identified by name and place of death – had been murdered by the radical Muslims that comprise the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. 
In addition, at least 125 Christian churches had been attacked or destroyed by ISIS. 
The report, Genocide Against Christians in the Middle East , was submitted to Secretary of State John Kerry on March 9, 2016 by the Knights of Columbus and the humanitarian group In Defense of Christians. Eight days later, March 17, Kerry officially declared that ISIS's ongoing actions against Christians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities constituted genocide. 
Britain, the European Parliament, the U.N.'s High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the Iraqi and Kurdish governments have also declared ISIS's actions genocide.

Most Top Retailers Sell Food Produced With Bee-Killing Pesticides Only Aldi, Costco, and Whole Foods got passing grades Julie Fidler | Infowars.com - October 27, 2016 Comments 
A new 'scorecard' report gives a failing grade to 17 out of 20 major food retailers in the United States, based on their policies and practices regarding pollinator protection, organic options, and pesticide reduction. [1] Source: Friends of the Earth 
Tiffany Finck-Haynes, food futures campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said: 
'U.S. food retailers must take responsibility for how the products they sell are contributing to the bee crisis. 
The majority of the food sold at top U.S. food retailers is produced with pollinator-toxic pesticides. We urge all major retailers to work with their suppliers to eliminate pollinator-toxic pesticides and to expand domestic organic offerings that protect pollinators, people and the planet.' [1] Organic Offerings And Transparency Are Lacking 
The report 'Swarming the Aisles: Rating Top Retailers on Bee-Friendly and Organic Food' is the work of a coalition led by Friends of the Earth and more than 50 farmer, beekeeper, farmworker, environmental, and public interest organizations. [1] 
The coalition sent a letter urging food retailers to eliminate pesticides that are toxic to bees and other pollinators , and increase U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) certified organic food and beverages to 15% of overall offerings by 2025. The group would like to see retailers prioritize domestic, regional, and local p­roducers. 
Friends of the Earth and its allies have been successful in the past at convincing more than 65 garden retailers, including Lowe's and Home Depot, to commit to eliminate pollinator-toxic neonicotinoid (neonic) pesticides. 
According to Haynes, the demand for organic foods has grown by double-digits , but grocers aren't keeping up. She said: 
'A lot of the major food retailers have started to increase their organic offerings, but few of them have really adopted clear goals or metrics to continue to significantly increase their organic food offerings in the future.' [2] 
As evidenced by the group's research, it's difficult for the public to know where retailers stand concerning pesticide use and organic food. Eleven of the 20 retailers' websites examined by Friends of the Earth don't provide basic information concerning their policies on organic food, pollinators, and/or pesticides , Haynes said, adding: 
'There's a lot that retailers could do by adopting creative programs with their supply chain to help farmers grow their organic offerings, and then be able to sell that in their stores.' Americans Are Ready For Change 
A YouGov poll released 25 October 2016 by Friends of the Earth and SumOfUs reveals that 80% of Americans believe neonics should not be used in agriculture , and 65% of those who do the grocery shopping for their household would be more likely to shop at a store that has made a formal commitment to eliminate neonicotinoids. [1] 
Additionally, the poll shows that 59% of respondents believe it's important for supermarkets to sell organic food. Another 43% said they'd likely spend more time at a different grocery store if it sold more organic food than the store they currently frequent. 
Said Angus Wong, lead campaign strategist at SumOfUs, a consumer watchdog with ten million members: 
'Over 750,000 SumOfUs members have spoken out advocating that U.S. Hardware stores take action to protect our pollinators. And after years of pressure, Home Depot and Lowe's have finally enacted more bee-friendly policies. 
And the findings of this poll show that a vast majority of consumers want to eliminate neonicotinoids from their grocery stores too. This is why food retailers must commit policies that protect our bees immediately.' 
Only four of the nation's top food retailers – Albertsons, Costco, Target, and Whole Foods – have adopted and made public a company-wide commitment to increase offerings of certified organic food . They are also the only retailers to disclose data on the current percentage of organic food they offer, or organic sales. 
Aldi, Food Lion, part of the Delhaize Group, and Kroger disclosed data on the current percentage of organic offerings or organic sales. 
None of the retailers that the group looked at have publicly committed to sourcing organic food from American farmers . Retailer Apathy Is Killing Pollinators 
Of the top 20 food retailers surveyed by Friends of the Earth, a shocking 16 were predominantly unresponsive to Friends of the Earth's requests for information via surveys, calls, and letters. The group was forced to turn to publicly available information, including company websites, company annual reports, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports, press coverage, and industry analyses, for their data. 
We have bees to thank for every 1 in 3 bites of food we take ; and without bees, stores would run low on everything from strawberries to almonds. Source: Bee Cause 
Science increasingly points to neonicotinoid pesticides as a leading cause of pollinator decline. Glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsanto's blockbuster herbicide, Roundup, has been shown to play a significant role in monarch butterfly declines . 
Several U.S. cities have banned neonics, including Boulder City, Colorado , and Portland, Oregon . This past spring, Maryland became the first state to ban the pesticides .

Store When CIA and NSA Workers Blow the Whistle, Congress Plays Deaf It's pretty clear that those intelligence agencies — not the elected representatives of the people — are running the show in Washington Patrick G. Eddington | The Intercept - October 27, 2016 Comments 
DO THE COMMITTEES that oversee the vast U.S. spying apparatus take intelligence community whistleblowers seriously? Do they earnestly investigate reports of waste, fraud, abuse, professional negligence, or crimes against the Constitution reported by employees or contractors working for agencies like the CIA or NSA? For the last 20 years, the answer has been a resounding 'no.' 
My own experience in 1995-96 is illustrative. Over a two-year period working with my wife, Robin (who was a CIA detailee to a Senate committee at the time), we discovered that, contrary to the public statements by then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin Powell and other senior George H. W. Bush administration officials (including CIA Director John Deutch), American troops had in fact been exposed to chemical agents during and after the 1991 war with Saddam Hussein. While the Senate Banking Committee under then-Chairman Don Riegle, D-Mich., was trying to uncover the truth of this, officials at the Pentagon and CIA were working to bury it. 
At the CIA, I objected internally — and was immediately placed under investigation by the CIA's Office of Security. That became clear just days after we delivered the first of our several internal briefings to increasingly senior officials at the CIA and other intelligence agencies. In February 1995, I received a phone call from CIA Security asking whether I'd had any contacts with the media. I had not, but I had mentioned to CIA officials we'd met with that I knew that the CBS newsmagazine '60 Minutes' was working on a piece about the Gulf War chemical cover-up. This call would not be the last I'd receive from CIA Security about the matter, nor the only action the agency would take against us. 
In the spring of 1995, a former manager of Robin's discreetly pulled her aside and said that CIA Security agents were asking questions about us, talking to every single person with or for whom either of us had worked. I seemed to be the special focus of their attention, and the last question they asked our friends, colleagues, and former managers was, 'Do you believe Pat Eddington would allow his conscience to override the secrecy agreement he signed?'

Why Every Man Must Take Control Of His Finances How to profit off of the collapse Image Credits: flickr, 68751915@N05 . 
The world that we live in is nothing like the world that our parents lived in. Back in the pre-globalization era, of roughly 1940-1990, it was completely feasible to expect a corporation to pay your salary and help ease you into retirement. 
Back in this 'golden era,' corporations actually looked out for their employees. Through various financial means, such as the Roth 401k or a conventional pension, employers could expect to be getting a reliable deposit bi-monthly in order to help them sustain their standard of living all throughout their retirement years. 
It also used to be that a college degree was something to aspire to; something that guaranteed you a well-paying job, that would allow you to support a family of four with just a single college graduate's income. This is obviously no longer the case. 
Now, in 2016, the rate of unemployment for college graduates is officially 7%, but we all know the games that the economists play.

A Vote For Hillary is a Vote For World War 3 Do you stand "with her" nuclear holocaust? Paul Joseph Watson - October 28, 2016 Comments 
Do you stand 'with her' nuclear holocaust? 
Hillary Clinton has vowed to use military assets against Russia if Moscow is merely suspected of having engaged in a cyber attack. 
Hillary Clinton has already proven that she is a sociopathic warmonger. Her bloodthirsty zeal to overthrow Gaddafi in Libya directly led to the rise of ISIS, the international migrant crisis and a wrecked continent. 
If she is elected, Hillary will push for arming jihadist rebels in Syria with even more sophisticated weaponry and a no fly zone over the country – an effective declaration of war on the Syrian government and its ally, Russia.

Hillary Clinton is George W. Bush 2.0 – that's why she is supported by a plethora of 'Never Trump' neo-cons who are salivating over the prospect of getting back into power and launching new wars of aggression. 
Except this time the enemy won't be Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi or any other third world nation with a flimsy, virtually non-existent army. 
The enemy will be Russia – a country with a 3 million man army and a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons. 
It is important to not fall prey to normalcy bias. Just because there hasn't been a major conflict in most our our lifetimes doesn't mean it can't happen. The history of humanity is the history of warfare.

Statistical Tie: Latest Breitbart/Gravis Poll Shows Donald Trump Closes the Gap with Less Than Two Weeks Left Clinton, at 46 percent, leads Trump at 45 percent by just one point Breitbart - October 28, 2016 Comments 
NEW YORK CITY, New York — Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has closed the gap with his Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton with just a couple weeks left in the election, the latest national Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing poll shows. 
Clinton, at 46 percent, leads Trump at 45 percent by just one point—inside the survey's 2.3 percent margin of error. Libertarian Gary Johnson gets just 3 percent and the Green Party's Dr. Jill Stein just 1 percent, while 4 percent are unsure. The survey was conducted from Oct. 25 to Oct. 26, sampling 1,824 registered voters across the United States. The poll was conducted using a combination of interactive voice response polling and an internet panel of cell phone users. 
'Something has happened since the third debate,' Doug Kaplan, the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, said of the poll. 'Conventional wisdom was after Trump said he wouldn't promise to accept the results of the election and made the 'nasty woman' comment, many thought Hillary would gain—but Trump seems to be closing the gap. In every election in the last 30 years, this happens where the person behind closes the gap. Hillary still has a clear electoral advantage and many paths to victory. However, Trump is not out of it but Hillary is still the favorite.' 
'This is a big story because it shows Trump really closing, importantly, as the other close polls are showing,' Democratic pollster Pat Caddell, who worked for President Jimmy Carter and is working with Breitbart News and Gravis Marketing on these polls, added. 'He is closing with his favorability and unfavorability as well. 
Caddell said he thinks Obamacare's failures, where premiums are skyrocketing, is one of many reasons why Trump is surging. 'Among other things, that is contributing [to Trump's rise in the polls],' Caddell said. 'When we are looking down the road at other things that may be influential, we are seeing the possibility of again on the immigration issue—that thing about concern on the border seems to be increasing as is opposition to Hillary and their plans to expand immigration and refugees, which is another big issue. But more importantly, at the end of the survey, we see both candidates have problems on their ability to unite the country and on whether or not they can have the moral leadership to lead. They're basically about the same, which I consider a real improvement for Trump now that he's that close.'

Schools All Over America Are Closing On Election Day Due To Fears Of Violence All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything Image Credits: flickr, cali4beach . 
Will this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? 
All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , 'voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere.' Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. 
Many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News … 
Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. 
The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. 
'If anybody can sit there and say they don't think this is a contentious election, then they aren't paying much attention,' Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. 
And without a doubt, voting locations are 'soft targets' that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters … 
'There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didn't have 15 or 20 years ago,' said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. ' What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then that's certainly concerning.' 
All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. 
Let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. 
Another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania … 
'We don't want to lose an election because you know what I'm talking about,' Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. 'Because you know what? That's a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places .' 
And of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats… 
Early voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. 
Republican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. 
'I tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent,' Moynihan said. 'You could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat.' 
In addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . 
Well, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation … 
According to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. 
The McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation – apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007 – when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? 
Either way, it doesn't look good. 
After everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. 
But Democrats don't like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters… 
'It's un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that ,' Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book ' Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America ,' previously told The Christian Science Monitor. 'Voting was very, very dangerous. I don't think anyone's suggesting that we're at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic.' 
Without a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. 
But will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? 
If that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew. Related Articles

Putin Mocks Clinton Claim Of Russia Election Meddling: 'Is U.S. A Banana Republic?' 'Is the U.S. a banana republic? America is a great power. If I'm wrong, correct me.' American Mirror - October 28, 2016 Comments 
Hillary Clinton claims she's the only candidate who will stand up to Vladimir Putin, but she's also the only candidate who apparently believes the United States is vulnerable enough to not prevent Russia from meddling in the November presidential election. 
Russian President Putin mocked that notion on Thursday. Vladimir Putin: "Does anyone really think Russia could influence the American people's choice in any way? What,is the US a banana republic?" pic.twitter.com/ngQhJR1AtP 
'Does anyone seriously think that Russia can influence the choice of the American people?' Putin told a group of academics in Sochi. 
'Is the U.S. a banana republic? America is a great power. If I'm wrong, correct me.' 
Hillary Clinton has repeatedly blamed Russia for the disclosures of campaign operative emails by Wikileaks. 
'We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election,' Clinton said at the second presidential debate. 
'And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected. They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.' 
'Anything that goes wrong they blame Russia,' Trump told a crowd in Ocala, Florida days later. 'We are being hacked because we have people who don't know what they are doing. They always blame Russia.'

WATCH: CNN Called 'Clinton News Network' On Air by Fiery British Conservative The implosion that followed is something to see Image Credits: Wiki Commons . 
CNN anchor Hala Gorani wasn't expecting her network to be called the 'Clinton News Network' by British firebrand conservative columnist Katie Hopkins from The Daily Mail and watching the ensuing implosion is a must-see. 
Hopkins' first offense was daring to believe Donald Trump is going to win the election — never a good way to start on CNN: 
'I think he's going to win. I think you guys are in for a big surprise, which I'm quite excited about. I think we've seen a very similar think here in the UK with Brexit. We saw a lot of the liberal press, kind of, sneering at Brexiteers. We saw a lot of the sneering that we see from the Clinton News Network.' 
'That's CNN. You're calling us the Clinton News Network?' Gorani said in shock. 
'You're exactly correct,' Hopkins said. 
The two argued over how the media are obsessed with polls, especially the ones showing Hillary Clinton in the lead. Hopkins destroyed Gorani saying, 'Having sat in the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and watched your news network, it is entirely biased, I think, in coverage.' 
Gorani refused to believe and said over her 18-year career at CNN, she's only seen 'nothing but balance' at the network. 
Oddly enough, as the sparring match continued, Gorani repeatedly cut Hopkins off when she criticized the Clintons.

Germany: Students Forced to Chant 'Allahu Akbar,' Punished for Refusing Trip to Mosque Intolerance will not be tolerated! Chris Menahan | Information Liberation - October 28, 2016 Comments 
Islamic indoctrination is now mandatory in German schools. 
From The Daily Express : 
PUPILS at a primary school were forced to chant 'Allahu Akhbar' and 'there is no God but Allah', an appalled father has claimed. 
The father of the pupil at the girl's primary school in German ski resort Garmisch-Partenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the Islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given. 
He claimed she had been 'forced' by teachers to memorise the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24. 
The handout read: 'Oh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you.' 
It had been given to the girl during a lesson in 'ethics' at the Bavarian school. 
What are they going to teach, the ethics of conquest and slavery? 
Here's another story from yesterday in RT : 
Parents of a German teenager may face a trial and fine for 'truancy' after refusing to allow their son to go to a local mosque on a school field trip out of fear that it would lead to his 'indoctrination' by Islamic radicals. 
The story broke in mid-June, when parents of a 13-year-old student opposed the idea of their son visiting a mosque in the northern German town of Rendsburg, reportedly organized as part of a geography class. 
In a letter to the class teacher quoted by the NDR, the teen's father argued that his son would be 'indoctrinated' in the mosque. He went on to say that 'for years we have been hearing reports about religiously-motivated violence connected with Islamic people.' 
A local education authority subsequently fined the couple a total of €300 ($328), referring to school regulations and regional laws which include penalties for truancy. 
— Alexandra Witt (@AlexiaStellar) October 23, 2016 
When the parents opposed the fine, their case was forwarded to Peter Mueller-Rakow, a local prosecutor, who will decide whether or not to proceed with a court trial, Spiegel reported on Wednesday. 
The parents' lawyer, Alexander Heumann, argues that they refused the school trip out of fear for their son's 'bodily safety.' 
Denying any faith-based motives, he emphasized that the couple do not belong to any religious group, and are of the opinion that 'nobody shall be forced into a sacred place against his good will.' 
…School principal Renate Fritzsche … told NDR that the field trip to the mosque was meant to promote tolerance and diversity. 
'We also have Muslim children with us and Muslim parents also know that there are no exceptions,' she said, adding that swimming lessons and sex education are compulsory for Muslim children as well. 'It is not the responsibility of the parents to say: 'My child will attend such or such class,'' Fritzsche asserted. 
Intolerance will not be tolerated!

Wikileaks Email: Hillary Campaign Struggles to Reach 'F**king Dumb' Young People "That's the crap that young people pay attention to" Paul Joseph Watson - October 28, 2016 Comments A new email released by Wikileaks as part of the Podesta dump features Hillary ally Wendy Bronfein advising Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta on how to reach 'f**king dumb' young people. Marketing executive Bronfein tells Podesta that Clinton 'may not be the best face' to attract younger voters and that she needs to utilize 'trending figures' as par of an 'infusion to pull younger voters' because 'that's the crap that young people pay attention to'. Bronfein goes on to state, 'It's f**king dumb but being 'cool' counts for more than it maybe should.' She references Bill Clinton's saxophone playing as an example of this before asserting, 'I hate to generalize a generation but by social media nature, they 'follow'. So if someone they identify as cool endorses – they will likely fall in line with that candidate.' Bronfein is introduced to John Podesta in another email as someone who 'could be immensely helpful in improving HRC's connection to millennials.' The email is yet another example of the disdain that Hillary insiders have for Clinton's own voters. Yesterday, we highlighted how Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accused Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being 'stupid'. In an audio recording leaked earlier this month, Hillary Clinton was caught on tape saying Bernie Sanders supporters are 'living in their parents' basement' and had bought into a 'false promise'. In another email , Clinton operative Bill Ivey spoke of the need to maintain political power by producing 'an unaware and compliant citizenry'.

Maryland Trump Supporter: They Switched My Vote to Hillary Yet another report of vote flipping 
A woman in Hollywood, Maryland is the latest in a number of early voters to claim that her ballot was switched to Hillary Clinton after she had tried to vote for Donald Trump. Maryland Trump Supporter: They Switched My Vote to Hillary – https://t.co/FkNiEUOZHH pic.twitter.com/dalY9KBWtj 
— Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) October 28, 2016 Noting that she had seen reports on the news of votes being flipped, the woman said, 'I went in and voted a straight Republican ticket and thank God I went back and checked and they had switched my vote from Trump to (Hillary).' She said that she had to get the vote changed back by alerting election officials, who simply told her to vote for a second time. 'I went back the second time and made sure they didn't change it,' she concluded. As we reported earlier this week, voters in numerous areas of Texas have made a series of complaints that votes are being switched from Trump to Clinton. One election official responded by claiming the problems were caused by voters not understanding how to use the machines properly. 'Typically, we've found it's voter error with the equipment,' Frank Phillips, Tarrant County's election administrator, told WFAA . 'Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates … or do something with the wheel….There is not an issue with the equipment.' However, Trump supporters continue to point to the reports as evidence that vote fraud may be taking place.

Clinton Insider: Rigging Only Way Hillary Can Win She's going to lose and she knows it, he said Jamie White | Infowars.com - October 28, 2016 Comments 
Hillary Clinton and the Democrats have begun stealing the election using every underhanded tactic because it's the only way she can win, says Clinton insider Larry Nichols. 
'She's going to lose and she knows it,' Nichols said on The Alex Jones Show Thursday. 'Unless she can amass and pull off the biggest amount of voter fraud in the history of this country.' 
Nichols explained that the establishment is already doing what it can to prevent an open and transparent election. 
'The DNC filed a lawsuit to try to force the removal of poll watchers at the polls,' he said. 'Why would they do that if they know there's no cheating going on? Why would they fight the voter ID if they don't plan to have massive voter fraud?' 
The mainstream media and the Clinton campaign are also doing everything they can up until Election Day to make everybody believe that the election is already over in Hillary's favor, Nichols said. 
'Folks, do not believe it,' he said. 'The polling is a part of this game plan to destroy your confidence in your ability to win.' 
'I believe Donald Trump is winning,' Nichols added. 'You're winning. You've just got to stay the course.' 
Nichols warned that voters must take extra steps to ensure their vote isn't being altered. 
'You've got to make people at the precinct prove that your vote was recorded properly,' he said. 'If they can't show you proof, then demand a paper ballot.' 
The damning videos provided by Project Veritas exposing high-level Democrat operatives discussing how they steal elections illustrate that worries about voter fraud aren't unfounded, with even the New York Times acknowledging a recent survey showing that most voters fear their ballot won't count because they believe 'the political process is so dominated by corporate interests.'

Social Media Activity Can Show Early Signs of Depression and Schizophrenia What you "like" and share could be strong indicators of a mental illness Image Credits: Simon/Pixabay . 
What you post and 'like' on Facebook could reveal whether you're showing the early signs of depression and schizophrenia, experts say. 
Researchers from Cambridge and Stanford universities believe that studying how people behave on the social network could be more effective than studying their real-life behaviour . 
That's because people – especially teenagers – share way more emotional indicators than they would do offline.

Big Pharma Targets Profits in Rare Diseases All of the world's most expensive drugs are used to treat uncommon conditions Image Credits: StockSnap/Pixabay . 
One might think Big Pharma garners most of its profit peddling pills for more well-known diseases, but new research shows that pharmaceutical companies are instead searching for the next 'big thing' in rare diseases. 
Big Pharma's profit margins continue to rise considerably with rarer diseases, simply because they can charge more for the pills than they do for medication for more common ailments. 
The search for the next money-maker within rare diseases has actually halted some of the advancements for more common ailments, which may explain why they still haven't discovered a cure for some of the most common diseases affecting the world's population. 
In 1983, the Orphan Drug Act started to incentivize the creation of drugs for rarer diseases to ensure that those suffering from uncommon conditions were not neglected in new scientific research simply because the drugs weren't as profitable. 
Because of the incentives, which include reduced taxes and reduced or waived regulatory fees, over 500 new drugs for uncommon diseases have hit the market since the law was introduced. 
For common illnesses, Big Pharma can get still turnover big profits while not charging a fortune for the drug. For example, Liptior (atorvastatin), which is used to regulate cholesterol, generates a sales profit of $131 billion with the prescription only costing patients around $2 per day. 
But with rare diseases, prices must be kept high in order to keep Big Pharma in business. This means that while those with uncommon illnesses may benefit healthwise from the new measures, their pocketbooks are in for a hit. 
For example, the cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco by Vertex costs individual patients $311,000. 
Gilead's Sovaldi, used to treat Hepatitis C, cashes in at $84,000 for a paltry 12-week course of medication. 
And Soliris, used to treat rare blood conditions, costs the patient a whopping $400,000 per year. 
The list of the 10 most expensive drugs that are currently manufactured are all created to treat 'orphan' or uncommon illnesses. 
Thanks to these laws that allow Big Pharma to charge these insane amounts of money, they can use those who suffer from rare diseases as their cash cows. 
Drugs for rare diseases will account for 19% of pharmaceutical branded drug profits by the year 2020. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew. Related Articles

Breaking: FBI Reopens Investigation into Clinton Emails FBI looking into "new developments" after previously recommending no charges against Democrat candidate Image Credits: Gage Skidmore / Flickr . 
The FBI on Friday announced it is reopening their investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server, another shocking October surprise for the Democrat candidate days from the presidential election. 
In a letter to committees and lawmakers relevant to the matter, FBI Director James Comey cited 'recent developments' for the bureau's decision to look into new emails which may contain classified information and how they may relate to its previous investigation. 
'In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton's personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony,' Comey wrote in the letter obtained by CNBC . 
'In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.' 
'Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be signifcant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony,' Comey stated. 
Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz, who led an Oversight Committee effort to pursue perjury charges against Hillary , tweeted about the FBI's announcement. FBI Dir just informed me, "The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation." Case reopened 
— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 
Back in July, Comey announced the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state would not result in a recommendation to the Justice Department to pursue charges. 
'Although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,' the FBI director stated in a speech at the time. Trump: I have great respect that the FBI and Department of Justice have the courage to right their horrible mistake pic.twitter.com/LeDNgWvqa2 
— Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) October 28, 2016 
Speaking at a campaign rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump jumped on the bureau's decision to reopen its case: 
'The FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new emails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's investigation. And they are reopening their case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America.' 
'Hillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.' 
'I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Dept. of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made. This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood and it is everybody's hope that it is about to be corrected.' 
CNBC reports, 'Stocks turned negative after the report of the new probe,' adding that 'Many analysts have said that markets were pricing in a Clinton victory in November.'

Is De-industrialization a 'Natural Phenomenon' of Developed Economies? Increasing real revenues affect people's lifestyle choices Jörg Guido Hülsmann | Mises.org   
Let me first state my position and then add a few arguments to back it up. 
Economic growth typically entails a re-allocation of labor away from industrial production, but it does not all by itself lead to falling industrial output. The decline of industrial production in the US and France in the past thirty years is to some extent due to capital exports, but especially to government interventionism in the form of mushrooming labor, business and financial regulations, education policies, social security funding, and taxation. This decline cannot be stopped through more interventions, even if they are designed with the good intention to reindustrialize the country. 
Now let me offer a few considerations in support of these contentions. 
The reallocation of labor in a growing economy results most notably from capital accumulation and from changing preferences of the working-age population. Further investments and extensions of the existing structure of production make it necessary to spend more time devising new methods, preparing industrial activity, coordinating and monitoring supply chains. Low-quality blue-collar labor diminishes, whereas there is some increase in high-quality blue-collars, but especially an increase in white-collars working in and around the supply chains. 
Increasing real revenues affect people's lifestyle choices. Rather than laboring long hours that provide essentially a monetary reward, they increasingly prefer enjoyable activities that provide immediate psychological and emotional rewards. Thus the blossoming of artistic, intellectual, and scientific activities in developed countries, at the expense of traditional industrial pursuits. 
As a natural consequence of economic growth, therefore, industrial production declines relative to what it could be if it attracted even more people. But this does neither imply a shrinking physical industrial output, nor does it imply shrinking industrial revenues. Capital accumulation and technological progress make it possible that industry thrives even when less people have industrial employment. Germany provides an example. 
In the past thirty years, western capitalists have invested large amounts of capital in formerly communist countries of the East and Far East. This reallocation of capital, though beneficial from the overall point of view of the world economy, has been detrimental in the short-run to the industrial development of those western countries where the capital would otherwise have been used. 
But capital investments in countries such as France and the US have declined even more as a result of mushrooming government interventions. Welfare checks diminish the incentive to accept low-paying and non-gratifying industrial jobs. Massive subsidies for secondary and higher education artificially prolong schooling; reduce the supply of qualified manual labor; and create an artificial bias among the working-age population for scientific, intellectual, and artistic activities. Panoply of regulations have, on the one hand, increased the costs of doing business and, on the other hand, stimulated rent-seeking and manifold forms of evasion and regulatory arbitrage. Today they are feeding entire armies of lawyers, accountants, auditors, and financial advisors, all at the expense of ordinary business. 
These tendencies cannot be stopped through so-called reindustrialization policies, which boil down to even more government spending, premised on the spurious notion that irresponsible (and often also inexperienced) politicians know best how to use the available scarce resources. Such policies have utterly failed in the past (Airbus included), and will fail in the future. Genuine reindustrialization requires more oxygen for industry. It requires nothing less than a rollback of the artificial obstacles for industrial development that government interventions have created in past generations.

The Email That Got John Podesta Hacked Latest WikiLeaks dump reveals phishing email that compromised Podesta Mikael Thalen - October 28, 2016 Comments 
The email that lead to the hack of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's Gmail account was published online Friday by WikiLeaks. 
The malicious March 2016 email, which claims to be from Google, asked Podesta to change his password due to unauthorized access from an IP address in the Ukraine. 
Clinton campaign staff members who viewed the email were convinced it was genuine. Clinton insider Sara Latham argued 'The gmail one is REAL' while even Clinton campaign IT specialist Charles Delavan said 'This is a legitimate email.' 
The first suspicious aspect of the email, unnoticed by the Clinton camp, was the 'bit.ly' password reset link. Bitly, a website that shortens long web addresses, would not be found in an official email from Google. 
As first reported by Motherboard earlier this month, examination of the Bitly link that redirected Podesta to a fake Google webpage also contained several red flags. 
The Bitly link helped hide not only the fact that the landing page ended in '.tk' instead of '.com' but that the web page itself failed to use HTTPS encryption. Such links were also likely used to fool Google's spam filters. 
Prior analysis of the phishing link by cybersecurity group SecureWorks revealed the hackers also made a significant operation security mistake – they failed to make their two Bitly accounts private. 
The public accounts revealed the hackers had created 8,909 similar links to use against 3,907 Gmail accounts between October 2015 and May 2016. 
SecureWorks notes that the targets included 'individuals in Russia and the former Soviet states, current and former military and government personnel in the U.S. and Europe, individuals working in the defense and government supply chain, and authors and journalists.' 
Accounts linked to the 2016 election were also in the hackers' sights. 
'Specific targets include staff working for or associated with Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), including individuals managing Clinton's communications, travel, campaign finances, and advising her on policy.' 
Thomas Rid, a professor at King's college, displayed on Twitter how decoding the phishing links could reveal the specific emails being targeted. 
Click to enlarge Interestingly, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, whose emails were released by the website DCLeaks in September, was also targeted by the same hackers. 
Click to enlarge This connection suggests the hackers who provided WikiLeaks with the Podesta emails and DCLeaks with the Powell emails are likely one in the same. The Bitly accounts are also behind the malicious email sent to retired four-star General Philip Mark Breedlove – whose emails appeared on DCLeaks in April. 
Numerous cybersecurity groups have accused the Russian government of being responsible not only for the above election season hacks but for creating DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0. to disseminate the data. The U.S. government also publicly blamed Russia on October 7 just one week before the CIA was tasked with preparing a possible retaliatory ' cyber strike .' 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied involvement, arguing that the contents of the hacks are far more important than who is responsible. 
'Listen, does it even matter who hacked this data?'' Putin said on September 1. 'The important thing is the content that was given to the public.'' 
Putin again dismissed US 'hysteria' concerning the hacks on Thursday during an annual speech at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi. 
'Hysteria has been whipped up in the United States about the influence of Russia over the U.S. presidential election,' he said. 'It's much simpler to distract people with so-called Russian hackers, spies, and agents of influence. Does anyone really think that Russia could influence the American people's choice in any way? Is America a banana republic or what? America is a great power.' NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew. Related Articles

Britain Should Embrace Unilateral Free Trade Right Now Unilateralism is not simply a utopian libertarian ideal Louis Rouanet | Mises.org   Image Credits: Iker Merodio / Flickr . 
If we read the newspapers or listen to the experts, Britain faces two ways to negotiate its way out of the European Union without succumbing to the protectionists' sirens. 
The first is a deal à la Norway not only with full access to the common market, but also with full implementation of EU law and a contribution to the EU budget as is the case for every member State. The second option would be a trade treaty such as the one negotiated between the EU and Canada. However, a viable third opportunity exists: unilateral free-trade. 
Contrary to what is often assumed, unilateralism is not simply a utopian libertarian ideal which cannot be reached in today's world. Unilateral free trade is genuine free-trade. It is also the most pragmatic and efficient strategy to foster commerce and peace. Theresa May seems ready to conduct an interventionist industrial and economic policy which oddly resembles French planning as it existed in the 50s and 60s. But, the free-market policy paradigm is more likely to transform post-Brexit Britain into a flourishing economy. 
Unilateral Free Trade: The British Tradition 
The tradition of unilateral free trade is tightly linked to the UK. With the victory of the liberals in the 1840s, Britain became strongly committed to unilateral free trade and from 1845 to at least 1914, free trade was politically unassailable. Trade treaties, however, were seen as inherently suspicious. Sir Robert Peel, when announcing the repeal of the Corn Laws in the House of Commons in 1846, brilliantly warned: 
I trust the government … will not resume the policy which they and we have found most inconvenient, namely the haggling with foreign countries about reciprocal concessions, instead of taking that independent course which we believe to be conducive to our own interests. … [L]et us trust that our example, with the proof of practical benefits we derive from it, will at no remote period insure the adoption of the principles on which we have acted. … Let, therefore, our commerce be as free as our institutions. Let us proclaim commerce free, and nation after nation will follow our example. This repeal of the Corn Laws was the result of an intense political effort, especially by Cobden and the Anti-Corn Law League, who made the case for unilateral free trade. Cobden in his later years explained: 
We came to the conclusion that the less we attempted to persuade foreigners to adopt our trade principles, the better, for we discovered so much suspicion of the motives of England, that it was lending an argument to the protectionists abroad to incite the popular feeling against the free-traders. … To take away this pretense, we avowed our total indifference whether other nations became free-traders or not; but we should abolish Protection for our own selves, and leave other countries to take whatever course they liked best. Some will argue that the UK soon departed from unilateral free trade with the Cobden-Chevalier treaty of 1860 which Cobden himself supported and negotiated. It is less known however that this treaty was primarily a way to avoid conflict. After Orsini's attempt to murder Napoléon III in 1858, the emperor was convinced, by this same Orsini, to support the cause of Italian independence. This Italian question brought England to the edge of war with France. Being strongly anti-militarists, both Cobden and Chevalier looked at a trade treaty not primarily as a way to adopt free trade, but as a way to establish friendship between France and England. Gladstone, himself an ardent unilateralist, in retrospect held that 'there were only two alternatives, one of them the French treaty & the other war with France.' And Cobden felt that the treaty was 'God's own method to produce an entente cordiale.' 
Commercially, the treaty was an incredible success mainly because it was not supervised by bureaucrats — as is the case today with trade treaties — but by two prominent free traders. As Cobden was aware of all the dangers for real free trade contained in the negotiations of trade treaties, he proceeded very carefully. Cobden wrote in a letter to the great British free trader John Bright, 'I will undertake that there is not a syllable on our side of the Treaty that is inconsistent with the soundest principles of Free Trade.' Nonetheless, Bright remained a skeptic and remarked: 
Governments seem as a rule to be standing conspiracies to rob and bamboozle people, and why should that of Louis Napoleon be an exception? The more I see of the rulers of the world, the less of wisdom or greatness do I find necessary for the government of mankind. To convince Cobden of the benefits brought about by a treaty, Michel Chevalier showed that the unilateral reductions of tariffs that Bright asked for could constitute the British side of the bargain and could be extended to all other nations, thus avoiding a clear violation of British unilateralism. 
Free Trade With or Without You 
The unilateral free trade program is very simple: the British Parliament declares the abolition of all tariffs. To avoid a race in non-tariff barriers, the Parliament can pass a law declaring that every product which conforms to the EU norms and regulations can be sold freely in the UK. This should not be a problem since the UK still is a member of the EU. By Parliament's act, most of the 'non-tariff barrier' problem withers away without any need for regulatory harmonization. If the EU legislator considers it necessary to regulate the curvature of vegetables, so be it! But, although EU producers will be free to sell their product in the UK, the British legislator may deem it unnecessary to regulate its producers in the same absurd way. 
The advantages of this approach are many. First, the UK can have free trade now instead of waiting through years of negotiations. No need to wait for bureaucrats to agree on which laws we burden consumers and producers with. 
The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), for example, between the EU and Canada contrasts the expediency of unilateralism with endless negotiations. Negotiations about CETA were started in October 2008 and finished in August 2014. But for the treaty to be effective, each EU member State still has to ratify it. Worse, in some European federal member States, the treaty must be agreed upon by the local federated States. This is why Wallonia recently vetoed CETA, thus threatening the work of a six-year-long negotiation. In the case of the UK — and whether or not trade treaties are actually advancing free trade — the British economy cannot afford to wait that long for free trade. 
The second major advantage of unilateralism is the message you send to Brussels. You are signifying to the EU apparatus that 'with or without you, we will have free trade!' At this point, the EU will have no leverage left with the UK. The negotiation of a trade treaty, on the other hand is a hopelessly utopian solution, not only because of the obvious coordination problem between the 28 EU member States, but also because the EU has a vested interest in making sure Brexit fails. Eurocrats, starting from the contestable assumption that the UK has much more to lose than the EU, will try to concoct a deal as bad as possible for their fellow Anglo-Saxon neighbors. 
Free Trade First, Negotiations Later 
Still, it is possible that after having declared free trade unilaterally, the EU will decide to restrict the access of British corporations to the single market. This is a particularly valid concern in the financial sector were banks and other financial institutions need licenses to operate in the EU member States. The concern with unilateral free trade is that by respecting it, it will remove any leverage the British government has to negotiate a favorable access to other actual and potential commercial partners. Without a treaty, commercial partners, it is thought, will soon erect protectionist barriers. 
Unilateral free trade, however, does not mean the UK producers will be bullied without their government being able to respond. First, by declaring unilateral free trade, the maintained strength of commercial links made will make it much easier to negotiate with the EU. To antagonize a good client would be foolish. Let's not forget that this past decade, British exports to the EU grew much slower than exports to the rest of the world. At the same time, the UK is a major consumer of EU products and its balance of commerce with the EU was negative by about £62 billion in 2014. 
But how can a country committed to unilateralism make sure other countries will not close their markets? Let us first remark that maintaining trade barriers to negotiate later with other nations is a self-defeating strategy. Sir Robert Peel, whom we mentioned earlier, said in 1842 that in the case of wine and brandy he did not reduce the duty, because he hoped that they might employ these duties 'as instruments of negotiation, with a view of effecting a reduction in the duties imposed by other countries on the produce of our own country.' Such a strategy was self-defeating. Tariffs in view of a negotiation, by reducing the capacity of foreigners to produce for the British market, were destroying the very interests that wanted free trade. Peel finally admitted, in 1843, during a debate in the House of Commons, 'I am bound to say that it is our interest to buy cheap, whether other countries will buy cheap or no.' 
There certainly is a more efficient policy than maintaining trade barriers or threatening to raise some in order to force trade 'partners' to keep their markets open. Indeed, the British government can make it clear that if the EU unfairly penalizes British interests in some sectors, e.g., finance, then the British government will work to maintain the competitiveness of the industry in question by aggressively lowering their taxes. Imagine that the EU wants to damage Britain's car manufacturers. Then the British government should not be afraid to create a loophole and to lower manufacturers' corporate taxes — even to zero. In an economy which was never as globalized and competitive as today, the UK would have good chances of prevailing over the EU interests. 
Perhaps the EU will consider making trading conditions with the UK harder, but they would have way too much to lose if doing so means creating a fiscally ultra-attractive market just next door. In the short run, unilateralism in trade can achieve what multilateralism cannot, a quick and radical liberalization of exchanges. In the long run, unilateralism can achieve what multilateralism cannot, genuine free trade.

The following excerpt is adapted from Mendenhall's review of Deirdre McCloskey's book Bourgeois Equality; the original review, which appeared in the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics, is available here. 
If it's true that Wayne Booth inspired Deirdre McCloskey's interest in the study of rhetoric, then it's also true — happily, in my view — that McCloskey has refused to mimic Booth's programmatic, formulaic methods and boorish insistence on prosaic succinctness. Bourgeois Equality is McCloskey's third volume in a monumental trilogy that began with The Bourgeois Virtues (2006) and Bourgeois Dignity (2010), each published by the University of Chicago Press. This latest volume is a Big Book, alike in kind but not in theme to Jacques Barzun's From Dawn to Decadence (2000), Camille Paglia's Sexual Personae (1990), or Herald Berman's Law and Revolution (1983) and Law and Revolution II (2006). It's meandering and personal, blending scholarship with an essayistic style that recalls Montaigne or Emerson. 
McCloskey's elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice. At times humorous, rambling, and deliberately erratic, she gives the distinct impression that she's simply telling a story, one that happens to validate a thesis. She's having fun. Imagine Phillip Lopate articulating economic history. McCloskey is, in this regard, a latter-day Edward Gibbon, adopting a mode and persona that's currently unfashionable among mainstream historians, except that she's more lighthearted than Gibbon, and unashamedly optimistic. 
McCloskey's elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice. At times humorous, rambling, and deliberately erratic, she gives the distinct impression that she's simply telling a story, one that happens to validate a thesis. She's having fun. Imagine Phillip Lopate articulating economic history. McCloskey is, in this regard, a latter-day Edward Gibbon, adopting a mode and persona that's currently unfashionable among mainstream historians, except that she's more lighthearted than Gibbon, and unashamedly optimistic. 
Writing with an air of confidence, McCloskey submits, contra Thomas Piketty, that ideas and ideology — not capital accumulation or material resources — have caused widespread economic development. Since 1800, worldwide material wealth has increased and proliferated; the quality of life in poor countries has risen — even if it remains unequal to that of more prosperous countries —and the typical human being now enjoys access to the food, goods, services, medicine, and healthcare that, in earlier centuries, were available to only a select few in the richest parts of the globe. The transition from poverty to wealth was occasioned by shifting rhetoric that reflected an emerging ethical consensus. The rhetorical-ethical change involved people's 'attitudes toward other humans' (p. xxiii), namely, the recognition of shared experience and 'sympathy,' as Adam Smith stated in The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Attributing human progress to ideas enables McCloskey to advocate the norms and principles that facilitated economic growth and social improvement (e.g., class mobility and fluidity) while generating extensive prosperity. Thus, her project is at once scholarly and tendentious: a study of the conditions and principles that, in turn, she promotes. 
She argues that commercialism flourished in the eighteenth century under the influence of ideas — such as 'human equality of liberty in law and of dignity and esteem' (p. xxix) — that were packaged in memorable rhetoric and aesthetics. 'Not matter, mainly, but ideas' caused the Great Enrichment (p. 643). In other words, '[t]he original and sustaining causes of the modern world […] were ethical, not material,' and they included 'the new and liberal economic idea of liberty for ordinary people and the new and democratic social idea of dignity for them' (p. xxxi). This thesis about liberty and dignity is clear and unmistakable if only because it is repetitive. McCloskey has a habit of reminding readers—in case you missed her point the first, second, or fifty-seventh time around—that the causes of the Industrial Revolution and the Great Enrichment were ideas, not 'narrowly economic or political or legal changes' (p. 470). She maintains, to this end, that the Scottish Enlightenment succeeded in combining the concepts of liberty and dignity into a desirable form of equality—not equality of outcomes, of course, but of opportunity and treatment under the law. And the Scottish model, to her mind, stands in contradistinction to the French example of centralized, top-down codification, command, planning, and design. 
A perennial villain lurks in the pages of her history: the 'clerisy,' which is an 'appendage of the bourgeoisie' (p. 597) and often dubbed 'the elite' in regular parlance. McCloskey calls the clerisy 'the sons of bourgeois fathers' (p. xvii) and 'neo-aristocratic' (p. 440). The clerisy includes those 'artists, intellectuals, journalists, professionals, and bureaucrats' who resent 'the commercial and bettering bourgeoisie' (p. xvi). The clerisy seeks, in different ways at different times, to extinguish unfettered competition with exclusive, illiberal, irrevocable grants and privileges that are odious to free society and offensive to the rights of average consumers. 'Early on,' says McCloskey, referring to the period in Europe after the revolutionary year 1848, 'the clerisy began to declare that ordinary people are misled in trading, and so require expert protection and supervision' (p. 609). The clerisy since then has been characterized by paternalism and a sense of superiority. 
Because the clerisy is shape-shifting, assuming various forms from time to time and place to place, it's a tough concept to pin down. The word 'clerisy' does not appear in the book's index to permit further scrutiny. By contrast, McCloskey's general arguments are easy to follow because the book is separated into parts with questions as their titles; subparts consisting of onesentence headings answer those questions. 
In a massive tour de force such as this, readers are bound to take issue with certain interpretive claims. Historians will find McCloskey's summaries to be too breezy. Even libertarians will accuse her of overlooking manifest wrongs that occurred during the periods she surveys. My complaints are few but severe. For instance, McCloskey is, I believe, either careless or mistaken to announce that, during the nineteenth and early twentieth century, 'under the influence of a version of science,' in a territory that's never specifically identified, 'the right seized upon social Darwinism and eugenics to devalue the liberty and dignity of ordinary people, and to elevate the nation's mission above the mere individual person, recommending, for example, colonialism and compulsory sterilization and the cleansing power of war' (p. xviii). 
Let's hope that it's innocent negligence rather than willful distortion that underlies this odd, unqualified, categorical assertion. Adam Cohen's Imbeciles (2016) and Thomas C. Leonard's Illiberal Reformers (2016) describe how, in the United States, social Darwinism and eugenics were adopted primarily, though not exclusively, by the Left, not the Right. These recent books come on the heels of several scholarly treatments of this subject: Thomas M. Shapiro's Population Control Politics (1985), Philip R. Reilly's The Surgical Solution (1991), Joel Braslow's Mental Ills and Bodily Cures (1997), Wendy Kline's Building a Better Race (2001), Stefan Kuhl's The Nazi Connection (2002), Nancy Ordover's American Eugenics (2003), Christine Rosen's Preaching Eugenics (2004), Christina Cogdell's Eugenic Design (2004), Gregory Michael Dorr's Segregation's Science (2008), Paul A. Lombardo's edition A Century of Eugenics in America (2011), and Alexander Minna Stern's Eugenic Nation (2016). These represent only a small sampling. 
Is McCloskey unware of these texts? Probably not: she reviewed Leonard's book for Reason, although she did so after her own book reached press. At any rate, would she have us believe that Emma Goldman, George Bernard Shaw, Eugene Debs, Marie Stopes, Margaret Sanger, John Maynard Keynes, Lester Ward, and W. E. B. Du Bois were eugenicist agitators for the political Right? If so, she should supply her definition of 'Right,' since it would go against commonly accepted meanings. On the matter of colonialism and war, self-identified members of the Old Right such as Albert Jay Nock, John Flynn, and Senator Robert Taft advocated precisely the opposite of what McCloskey characterizes as 'Right.' These men opposed, among other things, military interventionism and adventurism. The trouble is that McCloskey's muddying of the signifiers 'Left' and 'Right' comes so early in the book—in the 'Exordium'— that readers may lose trust in her, question her credibility, and begin to suspect the labels and arguments in her later chapters. 
Other undefined terms only make matters worse, ensuring that McCloskey will alienate many academics, who, as a class, are already inclined to reject her libertarian premises. She throws around the term 'Romanticism' as if its referent were eminently clear and uncontested: 'a conservative and Romantic vision' (p. xviii); 'science fiction and horror fiction [are] … offshoots of Romanticism' (p. 30); '[Jane Austen] is not a Romantic novelist … [because] [s]he does not take Art as a model for life, and does not elevate the Artist to a lonely pinnacle of heroism, or worship of the Middle Ages, or adopt any of the other, antibourgeois themes of Novalis, [Franz] Brentano, Sir Walter Scott, and later Romantics' (p. 170); 'Romanticism around 1800 revived talk of hope and faith and a love for Art or Nature or the Revolution as a necessary transcendent in people's lives' (p. 171); 'Romantic candor' (p. 242); 'the late eighteenth-century Romantic literary critics in England had no idea what John Milton was on about [sic], because they had set aside the rigorously Calvinist theology that structured his poetry' (p. 334); 'the nationalist tradition of Romantic writing of history' (p. 353); 'Romantic … hostilities to … democratic rhetoric' (p. 510); '[i]n the eighteenth century … the idea of autonomy triumphed, at any rate among the progressive clerisy, and then became a leading Romantic idea, á la Victor Hugo' (p. 636); and 'the Romantic conservative Thomas Carlyle' (p. 643). 
To allege that the clerisy was 'thrilled by the Romantic radicalism of books like Mein Kampf or What Is to Be Done' (p. xviii) is also recklessly to associate the philosophies of, say, Keats or Coleridge or Wordsworth with the exterminatory fantasies of Hitler and Lenin. McCloskey might have guarded against this misleading conflation by distinguishing German idealism or contextualizing Hegel or by being more vigilant with diction and definition. Her loose language will leave some experts (I do not profess to be one) scratching or shaking their heads and, more problematic, some non-experts with misconceptions and misplaced targets of enmity. One imagines the overeager and well-meaning undergraduate, having read Bourgeois Equality, setting out to demonize William Blake or destroy the reputation of Percy Shelly, about whom Paul Cantor has written judiciously.2 Wouldn't originality, imagination, creativity, and individualism—widely accepted markers of Romanticism—appeal to McCloskey? Yet her unconditionally derogatory treatment of Romanticism—which she portrays as a fixed, monolithic, self-evident thing—undermines aspects of that fluctuating movement, period, style, culture, and attitude that are, or seem to be, consistent with her Weltanschauung. 
But I protest too much. These complaints should not diminish what McCloskey has accomplished. Would that we had more grand studies that mapped ideas and traced influences across cultures, communities, and eras. McCloskey takes the long view, as we all should. Her focus on rhetoric is crucial to the future of liberty if, given the technological advances we have made, the 'work we do will be more and more about decisions and persuading others to agree, changing minds, and less and less about implementation by hand' (p. 498). Equally significant is her embrace of humanomics—defined as 'the story [of] a complete human being, with her ethics and language and upbringing' (p. xx)—which materializes in casual references to Henrik Ibsen's plays, challenges to the depiction of John Milton 'as a lonely poet in a garret writing merely to the starry heavens' (p. 393), analyses of Jane Austen's novels, and portrayals of Elizabethan England. Her historical and narrative arc enables us to contextualize our own moment, with all of its troubles and possibilities. 
Best of all, her book is inspiring and exhilarating and brimming with rousing imperatives and moving calls to action. 'Let us, then,' she says at one point, 'not reject the blessings of economic growth on account of planning or pessimism, the busybody if wellintentioned rationalism of some voices of the French Enlightenment or the adolescent if charming doubts of some voices of the German Romantic movement, fashionable though both attitudes have long been among the clerisy. As rational optimists, let us celebrate the Great Enrichment, and the rhetorical changes in freer societies that caused it' (p. 146). At another point she encourages her audience to guard against 'both cynicism and utopianism' (p. 540), and elsewhere to heed 'trade-tested cooperation, competition, and conservation in the right mix' (p. 523). These little nudges lend her credibility insofar as they reveal her true colors, as it were, and demonstrate that she is not attempting—as is the academic wont—to hide her prejudices and conceal her beliefs behind pretended objectivities. 
Poverty is relative and, hence, permanent and ineradicable, despite McCloskey's claim that we can 'end poverty' (p. 8). If, tomorrow, we woke up and the wealth of each living person were magically to multiply twentyfold—even fiftyfold—there would still be people at the bottom. The quality of life at the bottom, however, would be vastly improved. The current manifestation of global poverty shows how far we as a species have advanced in the last few centuries. McCloskey is right: We should pursue the ideas that accelerated and achieved human flourishing, that demonstrably brought people out of distress and destitution. Hard sciences and mathematical models are insufficient in themselves to convey the magnitude and splendor of these ideas and their accomplishments. Hence we should welcome and produce more books like McCloskey's that undertake a 'rhetorical-ethical Revaluation' to both examine and celebrate 'a society of open inquiry,' one which not only 'depends on rhetoric in its politics and in its science and in its economy,' but which also yields intellectual creativity and political freedom (p. 650). In McCloskey's approach, economics and the humanities are not mutually exclusive; rather, they are mutually illuminating and, in fact, indispensably and inextricably tied. An economics that forsakes the dignity of the human person and his capacity for creativity and aesthetics does so at its own peril and to its own disgrace. All economics is, at its core, humanomics. We could do without the latter term if we understood the former. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew. Related Articles

Hillary To Be Indicted After Election: Trump Responds To FBI Investigation Clinton scrambles following FBI announcement on new email evidence Infowars.com - October 28, 2016 Comments 
Alex Jones breaks down the FBI's Friday announcement on the reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server as new evidence surfaces. 
The new data was reportedly uncovered during a separate investigation into Anthony Weiner – the husband of Clinton ally Huma Abedin. 
FBI Director James Comey cited 'recent developments' for the bureau's decision in a letter to committees and lawmakers today. 
'In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton's personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony,' Comey wrote. 
'In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.' 
These new revelations could undoubtedly spell trouble for Clinton as Trump has vowed to fully investigate her actions upon winning the election. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew. Related Articles

3 Competing Theories On Why The FBI Re-opened The Hillary Email Server Investigation The FBI normally avoids acting just before an election in order to avoid charges of political manipulation American Thinker   
There is no question that re-opening the FBI Investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server is a big deal. The FBI normally avoids acting just before an election in order to avoid charges of political manipulation. NBC reports: 
The FBI is reviewing a new batch of Hillary Clinton emails, bureau director James Comey said in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday. 
'In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation … I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,' he wrote. 
The very first thing to note is that Comey made no mention of a grand jury. The emails whose existence he learned of may have been the result of a subpoena in another investigation. If that is the case, further subpoenas are quite possible, a tool that was left unused in the investigation to date. 
There are 3 competing theories as to why he might be doing this now that come to mind. He might be seeking to restore his badly damaged reputation, recognizing that the damage he has inflicted on the FBI is substantial. Three days ago, American Thinker published an open letter from a retired FBI Agent, Hugh Galyean, that laid out some of the damage Comey has inflicted on the institution he leads. There is little doubt that this reached many in the FBI family, putting in print what people have only whispered about. If those silenced voices start speaking out, Comey could face a serious loss of face. In this scenario, he is heading off a staff rebellion, possibly including mass resignations. Rush Limbaugh today discussed an alternative theory, that by announcing an FBI Investigation resuming, Comey is putting a lid on further attention to Wikileaks. I guess this means that Clinton forces will argue we must wait for the investigation to be complete (after the election) before speaking about what the evil Russians are planting into our politics. It is possible that something so dramatic came up in the pertinent emails that postponing a public reaction by not announcing the reopening of the investigation would, be regarded as political interference by covering up a smoking gun until after the election. In this scenario, Comey is assuming the evidence cannot be suppressed, and that he would be held accountable after it comes out. This scenario also indicates that we could be headed for a constitutional crisis, involving the possible indictment of a president-elect before an election. Or the evidence being turned over to the House of Representatives for impeachment hearings. 
We'll know more in the coming days, and I am sure there are other possible theories and motives. It is shame that we have to speculate, and that the once-respected FBI director is now subject to analysis of his political gamesmanship.

Store 2006 Audio Emerges of Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election Unearthed tape: 'We should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win' Observer   
On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. 
The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. 
The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton's Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is 'rigged.' 
Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats).
