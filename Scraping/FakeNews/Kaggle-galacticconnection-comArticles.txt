Former Defense Minister of Canada, Paul Hellyer, has filed a lawsuit along with several others at the State Canada on the CETA treaty. CETA stands for comprehensive economic and trade agreement, a trade which are entered according to prosecutors constitutional and international rights of people with feet. Paul Hellyer called the treaty therefore Comprehensive Trade and Takeover Agreement. With this convention, which comes out of the hat of the international bankers, 62 families will obtain control over almost the entire world. Constitutions of member countries will no longer apply, only the will of the 62 families (the elite) will apply. 
The lawsuit was officially filed on October 21 of this year and actually consists of four 
namely separate indictments; the federal government does not have the constitutional authority to sign, execute and implement treaties without the express prior authority of Parliament through an Act of Parliament 
the federal government has no constitutional right to sign CETA and / or perform without having this treaty first by the Parliament through official channels. (2) the solid majority of the CETA articles and Their Impact encroach on exclusive Provincial spheres or forum-protected by the division of powers under the Constitution Act, 1867 
Most of the CETA provisions and their impact undermine exclusive legal rights protected by the Canadian Constitutional Law, 1867 the CETA gouge and extinguishes the constitutionally protected Judiciary in Canada by creating foreign tribunals to determining property and legal issues in Canada without any judicial oversight or Jurisdiction of the Canadian Courts over the disputes; and 
CETA removes the constitutional legal system by setting foreign tribunals have to judge between property and other legal issues without overlooked may be the Canadian legal system, and various articles of the CETA violate constitutional enshrined rights in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and over-rides Charter Guarantees That ground Canada's ability to mount public programs on Health, Education, Social Services, and public utilities-including the elimination of subsidies, monopolies, and state enterprises for public welfare. In short, the treaty places the rights of private foreign investors about Those of the Canadian Constitution and Canadian citizens. 
various provisions of CETA violated constitutional built-rights enshrined in the document Charter of Rights and Freedoms and transcend guaranteed rights that Canada has the opportunity to develop public programs in the fields of health, education, social services and public funds, including the termination of subsidies , monopolies and state enterprises for the public interest. In short, the treaty puts the interests of private foreign companies over those of the Canadian constitution and its inhabitants. 
But this is not all! Paul Hellyer, which is so you can immediately see and hear his call to Canadians and the rest of the world, his mind has put on the roll of the largest crime syndicate has ever known the world, the international bankers, international intertwined the main industries in which the owners of the revenues come from only 62 families. 
Paul Hellyer remembers the Canada which was separate from the bankers, yet not so long ago. Until 1974 the Canadian government expressed its money itself, there was no such thing as inflation, poverty and debt. Canada was one of the largest financiers behind the allies that Europe was liberated from the Germans at that time. Life was good, cheap and everyone had enough money to do the things they wanted to do. From one day to the issued money creation in 1974 the central banks and money was no longer free. Within a few years, Canada had a huge debt that is recovered just as us on the civilian population through numerous taxes. Paul Hellyer has evidence that this happened in unconstitutional manner and wants to decide turn back to Canada to give it right back himself pressing her money to spend. This affects every Canadian citizen a large sum of money to free education, health, housing, etc. can be paid without causing debts. Paul Hellyer does the same as Foundation for Our Money aims but in a turbo version! He lets no grass grow, does not perform educational skits for the people who maintain this crime for years, Paul Hellyer goes straight for the scapegoat. 
Now the video of Paul Hellyer where he explains personally exactly what is going on and how they want to approach this. 
Dear readers. This could be the big break. This information should be shared very broadly as to all countries under the thumb are the bankers, the same applies. We can deliver all of this unfair system where our benefit only a handful of people. The power over the creation of money is a sovereign matter since no one has more to do with it. We want a better and fairer world, then this is the opportunity that everyone has been waiting for! 
Privatized money is the reason for all wars, privatized money is the cause of poverty, oppression, exploitation, neglect of our elderly and less fortunate. Privatized money is the root of all evil on this beautiful planet. Now is the chance to get out from under the yoke, to stand up for the future of ourselves and our children. Now is the chance to rid the world of those people who make a huge mess for over 100 years with one goal, to keep the creation of money in their hands and with it the power over almost anything this planet has to offer. 
The Earth is not a handful of bankers and politicians, the earth belongs to everyone!

Posted by Madeline | Oct 26, 2016 | 2016 , Daily Blog | 0 | Thanks Heru! By Lisa Brown, 10/19/2016 I find it interesting to experience/observe. I can see their desire to expose/honor their hearts, yet their confusion at losing their masculine persona if they do. I can see their beauty, magnificence and purity of their soul and their not knowing how to BE a MAN and feel all this stuff emerging within them. I can also see them put stronger walls up trying their best to hold on to old realities not true anymore, fear of feeling, hurt, failure and losing control, letting anyone in, being let down, abandoned, judged'¦.. which do not occur on NEW Earth. 
It is no different than when we woke up (women and feminine energy men), yet it is, for they've lived this life of strength, of being powerful, of being strong and surviving everything. For the really really masculine energy man (or women, but we are talking about men right now), their softness brings forth fear of vulnerability'¦.. which is so totally the opposite, for we must allow ourselves that rawness/that vulnerability in order to truly feel again, to bring the walls of protection down, to not live in the fear of being alone'¦. 
When our soul awakens, we desire connection, deeply, yet we seek it in others first. Experience after experience activates our unworthiness, feeling of not-good-enough, lack of intimate lasting connection, rejected for not being 'enough' in others minds, where they are not in-tune with their own sacred soul. 
WE are in the vibrations of the very masculine man awakening now'¦. more and more. It's important to support them, show them that they can be masculine and honor their soul at the same time. It's important to open up and share, to show them it's safe to be seen. It's important to not impose, not pressure, not push'¦ just hold the space for them to open up on their own and not feel threatened as they do. It's important for the women to support the men now, yet in very different ways than before. 
Those who have opened their hearts KNOW that our relationships are very different here. We do not hold attachments, cords, expectations or needs anymore. All New Earth relationships are powerful, beautiful, freeing, supportive, empowering, inspiring and a co-creative experience of in-service to ourselves, each other and all on earth. They are to usher in the new era, this one now, through unity, peace, respect, support, contribution and Divine Love. 
Many men have been trying to wake up, going through their distortions, shedding old human needs and exchanging them for new desires to take their place in this new world now. The more human masculine energy, the more safety, protection and survival mechanisms there were. Judgment is huge and it's scary when your whole world starts to change for you and you don't have a choice anymore. 
Women, it's your time to step-up, to BE the one that already understands. To BE the one who holds that space and the STABILITY in place. When the old starts to collapse, crumble, dissolve, when emotions start to surface that you didn't know were there, when nothing makes sense and you don't understand why you can't keep it together anymore and be the one that everyone could depend on physically'¦. we all know what this is like'¦ we've been there. 
We've been through the collapse to move into creation of the new. To re-birth ourselves, our own realities and now the men do this too. There are many who were not ready before, yet those times (vibrations) are gone. You will start to see more men awaken, especially the strong ones, and the fear of 'how' to deal with this'¦ part of your job as an Ascended BEing, as a Master BEing, as a Light Tower and a Keeper of NEW Earth is to not just hold the space but show them how it's all not only going to be okay, it's going to be awesome. 
It doesn't matter what body we are in, female or male. Men now identify with their masculine bodies as an expectation that they are supposed to be the strong one, the providers, the one's that don't break'¦. when we know better'¦. 
When the soul awakens, the human aspect does break/dissolve, and it doesn't matter what bodies we are in. This process is genderless'¦ We all have human masculine, human feminine and we have Divine Masculine and Divine Feminine too. 
Relationships built or formed out of unconsciousness collapse, end, re-shape or transform, often all of these'¦.. Some go their separate ways while each evolves, awakens, dies/re-births/grows up as Spirit/Soul in physical body form. 
Many women's/partner's/friend's roles will be to support others and super masculine man now ready to open up. Just because they struggled before, resisted before, doesn't mean they still are/will. When you show them (WayShower) that you can handle it, you can be the support, you can even be the provider if need be, then they can honor themselves without the weight of everyone depending on them to do it all by themselves anymore. 
As masculine/feminine are re-defined, according to ENERGY and that each can fill all of these roles themselves, then the balance can shift easily, and each as they honor themselves and step up into their own roles, can support others ready to do this too. 
Financial support is also a part of this, which can be emasculating if viewed through human eyes. When one realizes that money is just energy to support us all, they let go of the mis-perceptions and definitions once held by who did what role. In the old paradigm, Money was associated with power, which was a masculine thing. NOW money is an expression of gratitude, love, respect, contribution and is to support those stepping into/fulfilling their SOUL's Purposes and Roles here. When the focus is taken off of money and put on what is truly important, the SOUL, then each can flourish, each can receive, each can share, each contributes the ENERGY of what is important to create a whole new reality of UNIFIED EXISTENCE here. 
Strength is through the purely open true warrior heart. Power is the knowledge and wisdom that comes through your own connection AS PURE SOURCE LIGHT within. Abundance is an existence. Divine Sacred Love is what makes the difference here. Union is when Souls come together, to work together, to be together and to bring forth realities consciously together. We all have to/had to do this ourselves so that we could create/anchor/hold the foundation of a whole new/remembered existence here. 
Your SOUL can see the awakening Soul of another. You can expand the space or shut it down/close portals. What's appropriate will be determined by how conscious, present and open each is'¦. As a Master, you have the capability to see, understand and do more than you did as a limited and lacking human. Your energy makes the difference'¦'¦'¦'¦. They are going to need to pull away, be alone, sleep and have someone to talk to without being judged. The human aspect doesn't believe it's safe to open up, without being attacked, judged or imposed upon. It's up to you to show that it is. Masculine energy believes it when they see it. You prove it by BEing your higher self all of the time. Their soul will emerge as you do. 
Higher Consciousness Existence. I love you. 
Lisa Transcendence Brown

Select Page Dakota Excess Pipeline? Standing Rock Protectors Strip-Searched, Jailed for Days on Minor Charges ' Video, Links, and Commentary Democracy Now! 
We discuss the crackdown on the resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline with Winona LaDuke, a Native American activist and executive director of the group Honor the Earth who lives and works on the White Earth Reservation in northern Minnesota, and Tara Houska, national campaigns director for Honor the Earth. Police have begun deploying military-grade equipment, including armored personnel carriers, surveillance helicopters, planes and drones. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple activated the National Guard in late September. Roughly 140 people have been arrested. Some report being strip-searched in custody at the Morton County jail and being held for days without bond, even when they are facing minor misdemeanor charges. TRANSCRIPT This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. 
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . We're broadcasting live from outside the courthouse and jail in Mandan, North Dakota. Water and land protectors, as they call themselves, report facing increasing repression amidst the ongoing resistance to the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline. Police have begun deploying military-grade equipment, including armored personnel carriers, surveillance helicopters, planes and drones. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple activated the National Guard in late September. Roughly 140 people have been arrested. Some report being strip-searched in custody at the Morton County jail, even when they're facing minor misdemeanor charges. This is Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle, a pediatrician on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. 
DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE : When I was taken to the jail, first I was taken by a corrections officer, transported from the protest site to the Morton County jail. And then, when they took me in there, you know, they had to take some basic information. And then, one of the things that they do is have you go into a small room, and there was a female officer there, and we had to'I had to take my clothes off, and then, I don't know, basically' 
AMY GOODMAN : Cavity search? 
DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE : No, not a cavity search, but I had to squat and cough. That's what she said. I had to squat and cough and then put the orange suit on. 
AMY GOODMAN : So you were put in an orange jumpsuit? 
DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE : Yeah, I was put in an orange jumpsuit. And then I was held there for several hours. And initially, you know, my family didn't know where I was or didn't'you know, they heard about it pretty quickly and were able to come and bond me out or bail me out. I don't know what you call it. But I was in there for several hours. 
AMY GOODMAN : How did it make you feel? 
DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE : It made me feel'you know, it made me think about my ancestors and what had they gone through. And this was in no way a comparison to what we've survived before, so just made me feel more determined about what I'm doing and why I'm here. 
AMY GOODMAN : That's Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle, a pediatrician, member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. She was charged with disorderly conduct. LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, who founded the first resistance camp, the Sacred Stone Camp, on her own land April 1st, says her daughter was recently arrested, taken into custody at the Morton County jail, strip-searched in front of multiple male officers, then left for hours in her cell, naked and freezing, before the guards finally gave her clothes to wear. LaDonna Allard says her daughter was repeatedly asked by guards, 'Who is your mother?' which Allard sees as an indication that her daughter was targeted because of who she is. Cody Hall from Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota says he was also strip-searched after he was arrested Friday, September 9th, held for three days without bail or bond, and then charged with two misdemeanors. 
CODY HALL : As I exited out of the vehicles and entered Morton County, I came up an elevator, and as the elevator opened up, I was met with state police. And then, you know, of course, Morton County people were there to book people, but'and then, from there, started the process of the booking, and then, again, you know, went into a private room, where they ask you to, you know, get naked. You know, they had my arms. They, you know, kind of like extend your arms out. And you're fully naked. And they have you, you know, lift up your genitals and bend over, you know, cough. And so, it's really one of those tactics that they try to break down your mentalness of everyday life, because not every day do you wake up and say, 'Hey, I'm going to get, you know, naked and have somebody search me today,' you know? That's a private'you know, that's a private feeling for you, when you get naked, so'¦ 
AMY GOODMAN : And four days later, when you were finally released'they hadn't allowed you to go out on bail or bond for those four days'you came before a judge in the orange jumpsuit? 
CODY HALL : Yes, yes, I sat in the court office in my orange jumpsuit, locked, you know, still handcuffed, exited out of the courtroom. And as I left the courtroom, there were 20 or so state police all in their bullet-proof vests, everything just looking, you know, like'you know, like they're going into action of some sort. And then they literally had a line from the courtroom to the door that connects you to the county jail. And my mother walked out with me. And as we got to the door, they were opening the door up. And as I looked behind me, my mother and I, all of the cops then proceeded to kind of swarm, you know, like make, you know, that big wall as I entered in, which was, again, an overkill, you know, but that, too, though, to show a dominant force. 
AMY GOODMAN : That was Cody Hall, who was arrested on two misdemeanors, held for four days, strip-searched here at the Morton County jail just behind us. 
Well, for more on the resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline and the police crackdown, we're joined by two guests. Winona LaDuke, Native American activist, executive director of the group Honor the Earth, she lives and works on the White Earth Reservation in northern Minnesota. And we're joined by Tara Houska, national campaigns director for Honor the Earth. She is Ojibwe from the Couchiching First Nation. 
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Winona, let's start with you. We have spoken to you intermittently through this resistance. Where does it stand now? 
WINONA LADUKE : Well, as far as we are in'I mean, I'm just looking at the big picture. Right now there is about 900,000 barrels per day of oil coming out of this state, and they project that into 2019. And so, what I'm trying to understand is, is that if that's all they have and it's already going out, why do they need another pipeline of 570,000 barrels of oil per day? In other words, they're already meeting all their demand. For the next two years, that's all the oil that's in there. And this is really'what we call this is the Dakota Excess pipeline. 
AMY GOODMAN : The Dakota Excess. 
WINONA LADUKE : Dakota Excess pipeline. This is really about spites. It's really about spite. 
AMY GOODMAN : What do you mean? 
WINONA LADUKE : It's just really about hating. You know, it's just really about trying to put something in across these tribes. It's exactly what the chairman and you said before: If they wanted this pipeline so damn bad, they should have put it north of Bismarck, you know, and they should have'they should not have violated the law. The whole pipeline was approved through something called the Nationwide Permit number 12, which means they could it into a lot of little pieces and never do an EIS , and pretend like'you know, that's intended for like if you have like a pipeline from a school to the water service center or something like that. It's not intended for a 1,600-mile pipeline. Total misuse of the law, you know, and the president really needs to intervene and uphold the law'¦Read more and watch video at Democracy Now!

Planetary Activation Organization 12 Lamat, 11 Tzec, 13 Caban Selamat Jalwa! The process of clearing this land of its human vermin continues. The minions of this realm remain easy to find and arrest. They truly believe that the Light cannot obstruct their positions of power. Swiftly, they are discovering an awful truth. Their errant ways can no longer be tolerated. The rule of the dark is quickly ending and being replaced by various versions of 'GESARA.' When the clearing of this unholy riff-raff is complete, those who hold the funds are to easily let this immense wealth run its course across this globe. You are to receive an abundance that is to forever end the wicked hoarding of the dark and its foolish minions. Never forget how the dark so evilly prevented you from receiving the resources that you urgently need to remake this reality. It is vital that you see this immense wealth as a way to ensure that your dreams come true. It is your confident and successful dreaming that is to allow you to let go of your unfounded fears and continuing belief that you are less than others. You are all a wondrous union of potential that needs to manifest in every way possible. 
Be able to see yourself as a most valuable member of this global union and learn of your sovereign right to manifest your dreams. That is how this collective can produce creative solutions for a new reality. You have within you a profound wisdom. Do not think your dreams are unworthy. You are an important part of this collection of surface humanity. Constantly connect to one another and in so doing, realize how this continually flowing set is contributing to the changing of the whole. Adopt a position where you intuitively realize that this never-ending operation is framing your new reality. We are here, as is Heaven, to oversee this process. Feel free to contribute your own wonderfulness to this organic whole. Let the old ways and beliefs go. This is to be a new time, filled with freedom and prosperity. You need to let go of the control issues planted in you so meticulously by the dark. Welcome the playfulness of the Light and discover the magnificence of who you really are. This is just the precursor for this new age of spiritual discovery! 
This new age of discovery is really about understanding how the Light creates its realities. You are quickly learning this, and getting a glimpse into its exquisite intricacies. This new life of yours is to be founded upon your dreams and the operation of the Light within. You have long been in denial of how to transform by learning to truly be yourself. Long ago, you were a picture of inner creativity. The limits taught by those around you began at first to hinder you. Later, those limits turned into the walls that now enclose you. This imposed sense of limitation needs to be cracked open and totally abandoned. Instead, you require a new prototype. One that, seeing again your primitive playfulness, lets it take over. You feel, somehow, that this process is inappropriate. You need to end this feeling. Replace it with a need to see just how you can measure where you fit into the whole. This gauge is within you. Spirit gave it to you when you were born. All that is required is to know how to recognize it. This is the task that our mentors intend to explore with you. 
Begin, therefore, to explore how it feels to be limitless in your resources. Look inside and, with intent, carefully explore your priorities for each of your dreams and how they fit into a magnificent whole. Use this grand framework to determine how you wish to manifest them. This, of course, is just a start. Look around and discuss all of this with your closest friends and family. We intend to fully expand this with you. Our mentors' first task is to allow you to let go of fears and any other deep perceptions that can limit you. Our desire is to have you discover how amazing you truly are. This process is needed to empower you to eliminate your old perceptions. Ever bear in mind that you have an immense potential that is to be expanded to whatever you are able to perceive. This potential is a major element that your mentor is to weave and then explore with you. This operation may take some time to fully understand. We therefore intend to show you how this plan can open you to comprehensively fulfill your dreams. In this lies the key to your vast potential! 
Namaste! We are your Ascended Masters! We come to emphasize the fact that your realm is changing for the better. Those who doubt this change need only look around and see that the posturing of the dark and its many minions has yielded nothing but distraught hopes for a success that is now truly unattainable. It is essential that those who hold visions similar to our own realize that this new world is indeed at hand! Let us together request first of Heaven and then demand of our governments that a system of governance be implemented for all to see. Heaven set up a timetable with the dark. The time draws near, Dear Ones, when this miracle is to manifest. Therefore be ready to explain, when approached, that the new ways come to rejoice! In this joy we can all leave undisturbed the years of frustration. Let go of all the tragedy that surrounds you. This is a time when your many dreams are to manifest and the old ways are finally to be done with. Let this bell of freedom ring out again and again throughout this realm! 
Each of you since childhood has had a series of special wishes that were modified many times as you grew older. Liberate these grand visions. Acknowledge how deeply they can bring you great joy. Heaven sincerely wishes to make all of this happen. The wealth and benefits that make it possible for this to be realized are what all in Heaven intend to accomplish. The exalted Creator of all has been decreeing this for millennia. As we have mentioned before, a divine timetable is in effect. This time has been divinely set. This sacred time is near. We Masters are doing all that is necessary to bring this glorious moment to Gaia. Developments are currently underway to achieve this sacred event. Thus, it is necessary for you to bring forth your light so that this event may unfold now. Thus, it is essential that all be diligent in manifesting the last grand event. Please persevere in this task. 
Long ago, the surface of this realm seemed extremely dismal. The Anunnaki were everywhere. Their dark deeds, intensified by the insanity of ritual murders and constant war, were the rule of the day. In the past century and a half, this darkness has begun slowly to lift. Now you are at the very edge of the Age of Light. What at one time seemed impossible is to occur. Now that this growing consciousness has reached a general awareness, some mighty miracles are coming to pass. Continue to work for the Light! Know that the darkness is slipping away. We Masters notice this every day. Become ever more confident of this. The dark is being forced to relinquish its torture of you. Potential wars will not come to fruition. An aura of peace is descending upon this blessed land. A time for wondrous events to suddenly appear is indeed near. Never lose your faith! Remain positive and expect even more miracles to occur! 
Today, we have reported yet again what is unfolding around this precious orb! Announcements for many things long wished for are in place! A new time for all is upon us! Be prepared to be a most joyous part of this! Know, dear Ones, that the countless supply and never-ending prosperity of Heaven are indeed yours! So Be It! Selamat Gajun! Selamat Ja! (Sirian for Be One! and Be in Joy!)

Project Hemisphere, a secretive program developed by AT&T, searches trillions of call records in order to analyze cell phone data, spying on the activity of private individuals in order to identify who they are speaking with and why, as well as GPS tracking on the location of each individual connected to the call, and it transmits this information to the Department of Justice (DOJ). 
In 2013, Project Hemisphere was shown in a PowerPoint presentation produced by the Drug Enforcement Administration. The New York Times reported this as a partnership between AT&T and the DOJ, primarily deployed for drug-enforcement task-forces. All information collected in this program is accessible to the federal agencies authorized by the DOJ. 
AT&T specifically developed and marketed this product for use by the DOJ, who would promise hundreds of millions in funds on behalf of taxpayers, using the taxpayers' own money to spy on their every move. This is an invasion of privacy without a warrant. This is a federal spy program by proxy, working through corporations. 
AT&T promises law enforcement that it will not disclose Project Hemisphere's involvement in active investigations that are made public. AT&T is is attempting to lower liability for their customer and limit scrutiny to information transmitted to federal agencies through their network. 
While it should not be surprising that your cell phone company is working with bureaucrats to collect incriminating evidence on you, there is a staggering number of people who still carelessly use their cell phone as if the information being transmitted through the device will be kept private. 
News flash! It's never been private. They have always wanted to use your information as a product to sell to the highest bidder. Your data is their product, and you are paying them to take it from you.

Select Page After terrorizing America with Zika scaremongering, Washington Post now admits Zika virus doesn't cause brain deformities after all 
Posted by Madeline | Oct 26, 2016 | 2016 , Daily Blog | 0 | Thanks Nancy!
Natural News 
(NaturalNews) The entire leftist media is not merely dishonest and corrupt, their science writers are unbelievably stupid and ill-informed about nearly everything in the natural world. Today, after months of printing fear-inducing 'Zika terrorism' stories that scared America half to death while convincing the government to funnel billions of dollars into Zika vaccine research for Big Pharma, the Washington Post now admits it had no idea what it was talking about . 
But rather than admitting its own science writers were scientifically illiterate propagandists pushing quack narratives as news, the paper now blames other scientists for the gross error by publishing a headline that's once again dishonest and deceptive: 'Scientists are bewildered by Zika's path across Latin America,' it proclaims. 
Bewildered about 'Zika's path?' The story headline should actually read, 'Zika HOAX revealed'¦ it doesn't cause brain damage after all.' (Read it at this link .) Washington Post has been shamelessly pushing the Zika HOAX for months'¦ with no apology to readers 
In the story, writers Dom Phillips and Nick Miroff essentially reveal that what the Washington Post has been writing about the Zika virus has been based entirely in government propaganda and pandemic lies pushed by the CDC, which of course has close ties to the criminal vaccine industry: 
Nearly nine months after Zika was declared a global health emergency, the virus has infected at least 650,000 people in Latin America and the Caribbean, including tens of thousands of expectant mothers. 
But to the great bewilderment of scientists, the epidemic has not produced the wave of fetal deformities so widely feared when the images of misshapen infants first emerged from Brazil. 
Yes, the Washington Post now says the scientists are 'bewildered' that their apocalyptic scare stories that caused female athletes to skip out on the Rio Olympics and scared tens of millions of Americans into poisoning themselves with DEET (a neurotoxic chemical) turned out to be total hogwash. DEET, by the way, combines with carbamate class pesticides to cause neurological dysfunction in humans , which coincidentally increases the number of people who watch CNN or read the Washington Post. 
For the record, no one who reads Natural News is surprised by this revelations that has left mainstream scientists 'bewildered.' It's not bewildering to me. I called Zika a total hoax from day one, pointing out that the brain deformities were caused by larvacide chemicals dumped into the water supply , not by Zika. See some of my stories that clearly spelled all this out months before the Washington Post had any clue what they were writing about: 
March 2, 2016: Zika PAYDAY! Obama wants to funnel $1.8 billion for vaccine research and more 
I even published a mini-documentary revealing the published science that shows how DEET insecticide causes brain damage in humans. You can watch it at this link or view the video below: 
If anyone from the Washington Post bothered to read Natural News and learn about real science, they would have learned that Zika has infected tens of millions of people throughout South America for decades , with absolutely no measurable increase in neurological deformations. (But facts be damned, the WashPost had a panic to push!) Nation after nation records tens of thousands of infections with ZERO birth defects'¦ 
Despite the factual reality of the situation, the state-controlled propagandists writing for rags like the Washington Post ' a bogus newspaper that has lost all credibility in the minds of intelligent people ' continued to pummel home their kooky science theories that claimed much of the U.S. South would be overrun by brain damaging mosquitoes, turning Southerners into shrunken-brained mutants while pregnant women fled northward to survive the airborne insect onslaught. 
Instead, nothing happened . No explosion in shrunken-headed babies. No wave of birth defects across Florida, even as city officials desperately bombarded their own cities with brain-damaging insecticides. No national emergency declared by Obama to bring back DDT and eradicate baby-murdering mosquitoes by dousing our open streets with thick clouds of organophosphate neurotoxins. 
Instead, the rate of neurological birth defects in most countries approached zero. Via the Washington Post's own graphic: (partial list) 
Venezuela: 60,791 Zika infections'¦ ZERO birth defects Honduras: 31,933 Zika infections'¦ ONE birth defect Guadalupe: 30,969 Zika infections'¦ ZERO birth defects Puerto Rico: 29,084 Zika infections'¦ TWO birth defects Mexico: 4,837 Zika infections'¦ ZERO birth defects 
From the WashPost article: 
Brazilian officials were bracing for a flood of fetal deformities as Zika spread this year to other regions of the country, Marinho said. However, 'we are not seeing a big increase.' 
Gee, really? 
The vast majority of the brain defects, it turns out, came from just one small region of Brazil. A total of 2,033 children are so far recorded with neurological defects there, even while most other countries throughout the region had ZERO birth defects (or near zero). 
So what gives? Zika mosquitoes apparently carry geopolitical maps so they can solely target Brazil 
You don't have to be a genius to figure out that the stupid science theories of the mainstream media are total hokum and bunk . If Zika really did cause brain defects, it would have spread all across South America by now. It would have spread into Florida, California, Mississippi and Louisiana. It would have devastated the American South, Cuba, Haiti, Curacao and all the other island nations across the Caribbean. 
Yet the neurological defects were limited almost exclusively to Brazil. 
Somehow, if we believe the illiterate Washington Post science writers ' who may in fact be the only brain damage victims of Zika in North America ' mosquitoes carry MAPS to make sure they only activate their brain damage voodoo in Brazil . 
''¦[A]lthough the outbreak has spread this year to more than 50 nations and territories across the Western Hemisphere, U.N. data shows just 142 cases of congenital birth defects linked to Zika so far outside Brazil,' says WashPost. 
Yes, my friends: GPA-carrying Zika mosquitoes are very careful to limit their pandemic voodoo to just one region of Brazil. By sheer coincidence, that's the same region where larvacide chemicals were dumped into the public water supply. 
Apparently, there isn't a single 'official' scientist in the entire global government who has thought to test the water. Just freaking WOW'¦ Let's throw these morons out of power in every election, okay? They don't deserve any positions of authority over anyone else. They're all so incredibly stupid, they couldn't survive at all unless they functioned as parasites on the taxpayers. They aren't giving up hope just yet'¦ science writers desperately hope for more brain damaged babies to prove them right 
Enthusiasm for more brain damaged babies runs high at the Washington Post, which explains why they are all in for Hillary Clinton, the candidate of choice for brain damaged adults . Writing with a sense of real enthusiasm, the Washington Post can't wait for more brain damaged babies to appear: 
Scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are closely watching Puerto Rico, which has reported more than 26,800 cases of Zika. More than 7,000 pregnant women could be infected by the end of the year, according to the CDC. (Yippee?) 
And now, the loony tunes quack science of the Zika 'scientists' goes apoplectic, grasping for silly metaphors to try to obscure the fact that they are all stupid beyond belief . Via the WashPost: 
'Now we've settled on Zika as the smoking gun, but we don't know who pulled the trigger,' said Marques, speaking from Recife, where he is working with government researchers. 
Huh? Wha? The metaphor doesn't even make any sense. 
Maybe the problem is too much fornicating. Seriously, this is now part of their idiotic theory: 
'Sexual habits and hygiene may also play a role,' he said, explaining that researchers are looking at whether sexual transmission can infect the uterus and placenta with the virus, potentially exposing the fetus to elevated risk. 'We suspect the villain has an accomplice, but we don't know who it is,' Marques said. 
Huh? Do they seriously think that people only have sex in Brazil but not other South American countries? Where does the Washington Post find these morons? I'm a real scientist saying all this 
As you read all this, remember that I have rapidly become one of the world's leading research scientists on the quantitation of cannabinoids in hemp extracts using mass spec instrumentation. I led the team that developed the most pioneering (and accurate) CBD mass spec analysis method in existence today. You can read about it at this link . I also routinely test water, food and environmental samples for heavy metals, pesticides and a multitude of chemical contaminants. When I say these Zika scientists are complete morons, that's the educated opinion of an accomplished scientist correctly pointing out the lunacy of Zika scaremongering. 
I could have solved this entire problem in the first few days by analyzing and detecting brain-damaging larvacide chemicals in the public water supply in Eastern Brazil. The entire project would have taken just a few days and cost almost nothing. Instead, Obama handed $1.8 billion to the vaccine companies in the midst of the Zika panic pushed by laughable rags like the Washington Post. It's all a racket, of course, just like their coverage of elections and political candidates. Everything you read at the Washington Post is a deception of one kind or another . The paper exists solely to promote the propaganda of the state so that the population can be manipulated and controlled. The Washington Post exists to terrorize the citizens with fascist propaganda parading as science 
As you've also learned by now, the corrupt leftist establishment of junk science, criminal politicians and idiotic journalists isn't interested in legitimate scientific solutions . They all function as extensions of a fascist state that must routinely terrorize its citizens with pandemic boogeyman scare stories in order to demand absolute obedience to the vaccine mandates that actually do damage the brains of children. 
Thus, SCIENCE be damned. They've got an agenda to push, and it doesn't matter to them whether that agenda is based on a single shred of real science. Zika is dangerous because they told you so, in exactly the same way they told you Hillary Clinton is totally honest, Obamacare would make health care more affordable, there's no such thing as voter fraud in America, and GMOs and vaccines are really, really good for you. 
So you can put down the DEET and stop poisoning your skin like an obedient idiot. Yes, it was all a scam. Yes, the official 'science' was totally rigged. Yes, the media lied to you yet again. Yes, the CDC is a criminal racket. Yes, all the health 'officials' were completely full of s**t. And no, Zika is not going to cause your babies to be born with shrunken heads. VACCINES, on the other hand, will most definitely cause brain damage, as they still contain mercury, a potent neurotoxin the Washington Post ridiculously insists becomes magically neutralized when you inject it into the body of a child.

Humans Are Free The Pacific Ocean ' in fact almost one-third of the Globe ' is thought to have been contaminated from the leak out from the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), seeking to promote the peaceful use of Nuclear Power , in 2011 established with the Regional Cooperative Agreement (RCA) Member States, a joint IAEA Technical Cooperation (TC) project in the region of the Pacific Ocean. 
It was established after the Fukushima disaster when a tsunami caused by a major earthquake on 11 March 2011, disabled the power supply and cooling of three Fukushima Daiichi reactors, causing a nuclear accident. 
As a result, a large quantity of radioactive material was admitted into the Pacific Ocean. A field study found that two filter cartridges were coated, which showed elements of cesium, a radioactive substance. 
Of no surprise, this caused great concern to countries based around the Pacific Ocean due to the potential economic and environmental implications. The TC project's aim was therefore, to monitor the presence of radioactive substances in the marine environment. 
The first annual review meeting held in August 2012 demonstrated predictive hydrodynamic models and they predicted that the strong current, known as the Kuroshio Current and its extension, had the ability to transport the radioactive substances across the Pacific Ocean in an easterly direction. 
However, the concentration of radioactivity was not as high as originally thought. 
The massive expansion of ocean had diluted it substantially so radioactivity remained at low levels but there was still concern over contamination of seafood even at these low levels. 
The marine monitoring project was therefore, established to ensure that the seafood of the region was safe for consumption and to maintain a comprehensive overview and full facts of the situation, considering its grave implications. Documents Say Navy Knew #Fukushima Dangerously Contaminated the USS Reagan: http://t.co/hUomqT92e2 
' trutherbotred (@trutherbotred) July 9, 2015 
The TC is due to conclude this year. A few results have caused concern. 
A field study they conducted on 2 July 2014, revealed from two sets of seawater samples, found that two filter cartridges were coated, which showed elements of cesium, a radioactive substance. 
Then recently, trace amounts of cesium-134 and cesium-137 turned up in samples collected near Vancouver Island in British Columbia . 
The samples collected were separate from the monitoring project set up by IAEA but it is thought the only possible source of these radioactive elements is Fukushima, according to the Integrated Fukushima Ocean Radionuclide Monitoring (InFORM) Network. 
This is the first time that traces of cesium-134 had been detected near North America. 
While these are trace amounts, the danger of radioactive material in any amount cannot be underestimated. However, the experts say that these levels detected cannot really harm us, they are still lower than those we could be exposed to from a dental x-ray for instance. 
Having said that, every possible exposure, in any small amount, adds up. The problem with nuclear energy and fallout, the radiation and radioactive materials can travel far and wide with the wind and with the sea. 
Therefore, we should aim on a global level to keep these levels at zero. In any event the continuous monitoring of oceans will need to be conducted, according to Ken Buesseler, a marine chemist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute . 
What Buesseler says should be taken on board beyond 2015, particularly since the advice from the IAEA is to dump even more contaminated water into the sea. This is apparently more desirable than holding it in tanks. 
Any discharge will have to be controlled and continuous monitoring would be needed, in particular near the plant to improve data reliability. 
This is causing concern and not just to state authorities. Consider the fishermen. Every time they catch fish in the ocean, the fish need to be tested for radioactivity. 
Before any further dumping is done, the IAEA and Tokyo Electric Power Co., who control the plant, need to consider not only the environmental impact but socio-economic impact as well. 
Livelihoods could be affected as well as long-term health of the region and global community eventually.

Posted by Madeline | Oct 26, 2016 | 2016 , Daily Blog | 0 | Published on Oct 26, 2016 As I embrace my deep emotion, And strive for conflict resolution, I live a life of full expression, Not shutdown by fear or suppression. 
Feeling it comin'? New Moon in Scorpio this weekend sets the tone for the month ahead, themes, needs, issues, etc. And that means 'shadow work,' looking at all the deep dark needs, feelings, fears, and impulses that, when still unconscious, take us where we really don't want to go and cause effects we regret in the future. So onward and upward is feeling, talking about, expressing, and just flat out being aware of ourselves. 
Whether you agree or disagree with the observations made in this video I hope they are food for thought and a springboard for further discussion within your circles of relationship. In this way, we can all become more aware of the socio-cultural-religious-educational conditioning going on so as to identify more clearly for ourselves and our children just what kind of life we want to propagate on this planet! Injoy!

The October 30th New Moon falls in the dreamy and introspective sign of Scorpio. Even though Scorpio energy can be deep and dark, there is a way to channel this energy into something productive and even, magical. 
The energy of the October New Moon is going to guide us away from the material and external world and into a deeper, more intuitive realm. Here we will be able to receive new ideas, new inspirations and new creative visions. 
In fact, the energy of this New Moon has a high creative and supernatural charge to it and we will all be guided to go deep within, so we can remind ourselves about who we really are. 
There has been a lot of cleansing and releasing energy in the Universe this year, and while October's New Moon will be asking us to go deep, it will be asking us to venture deeper than our problems and deeper than our fears, all the way into the heart of our soul. 
This New Moon is about reconnecting with who you are, celebrating yourself and learning how to love and accept yourself exactly as you are. 
There is also a transformative energy to this New Moon, which will be allowing us to emerge reborn. 
This transformative energy is gentle, supportive and calming. It will be reminding us to nurture and care for ourselves. It will also be reminding us that sometimes the greatest healing we can offer ourselves is our own true love. 
Scorpio energy supports us to dive deep into our imagination and intuition. Use the force of this New Moon to travel within and get lost in the fairytales of your mind. Use the energy to inspire your creative visions and to expand your intuition. 
The New Moon also falls just one day before All Hallows Eve , making the Scorpio New Moon even more magical. 
Halloween is a time when the veil between dimensions is thinnest and this New Moon will definitely be amplifying this energy. 
Spirit energy will be high around this New Moon, so it is important to protect yourself energetically and stay open to any Divine messages or inspiration you may receive. 
In fact, if there is something that you have been looking to receive guidance on, this New Moon will allow you to take the journey within so you can hear the answer radiating from your own soul. 
The Scorpio New Moon will also allow us to take a journey into the underworld. 
The underworld is our subconscious and the deeper, darker, more intuitive side of who we are. It is when we are in this place that we can truly understand the power and magnificence of our own light. 
By losing our attachment to the external and going deep into the energy of the night, we will be able to realize and feel our potential shining through. 
For those who already experienced a New Moon on October 1st, this second New Moon will be a Black Moon. 
While the energy of the Black Moon is the same, there is a heightened energy when two New Moon's fall in the same month. Those experiencing the Black Moon are going to feel the effects even stronger and will be encouraged to dig that little bit deeper. 
This digging process is not about assessing, reviewing or analyzing, instead this digging process is about feeling. It is about feeling the soil and the earth around you, it is about feeling who you really are and allowing yourself to get lost in You. 
We are not our bodies and we are not our thoughts. We are soul energy and when we can travel within to feel this soul energy, we intuitively gain an understanding about who we are and where we are heading. 
If you allow the energy of the Scorpio New Moon in, you are going to be able to feel your soul; you are going to be able to feel your energy on a powerful level and you are going to be able to transform yourself with the power of your own love. 
The October New Moon is beautiful, magical and supportive, so allow its energy to guide you. Allow yourself to be taken by the energy and see where you travel to. Share:

The Moore Show Published on Oct 16, 2016 Since the late 1940s, a growing number of individuals and groups have sought public disclosure of what the authorities know about interaction between humans and non-human intelligences. But for 70 years the authorities have employed a policy of secrecy, denial and ridicule to keep the subject convert. Thus the responsibility of reporting and analyzing these contact phenomena has fallen to those called in various ways to participate. We Are the Disclosure is an embodiment of the bottom-up Disclosure process that has been underway for seven decades. Through in-depth interviews, it provides a people's history of the development of the field since the early days, and brings it up to date. Leading researchers in the field are joined by archeologists, radio hosts, a remote viewer, those engaging in direct ET contact, and several ET-human hybrids. This broad-ranging survey of the growth of this field, and our awareness of its meaning, is discussed in Part I of We Are the Disclosure by Alexis Brooks, Lyn Buchanan, Michael Cremo, Klaus Dona, Stanton Friedman, Robert Fullington, Marilyn Gewacke, Rey Hernandez, Gary Heseltine, C. B. Scott Jones, Jujuolui Kuita, Barbara Lamb, Vanessa Lamorte and Joanne Summerscales. This book provides strong evidence that Disclosure may prove to be the most important topic of our time, and that it is being driven in large part by the ETs themselves. Coast to coast AM 2016

ARJUN WALIA OCTOBER 18, 2016 Tensions between the United States, their allies, and Russia continue to rise. It seems, as always, that we are on the brink of global war. The Western military industrial complex continues to take over the Middle East and arm ISIS and other terrorist groups, as well as establish and solidify their military presence throughout the world. The sheer number of United States military bases around the globe is astonishing. 
For more, unbiased information on the current state of affairs between the United States and Russia, I recommend visiting theantimedia.org. 
Mainstream media outlets continue to spread propaganda , and have been doing so for years, claiming that there are terrorists, that they threaten national security, and that we must go after them. At the same time, an inflated sense of patriotism is encouraged in American citizens, so they believe their soldiers are fighting for freedom, despite doing the precise opposite. 
A great quote by Edward Bernays, who was known as the father of public relations, comes to mind here: 
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society . Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. ( source ) 
A number of politicians and academics from around the world have been trying to create awareness on this issue for decades, and although we've come a long way, our relatively slow progress demonstrates the stranglehold mainstream media has on the minds of the masses. 
'The statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince himself the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception.' 
' Mark Twain ( source ) 
Below, you'll find 15 quotes on false flag terrorism and the secret government. False flag terrorism refers to the idea that terrorist attacks are created, perpetuated, and/or funded by Western governments and their allies in order to justify the infiltration of other countries for ulterior motives. Quotes on False Flag Terrorism and the Secret Government 
1. The Dalia Lama 
'Of course, war and the large military establishments are the greatest sources of violence in the world. Whether their purpose is defensive or offensive, these vast powerful organizations exist solely to kill human beings. We should think carefully about the reality of war. Most of us have been conditioned to regard military combat as exciting and glamorous ' an opportunity for men to prove their competence and courage. Since armies are legal, we feel that war is acceptable; in general, nobody feels that war is criminal or that accepting it is criminal attitude. In fact, we have been brainwashed. War is neither glamorous nor attractive. It is monstrous. Its very nature is one of tragedy and suffering.' 
'Modern warfare waged primarily with different forms of fire, but we are so conditioned to see it as thrilling that we talk about this or that marvelous weapon as a remarkable piece of technology without remembering that, if it is actually used, it will burn living people. War also strongly resembles a fire in the way it spreads. If one area gets weak, the commanding officer sends in reinforcements. This is throwing live people onto a fire. But because we have been brainwashed to think this way, we do not consider the suffering of individual soldiers. No soldiers want to be wounded or die. None of his loved ones wants any harm to come to him. If one soldier is killed, or maimed for life, at least another five or ten people ' his relatives and friends ' suffer as well. We should all be horrified by the extent of this tragedy, but we are too confused.' 
'But no matter how malevolent or evil are the many murderous dictators who can currently oppress their nations and cause international problems, it is obvious that they cannot harm others or destroy countless human lives if they don't have a military organisation accepted and condoned by society.' ( source ) 
2. Dr. Michel Chossudovsky, Canadian economist, the University of Ottawa's Emeritus Professor of Economics 
'We are dealing with a criminal undertaking at a global level . . . and there is an ongoing war, it is led by the United States, it may be carried out by a number of proxy countries, which are obeying orders from Washington . . . The global war on terrorism is a US undertaking, which is fake, it's based on fake premises. It tells us that somehow America and the Western world are going after a fictitious enemy, the Islamic state, when in fact the Islamic state is fully supported and financed by the Western military alliance and America's allies in the Persian Gulf. . . . They say Muslims are terrorists, but it just so happens that terrorists are Made in America. They're not the product of Muslim society, and that should be abundantly clear to everyone on this floor. . . . The global war on terrorism is a fabrication, a big lie and a crime against humanity.' 
'Al Qaeda and the Al Qaeda affiliated organizations, including the Islamic State, are not independent organizations, they are sponsored, and they are sponsored by the United States and its allies. It is documented that prior to 2011, there was a process of recruitment of mujahideen to fight in Syria, and this was coordinated by NATO and the Turkish high command. This report is confirmed by Israeli news sources and unequivocally, we are dealing with a state-sponsorship of terrorism, the recruitment of mercenaries, the training and the financing of terrorism.' ( source )( source ) 
3. Paul Hellyer 
'It is ironic that the U.S. would begin a devastating war, allegedly in search of weapons of mass destruction, when the most worrisome developments in this field are occurring in your own backyard. It is ironic that the U.S. should be fighting monstrously expensive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, allegedly to bring democracy to those countries, when it itself can no longer claim to be called a democracy, when trillions, and I mean thousands of billions of dollars have been spent on projects about which both the Congress and the Commander in Chief have been kept deliberately in the dark.' ( source ) 
4. John C. Calhoun, The 7th Vice President of the United States 
'A power has risen up in the government greater than the people themselves, consisting of many, and various, and powerful interests, combined into one mass, and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in the banks.' ( source ) 
5. Robin Cook, Former British Foreign Secretary 
'The truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group called Al-Qaeda, and any informed intelligence officer knows this. But, there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an intensified entity representing the 'devil' only in order to drive TV watchers to accept a unified international leadership for a war against terrorism. The country behind this propaganda is the United States.' ( source ) 
6. John F. Hylan, Mayor of New York City from 1918-1925 
'The real menace of our Republic is the invisible government, which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy legs over our cities, states and nation . . . The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the United States government for their own selfish purposes. They practically control both parties . . .

Humans Are Free Baking Soda & Coconut Oil Can Kill Cancer: Eye-Opening Evidence 
A woman diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma skin cancer located on the crown on her head managed to cure it by applying baking soda paste directly on the affected area. 
At first, when her daughter insisted, she refused, but then she decided to give it a try. After three major surgeries, the cancer returned and each time it was even worse, so she decided to trust nature and started using pure cold pressed organic coconut oil instead of water and baking soda . 
Coconut oil has cellular regenerative powers, which is why she applied the thick paste directly onto the affected area. 
Azizo, her daguhter, used only Polysporin Triple 3 Antibiotics, and she applied them only at night. 
You are allowed to use other antibiotic ointment just as a precaution against bacterial infections within the sore area. For instance, you can use colloidal silver soaked cotton as well. 
Once the wound is closed, you can stop using the ointment. Azizo continued applying the combination of baking soda and coconut oil, but she also applied cotton ball soaked in ACV and taped it to the skin. 
As a result, this induced the penetraton of baking soda to the basal cell carcinoma roots beyond the skin's surface. Yet another even better solution for this purpose is DMSO. 
Azizo continued applying this remedy to her mother for 38 days, and finally, the woman was completely free from skin cancer and the wound healed in no time. 
You can read their story and learn more about the method she used by following this link . 
Even though this skin cancer is nor deadly as melanoma can be, it can still continue spreading on the skin if it's not properly cured. 
If you didn't know, tumors only thrive in acidic environments, which makes baking soda an excellent solution since it provides only alkaline environment. 
Dramatic Life and Death Story 
Vernon Johnson, recently divorced and low on cash was diagnosed with stage III prostate cancer, which metastasized into the hip area and soon developed in stage IV. 
He was supposed to be examined about the therapy he needed to undergo in several weeks, when his son suggested him to try several substances that could rapidly alkalize on a cellular level. 
Even though he ordered cesium, it never arrived, so he used baking soda and blackstrap mollases, instead of maple syrup. 
The Trojan Horse sugar should open cancer cells wide so that they could receive the highly alkaline influence of baking soda. This should eventually result in destruction of cancer cells. 
After two weeks of using this natural solution, his bone scan showed that there is no spreading of the cancer. The PSA dropped from 22 to 5 to 1 over the course of his treatment and pharmaceutical prescriptions. 
However, beside his treatment, Vernon started spending a lot of time on sunlight, switched to a healthier plant based diet and did breathing exercises on a regular basis in order to increase the oxygen delivery to the cancer affected area. 
Moreover he wrote a book called ' Vernon's Dance With Cancer: After the Jolt ', where he shared his experience with cancer. 
He wrote this book over five years after the original baking soda alkaline producing treatment. Five years later, he is cancer free and he gives lectures about the treatment. 
It should be mentioned that there are certain foods that produce alkalinity in the body, while certain acidic foods such as lemon and limes become alkaline in the body right after their ingestion. Make sure to incorporate baking soda in your life since it is alkaline and produces alkalinity. 
Dr. Mark Sircus is an Italian former physician who is now an alternative health practitioner. Based on his experience as an oncology surgeon, he injects baking soda solution into the blood vessels that feed tumors. 
According to Dr. Simoncini , there is no pharmaceutical anti-fungal that is more effective and safe than baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate. 
Moreover, he also claims that cancer thrives on fungal colonies which also create cancer. His claim resulted in removing of his physician certification in Italy. 
As you can see, baking soda is extremely powerful natural ingredient which should receive more attention and examination, or at least is should be considered as a complementary treatment for severe ailments and a total approach for minor ailments.

Ancient Origins Words from the Ancient Past: The Sogdian Ancient Letters 
The Sogdians were a people of Iranian origin who lived in the fertile valleys of Central Asia between the sixth century BC and tenth century AD. The secret to the Sogdians' success was their knack for commerce. Building cities in what is today Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, the Sogdian merchants became vital go-betweens for trade on the Silk Road. The legacy of these people is also preserved in the fragments of writings that remain with us today. Many of the documents are translations of Buddhist scriptures. More intriguingly, there are also five nearly-complete personal letters that paint a vivid picture of what life was like for the ordinary people living in a vast trade society. Sogdians on an Achaemenid Persian relief from the Apadana of Persepolis, offering tributary gifts to the Persian king Darius I, 5th century BC ( public domain ) 
The five letters were discovered in 1907 by Aurel Stein, a famous British archaeologist, in the ruins of a Chinese watchtower that guarded the city of Dunhuang (an administrative and cultural center modern-day Gansu Province). The tower stood at the western approaches of the city, which would have been an important stop on Silk Road trading routes. These letters 'are the earliest substantial examples of Sogdian writing and thus provide extremely important information about the early history of the Sogdian diaspora along the eastern end of the silk route' (Sims-Williams, 2004). Some experts theorize that the letters had been confiscated by the Chinese officials at a time when Chinese control over this region was under threat; others suggest that they were abandoned in the hasty flight of a deliveryman fleeing from the city. The letters were found outside Dunhuang, pictured ( sand and tsunamis / flickr ) 
Each letter had evidence of being folded and refolded several times; they also bore the names of the senders and intended recipients on the outside. At least two were written by people in Dunhuang. The letters are believed to have been part of a 'mailbag' traveling among the major cities of the region. Letters nos. 2 and 5 concern the commercial activity of the writers, who were most likely merchants or their representatives abroad. The author of Letter 2 lived in Jincheng (modern-day Lanzhou, also in Gansu province), a town built at the entrance to a pass between the southern mountains and the northern deserts that ultimately leads to Dunhuang, a gateway known as the Hexi Corridor. The author was a member of the Sogdian diaspora living in China; he was a representative of a wealthy Sogdian merchant in Samarkand. He wrote to the home office to relate the recent attacks by the Huns on the Chinese cities of Yeh and Luoyang. 'The last emperor, so they say, fled from Luoyang because of the famine and fire was set to his palace and to the city, and the palace was burnt and the city [destroyed]. Luoyang is no more, Yeh is no more! ['¦] And, sirs, if I were to write to you about how China has fared, it would be beyond grief: there is no profit for you to gain from it ['¦] [in] Luoyang'¦ the Indians and the Sogdians there had all died of starvation' (Sims-William quoted in VaissiÃ¨re, 2003). The letter also expresses concerns involving the distribution of some money that the author had deposited back at home.

Letter 5 originated in Guzang, located within the Hexi Corridor northwest of Luoyang. The intended recipient 'may have been resident in Khotan, an important town along the southern silk route just before it crosses the Pamir Mountains to reach the oases of Transoxania, the region between the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers' (Sims-Williams, 2004). This letter also discusses the difficult conditions wrought on China by the Huns. This author seems to be in a more perilous position than the author of Letter 2: he complains that his commercial partner has just abandoned him.

Letters 1 and 3 are of a different nature. They were written by a woman named Mewnai ('tiger cub') whose husband Nanaidat ('created by the goddess Nanai') had abandoned her in Dunhuang. The first letter is addressed to Mewnai's mother, Catis; the third letter is addressed to Nanaidat and written on behalf of Mewnai and Nanidat's daughter, Sen. Both letters describe how Mewnai and Sen have been living in Dunhuang for over 3 years without any word from Nanaidat. As they have run out of clothes and money, Mewnai begs to be allowed to return to her parents' home. However, the closest relative of her husband, a man named Farnxund, is refusing to let them leave. Mewnai writes that a priest has offered to provide the mother and daughter with a camel and escort; he implores Mewnai to go home. In the first letter, Mewnai asks her mother if it is okay to agree to the priest's offer. In the other letter, Mewnai and Sen say that if Nanaidat does not speak up soon, they will be sold by Fernxund into the servitude of the Chinese. There is a good chance Nanaidat died while out on the dangerous trade roads. In any case, there is no evidence of what ever happened to this small Sogdian family.

Much of what is known about the Sogdians comes from Chinese chronicles in which the phrases 'inland Silk Road' and 'Sogdian trading network' are all but synonymous. Other references to the people come from Greek, Indian, Arabic, Byzantine, and Armenian sources. The renowned traders sold musk, silver goods, silk, and slaves. Sogdian city-states, such as Samarkand and Bukhara, were cosmopolitan urban centers of culture but were never very powerful.

Posted on October 26, 2016 by Charles Hugh Smith 
Once dissed as The Dark Ages, the Medieval Era is more properly viewed as a successful adaptation to the challenges of the post-Western Roman Empire era. The decline of the Western Roman Empire was the result of a constellation of challenges, including (but not limited to) massive new incursions of powerful Germanic tribes, a widening chasm between the Western and the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium), plague, an onerous tax burden on the non-elite classes, weak leadership, the dominance of a self-serving elite (sound familiar?) and last but not least, the expansion of an unproductive rabble in Rome that had to be bribed with increasingly costly Bread and Circuses . 
In effect, The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire ran out of time and money. The Grand Strategy, successful for hundreds of years, relied heavily on persuading 'barbarian' tribes to join the Roman system for the commercial and security benefits. This process of integration worked because it was backed by the threat of destruction by military force. 
The Empire maintained relatively modest military forces given its vast territory, but its road system and fleet enabled relatively rapid concentration of force to counter an invasion. It also maintained extensive fortifications along active borders. 
All of this required substantial tax revenues, manpower and effective leadership, not just for fortifications, the army, roads and the fleet, but to maintain the commercial and political benefits offered to 'barbarians' who chose integration in the Empire. 
Once the military threats proliferated and the benefits of Imperial membership eroded, the Grand Strategy was unable to maintain the integrity of the Imperial borders. 
As tax revenues and the bureaucracy they supported imploded, security declined, reducing trade and communications. This unvirtuous cycle fed on itself: reduced trade led to reduced tax revenues which led to phantom legions that were still listed on the bureaucratic ledgers but which no longer had any troops. 
The collapse of the Western Empire was a process, not an event. Key organizational infrastructures that endured through the Medieval era'for example, the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian Churches'gained traction in the waning centuries of the Western Empire. 
Monasteries offered islands of scholarship and literacy and in many cases offered security via fortifications. 
As trade diminished along with secure trade routes, self-reliance became the order of the day outside the borders of the Byzantine and Persian empires. 
Though political leadership shifted with the latest invasion from the steppes of Eurasia, the two branches of Christendom slowly converted many invading groups or consolidated existing Christian powers into alliances that bound together diverse groups and proto-states. 
These alliances were typically contingent and temporary, as today's ally became tomorrow's enemy, or vice versa. Despite the shifting loyalties of constant invasion and warfare, the Byzantine Empire endured and Charlemagne (and others) in Western Europe established the fractured but still effective Holy Roman Empire. 
Much was lost when the Western Roman Empire collapsed, but islands of literacy, learning and security arose despite the constant conflicts and threats of invasion. Venice offers one example of a small city securing trade routes with commercial centers that then funded a regional empire. 
The tidiness of the old Empire could not be reinstated. The adaptations were as messy and untidy as the challenges that swept in from the steppes and forests. 
So please don't diss the Dark Ages. Yes, the Roman baths, coliseums and political /social order fell into disrepair, but new ways of coping emerged that were as contingent and untidy as the era's multiple challenges. 
New modes of production and new social /political orders do not arise fully formed. They are pieced together by trial and error and numerous cycles of adaptation, innovation and failure. Share:

5 Reasons Why Belief in Authority is the Most Dangerous Superstition Belief in authority is dangerous, and doubly so when the majority is under its spell. 
'Question authority, including the authority that told you to question authority.' ' Sixth grade girl 
Let's get something straight, here at the outset. There's nothing wrong with authority itself. It's the belief part that messes everything up. Anyone can claim authority. But such authority only matters if others believe in it. 
I can claim that I'm an authority on unicorns, but I better have the credentials to prove it. And it would also help if unicorns existed. But the point is this: If enough people 'believe' that I'm an authority on unicorns, and they 'believe' that I have dissected a unicorn and revealed the magical quality of its insides that causes it to shit rainbows, then I'll not only have violated truth, I'll have violated the minds of others and taken advantage of their ignorance. But, and here's the rub, it's their fault for not questioning my so-called authority. As Albert Einstein said (himself an authority in the field of physics), 'Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.' So if we're correct to question Einstein's revolutionary theories, then we're exponentially correct to question my unicorn theories. 
Respecting a prestigious authority, or taking into consideration important knowledge gleaned by someone who is an authority in a particular domain of knowledge is fine. It's even okay that sometimes we allow people to violate our minds. We allow artists to do it all the time. No, it's when we 'believe' in authority, when we blindly follow a perceived authority, that things go wrong. 
Belief implies non-questioning. But let's sail right past semantics and art and get down to brass tacks. Belief in authority is dangerous. And it's doubly dangerous when the majority of people are under its spell. Here are five reasons why. 1.) It Can Cause Otherwise Good People to do Evil Things 
'It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled.' 
MARK TWAIN 
So back to my authority on unicorns. Did you know that unicorns also created the universe? Yup! Not only do they shit rainbows, they also puke universes. The last unicorn died for our sins in a forest of fiery crosses. And the only commandment that survived the test of time is this: 'Anyone who questions the fact that unicorns created the universe are godless heathens and deserve to die and spend eternity in the fiery pits of a Tennessee summer afternoon.' 
Now enter unquestioning idiots with hooked-on-authority soup for brains. They 'believe' the Last Commandment of the Unicorns. They believe it so much that they refuse to question it, lest other believers think they are not true believers. Lest they get ostracized by the status quo. Lest they look 'crazy' in the eyes of their fellow believers. Now just replace The Last Commandment of the Unicorns with the Bible or the Koran or the Constitution of the United States, or state-driven police enforcement , or the belief that 'nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.' 
The problem is that people will fight, and kill, and murder, and commit both genocide and ecocide, for what they believe in. But they might not have fought so violently and thoughtlessly had they simply taken into consideration ALL those claims of authority and moved on smartly with their lives. The best way to maintain a healthy skepticism, and not devolve into an ignorant, sycophantic, violent mess, is to take things into consideration and question them rather than believe in them. 2.) It Leads to the Idea That We Need to Give a Group of People Permission to Control Us 
'The multitudes have a tendency to accept whoever is master. Their very mass weighs them down with apathy. A mob easily adds up to obedience. You have to stir them up, push them, treat the men rough using the very advantage of their deliverance, hurt their eyes with the truth, throw light at them in terrible handfuls.' 
VICTOR HUGO 
By the way, the Church of the Last Unicorn is in charge of everything. It is the power behind all nation states. It pulls the strings of presidents. It whispers dark secret nothings into the ears of queens. It tugs the coattails of emperors. Its poison-soft invisible rainbow-powers saturate all things. You might as well just give into it. You might as well just let them pull your strings through the indirect authority of strategically placed men. It's just the way things are, after all. 
Or, you could question it all. You could question the almighty Unicorns. You could question the kings and queens and emperors and presidents and judges and lawyers and cops. You could question all authority, especially the so called authority of the state . It's so easy even a sixth grader understands it (see opening quote). 
The alternative is devolving into a statist. A statist is a person who believes that a group of people have the right to force, coerce, enslave, rob, and murder others. Statism is a mental disorder brought on by years of indoctrination. The problem is that the majority of the world's population has been conditioned and brainwashed into believing in the almighty power of the state. The problem is that the majority of people are too afraid to question the state, lest they become ostracized by the statist-junky status quo. The problem is that most people don't even know that they don't know that there is an alternativ e. 3.) Power Given to Authority Tends to Corrupt 
'I have as much authority as the Pope. I just don't have as many people who believe it.' 
GEORGE CARLIN 
Here's a little secret: The Pope has unicorn powers. Then again, so does Colin Kaepernick . Keep in mind, the unicorn power is a righteous power. It's a loving power that had, and has, the greatest of intentions. It created the universe, after all. And if you don't believe it, then feel free to rot in Hades, Illinois, located directly across the Mississippi River from St. Louis (according to Uncyclopedia: the content-free encyclopedia ). 
But I digress, the problem with power isn't its intent. The problem with power is that it tends to corrupt the one wielding it. And when it comes to absolute power 'well, we all know where that leads. So since we all know that power tends to corrupt, and since we all want power anyway, it behooves us all to be circumspect both with it and against it. 
So it stands to reason not to give power to authority by believing it, but to use the power of authority instead by undermining it. And the best way to use the power of authority is to use it against the authority by questioning that authority. It's a social leveling mechanism par excellence, similar to the Native American concept of counting coup. As Elie Weisel said, 'Every question possesses a power that does not lie within the answer.' We just need to use that power more effectively, especially against ourselves. Unicorns forbid! 4.) It Leads to An Ignorant and Apathetic Citizenry 
'The totally convinced and the totally stupid have too much in common for the resemblance to be accidental.' 
ROBERT ANTON WILSON 
In the Unicorns we trust! Their powers are ubiquitous. Their symbols of control are hidden in all the world's national flags, waiving influentially over the weakened masses. Their horns are the invisible bone funnels in everyone's pie, siphoning power like it was blood pudding. Oh, I forgot to mention, blood pudding is a unicorn's favorite dish. Obey, or go without! 
When it comes down to it, obedience to authority is a disease of laziness and indifference. It hinders the progressive evolution of our species by undermining anything that might challenge the current system for the better. Forget 'for the worst.' Fighting for the better at risk of the worst is far superior to shirking the better in fear of the worst. Similarly, worst case scenarios should not be avoided at the expense of healthy progress. Healthy progress should be embraced at the risk of worst case scenarios. Otherwise we don't get anywhere but where we are. Which is great if 'where we are' is perfect. But since perfection is not possible, we must be willing to risk upsetting the all-too-precious apple cart (or blood pudding cart, in this case) in order to progress. 
If, as Jose Ortega y Gasset said, 'Man, whether he likes it or not, is a being forced by his nature to seek some higher authority. If he succeeds in finding it of himself then he is a superior man; if not, he is a mass-man and must receive it from his superiors,' then it is incumbent upon us to have the courage to shirk our inner mass-man in order to discover self-authority through self-questioning. As long as we are responsible with our own power, and as long as we don't allow anyone to hold too much power over us, then we might just be able to get out of our own way as a species. 
Because, as it stands now, we are definitely in our own way. Especially since following authority in today's world means giving into debt-slavery , kowtowing to an expropriating state, and being unwitting accomplices to genocides past and ecocides future. As the authors of The Fuck-it Point surmised,'Obedience to authority is not a valid excuse; not when doing what we're 'supposed to do' means letting this civilization-machine continue to kill life on earth just to make commodities out of living beings and life easy only for some.'

Phys.org Mon, 24 Oct 2016 All the known major bacterial groups are represented by wedges in this circular 'tree of life.' The bigger wedges are more diverse groups. Green wedges are groups that have not been genomically sampled at the Rifle site 'everything else has. Black wedges are previously identified bacteria groups that have also been found at Rifle. Purple wedges are groups discovered at Rifle and announced last year. Red wedges are new groups discovered in this study. Colored dots represent important metabolic processes the new groups help mediate. 
One of the most detailed genomic studies of any ecosystem to date has revealed an underground world of stunning microbial diversity, and added dozens of new branches to the tree of life. 
The bacterial bonanza comes from scientists who reconstructed the genomes of more than 2,500 microbes from sediment and groundwater samples collected at an aquifer in Colorado. The effort was led by researchers from the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley. DNA sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute, a DOE Office of Science User Facility. 
As reported online October 24 in the journal Nature Communications , the scientists netted genomes from 80 percent of all known bacterial phyla, a remarkable degree of biological diversity at one location. They also discovered 47 new phylum-level bacterial groups , naming many of them after influential microbiologists and other scientists. And they learned new insights about how microbial communities work together to drive processes that are critical to the planet's climate and life everywhere, such as the carbon and nitrogen cycles. 
These findings shed light on one of Earth's most important and least understood realms of life. The subterranean world hosts up to one-fifth of all biomass, but it remains a mystery. 
'We didn't expect to find this incredible microbial diversity. But then again, we know little about the roles of subsurface microbes in biogeochemical processes, and more broadly, we don't really know what's down there,' says Jill Banfield, a Senior Faculty Scientist in Berkeley Lab's Climate & Ecosystem Sciences Division and a UC Berkeley professor in the departments of Earth and Planetary Science, and Environmental Science, Policy, and Management. 
UC Berkeley's Karthik Anantharaman, the first author of the paper, adds, 'To better understand what subsurface microbes are up to, our approach is to access their entire genomes. This enabled us to discover a greater interdependency among microbes than we've seen before.' 
The research is part of a Berkeley Lab-led project called Sustainable Systems Scientific Focus Area 2.0, which is developing a predictive understanding of terrestrial environments from the genome to the watershed scale. The project's field research takes place at a research site near the town of Rifle, Colorado, where for the past several years scientists have conducted experiments designed to stimulate populations of subterranean microbes that are naturally present in very low numbers. 
The scientists sent soil and water samples from these experiments to the Joint Genome Institute for terabase-scale metagenomic sequencing. This high-throughput method isolates and purifies DNA from environmental samples, and then sequences one trillion base pairs of DNA at a time. Next, the scientists used bioinformatics tools developed in Banfield's lab to analyze the data. 
Their approach has redrawn the tree of life. Between the 47 new bacterial groups reported in this work, and 35 new groups published last year (also found at the Rifle site), Banfield's team has doubled the number of known bacterial groups. 
With discovery comes naming rights. The scientists named many of the new bacteria groups after Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley researchers. For example, there's Candidatus Andersenbacteria, after phylochip inventor Gary Andersen, and there's Candidatus Doudnabacteria, after CRISPR genome-editing pioneer Jennifer Doudna. 'Berkeley now dominates the tree of life as it does the periodic table,' Banfield says, in a nod to the sixteen elements discovered at Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley. 
Another big outcome is a deeper understanding of the roles subsurface microbes play in globally important carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles . This information will help to better represent these cycles in predictive models such as climate simulations. 
The scientists conducted metabolic analyses of 36 percent of the organisms detected in the aquifer system. They focused on a phenomenon called metabolic handoff, which essentially means one microbe's waste is another microbe's food. It's known from lab studies that handoffs are needed in certain reactions, but these interconnected networks are widespread and vastly more complex in the real world. 
To understand why it's important to represent metabolic handoffs as accurately as possible in models, consider nitrate, a groundwater contaminant from fertilizers. Subsurface microbes are the primary driver in reducing nitrate to harmless nitrogen gas. There are four steps in this denitrification process, and the third step creates nitrous oxide'one of the most potent greenhouse gases. The process breaks down if microbes that carry out the fourth step are inactive when a pulse of nitrate enters the system. 
'If microbes aren't there to accept the nitrous oxide handoff, then the greenhouse gas escapes into the atmosphere,' says Anantharaman. 
The scientists found the carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles are all driven by metabolic handoffs that require an unexpectedly high degree of interdependence among microbes. The vast majority of microorganisms can't fully reduce a compound on their own. It takes a team. There are also backup microbes ready to perform a handoff if first-string microbes are unavailable. 
'The combination of high microbial diversity and interconnections through metabolic handoffs likely results in high ecosystem resilience ,' says Banfield.

A remarkable 7,000-year-old megalithic site that served as an astronomical observatory has been found in Muduma village in Telangana, India. The discovery has been hailed as one of the most significant archaeological findings in India over the last few decades. 
According to Times of India , the team of archeologists described it as 'the only megalithic site in India, where a depiction of a star constellation has been identified'. The ancient observatory dates to 5,000 BC and the researchers believe that it is the earliest astronomical observatory discovered in India and perhaps even in the whole of South Asia. 
The site consists of around 80 huge menhirs (standing stones), which are 3.5 ' 4 meters tall. There are also about 2000 alignment stones, which are 30-60cm tall. According to experts, no other excavation site in India has so many menhirs concentrated in such a small area. The maximum concentration of menhirs is located in the central portion of the monument.

One of the surprising details discovered at the site is a depiction of the constellation known as Ursa Major, which is formed from small cup-sized pits carved into a standing stone. The group of about 30 cup-marks were arranged in the same shape in which Ursa Major can be observed in the night sky with the naked eye. The carving depicts not only the prominent seven starts, but also the peripheral stars too. 
Moreover, as ArcheoFeed.com reported: an 'imaginary line drawn through the top two stars point to pole star or the North Star'. 
Researchers believe that the site still holds many secrets. The next planned research will take a place in December led by archeologists from Korea. The constellation Ursa Major as it can be seen by the unaided eye ( public domain ) 
Numerous prehistoric observatories have already been discovered around the world, including Peru, Britain and Armenia. Thousands of years ago people were trying to understand the sky and were often using their observations to make predictions for agricultural and ceremonial purposes. The site Zorats Karer from Armenia dates back to the same period as the observatory from India. As Natalia Klimczak from Ancient Origins wrote : 
'Zorats Karer is also known as Carahunge, Karahunj, Qarahunj. It is located in an area of around 7 hectares and covers the site nearby the Dar river canyon, close to the city of Sisan. The ancient site is often called the 'Armenian Stonehenge', but the truth of what it is may be even more fascinating. According to researchers, Zorats Karer could be among the world's oldest astronomical observatories, and is at least 3,500 years older than British Stonehenge. The site was rediscovered in 1984 by a team led by researcher Onik Khnkikyan. After a few months of work, Khnkikyan concluded that the site of Zorats Karer must have been an observatory. Moreover, with time, Armenian archeologists, astronomers and astrophysicists found that there were at least two other ancient sites important for prehistoric astronomy in the vicinity: Angeghakot and Metzamor.

In 1994, Zorats Karer was extensively analyzed by Professor Paris Herouni, a member of the Armenian National Academy of Science and President of the Radio Physics Research Institute in Yerevan. His expeditions revealed a great deal of fascinating information about the site. First of all, his team counted 223 stones, of which 84 were found to have holes. They measured the longitude, latitude and the magnetic deviation of the site. The researchers also created a topographical map of the monumental megalithic construction, which became the basis of further work. Finally, the main treasure of the site was unearthed ' a collection of many impressive and unique astronomical objects. The researchers realized that several stones were used to make observations of the sun, moon and stars. They were located according to knowledge about the rising, culmination moments, and setting of the sun, moon and specific stars. The stones are basalt, somewhat protected by moss but smoothed by the rain and wind and full of holes and erosion. Many of the stones were damaged over time. 
In ancient times, the stones were shaped and arranged in what are known as the north and south arms, the central circle, the north-eastern alley, the separate standing system of circles and the chord. The stones are between 0.5 and 3 meters tall and weigh up to 10 tons. Some of them are related to burial cists.'

Your News Wire WikiLeaks Bombshell: 'There Is No US Election' The whistleblowing organization also released Barack Obama's personal emails, showing that President Bush organized his transition to the highest office in the land before the 2008 election. Posted on October 21, 2016 by Baxter Dmitry WikiLeaks couldn't have made it clearer in a series of tweets on Thursday ' the US election for the President of the United States is rigged. The establishment have selected their President and by hook or crook she will be 'elected.' 
Responding to allegations that WikiLeaks recent leaks have outed it as playing partisan politics, WikiLeaks fired back , ' You are not a fan of publishing true information about corrupt ruling power factions who will take power on Jan 20? ' 
On the day WikiLeaks publicized the release of emails from Barack Obama's personal account, their Twitter account then stated that the outcome of the election was planned from the outset: ' What election? It has been clear from the beginning who is going to win. This is, in effect, a power consolidation exercise .' 
Considering what we now know about the behind-the-scenes rigging of the Democratic primary, the collusion between the DNC establishment and mainstream media, and the fact Hillary Clinton pushed for Donald Trump's GOP nomination, can you possibly disagree? 
Are Presidents elected or selected? 
WikiLeaks emails from Barack Obama's personal email account reveal that the Bush administration contacted the future president multiple times before the election, secretly organizing the transition of power. 
The 2008 transition had gone down in history as surprisingly smooth. Martha Joynt Kumar, in a book about the transition, said it ' was the best in anyone's memory, in part because 9/11 made everyone recognize that a transition is fragile time .' 
Today's revelations raise questions about why it was so smooth ' suggestions Obama was selected by the shadow government, rather than elected by the people, are no longer tinfoil hat territory. 
The most eye catching email in today's leak contains a message from John Podesta about an invitation from President George W. Bush to the 'President-Elect.' 
Should that have read 'President-Select?' Podesta sent the email to Obama before the election result was known. 
But it gets even worse. 
The emails show a transition plan was being worked on long before the 2008 election had taken place. According to an attached memo in one of the emails, Obama was already discussing his transition to office with members of the Bush Administration, including then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, prior to the election. 
' As you have observed in your interactions with Secretary Paulson, he is apparently eager to involve you and your transition team extensively in his policy choices following the election. ' Are Presidents elected or selected? 
Another attached memo acknowledges that it was unusual to start the transition process so soon. 
' We are now at the point of deciding how to staff economic policy during the transition, who should be the point of contact with Treasury and how to blend the transition and campaign economic policy talent. 
Normally these decisions could be made after the election, and ideally after the selection of a National Economic Advisor, but, of course, these are not normal times. ' 
Not normal times? Perhaps not in 2008. But eight years later, it seems nothing has changed. What was 'not normal' in 2008 has become very much the norm in 2016. 
Thanks to WikiLeaks and the unprecedented peek behind the curtains of power they have granted us, the shadow government has been exposed to the light. 2008 wasn't a smooth transition of power, it was silky smooth power consolidation. 
WikiLeaks' variety of journalism ' cold, hard, pristine truth ' has more than ruffled feathers. The entire henhouse has gone mad. The ruling party are slavering at the mouth, and mainstream media has never been so easy to see through. 
Watch CNN's Scott Cuomo , the same guy caught lying to Americans about their First Amendment rights, put himself in the running for a Razzie Award after the network pulled an interview with Rep. Chris Collins as soon as he mentioned WikiLeaks.

World Socialist Web Site 
AT&T, the telecommunications and cable TV colossus, announced Saturday that it has struck a deal to acquire the pay TV and entertainment giant Time Warner. The merger, if approved by the Justice Department and US regulatory agencies under the next administration, will create a corporate entity with unprecedented control over both the distribution and content of news and entertainment. It will also mark an even more direct integration of the media and the telecomm industry with the state. 
AT&T, the largest US telecom group by market value, already controls huge segments of the telephone, pay-TV and wireless markets. Its $48.5 billion purchase of the satellite provider DirecTV last year made it the biggest pay-TV provider in the country, ahead of Comcast. It is the second-largest wireless provider, behind Verizon. 
Time Warner is the parent company of such cable TV staples as HBO, Cinemax, CNN and the other Turner System channels: TBS, TNT and Turner Sports. It also owns the Warner Brothers film and TV studio. 
The Washington Post on Sunday characterized the deal as a 'seismic shift' in the 'media and technology world,' one that 'could turn the legacy carrier [AT&T] into a media titan the likes of which the United States has never seen.' The newspaper cited Craig Moffett, an industry analyst at Moffett-Nathanson, as saying there was no precedent for a telecom company the size of AT&T seeking to acquire a content company such as Time Warner. 
'A [telecom company] owning content is something that was expressly prohibited for a century' by the government, Moffett told the Post . 
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, in keeping with his anti-establishment pose, said Saturday that the merger would lead to 'too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,' and that, if elected, he would block it. 
The Clinton campaign declined to comment on Saturday. Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Kaine, speaking on the NBC News program 'Meet the Press' on Sunday, said he had 'concerns' about the merger, but he declined to take a clear position, saying he had not seen the details. 
AT&T, like the other major telecom and Internet companies, has collaborated with the National Security Agency (NSA) in its blanket, illegal surveillance of telephone and electronic communications. NSA documents released last year by Edward Snowden show that AT&T has played a particularly reactionary role. 
As the New York Times put it in an August 15, 2015 article reporting the Snowden leaks: 'The National Security Agency's ability to spy on vast quantities of Internet traffic passing through the United States has relied on its extraordinary, decades-long partnership with a single company: the telecom giant AT&T.' 
The article went on to cite an NSA document describing the relationship between AT&T and the spy agency as 'highly collaborative,' and quoted other documents praising the company's 'extreme willingness to help' and calling their mutual dealings 'a partnership, not a contractual relationship.' 
The Times noted that AT&T installed surveillance equipment in at least 17 of its Internet hubs based in the US, provided technical assistance enabling the NSA to wiretap all Internet communications at the United Nations headquarters, a client of AT&T, and gave the NSA access to billions of emails. 
If the merger goes through, this quasi-state entity will be in a position to directly control the content of much of the news and entertainment accessed by the public via television, the movies and smart phones. The announcement of the merger agreement is itself an intensification of a process of telecom and media convergence and consolidation that has been underway for years, and has accelerated under the Obama administration. 
In 2009, the cable provider Comcast announced its acquisition for $30 billion of the entertainment conglomerate NBCUniversal, which owns both the National Broadcasting Company network and Universal Studios. The Obama Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission ultimately approved the merger. 
Other recent mergers involving telecoms and content producers include, in addition to AT&T's 2015 purchase of DirecTV: Verizon Communications' acquisition of the Huffington Post , Yahoo and AOL; Lionsgate's deal to buy the pay-TV channel Starz; Verizon's agreement announced in the spring to buy DreamWorks Animation; and Charter Communications' acquisition of the cable provider Time Warner Cable, approved this year. 
The AT&T-Time Warner announcement will itself trigger a further restructuring and consolidation of the industry, as rival corporate giants scramble to compete within a changing environment that has seen the growth of digital and streaming companies such as Netflix and Hulu at the expense of the traditional cable and satellite providers. 
The Financial Times wrote on Saturday that 'the mooted deal could fire the starting gun on a round of media and technology consolidation.' Referring to a new series of mergers and acquisitions, the Wall Street Journal on Sunday quoted a 'top media executive' as saying that an AT&T-Time Warner deal would 'certainly kick off the dance.' 
The scale of the buyout agreed unanimously by the boards of both companies is massive. AT&T is to pay Time Warner a reported $85.4 billion in cash and stocks, at a price of $107.50 per Time Warner share. This is significantly higher than the current market price of Time Warner shares, which rose 8 percent to more than $89 Friday on rumors of the merger deal. 
In addition, AT&T is to take on Time Warner's debt, pushing the actual cost of the deal to more than $107 billion. The merged company would have a total debt of $150 billion, making inevitable a campaign of cost-cutting and job reduction. 
The unprecedented degree of monopolization of the telecom and media industries is the outcome of the policy of deregulation, launched in the late 1970s by the Democratic Carter administration and intensified by every administration, Republican or Democratic, since then. In 1982, the original AT&T, colloquially known as 'Ma Bell,' was broken up into seven separate and competing regional 'Baby Bell' companies. 
This was sold to the public as a means of ending the tightly regulated AT&T monopoly over telephone service and unleashing the 'competitive forces' of the market, where increased competition would supposedly lower consumer prices and improve service. What ensued was a protracted process of mergers and disinvestments involving the destruction of hundreds of thousands of jobs, which drove up stock prices at the expense of both employees and the consuming public. 
Dallas-based Southwestern Bell was among the most aggressive of the 'Baby Bells' in expanding by means of acquisitions and ruthless cost-cutting, eventually evolving into the new AT&T. Now, the outcome of deregulation has revealed itself to be a degree of monopolization and concentrated economic power beyond anything previously seen.

Kevin Annett reviews the past few years of the ITCCS | Oct. 15th 2016 
Published on Oct 20, 2016 In this interview with Ella Ster Kevin Annett reviews the work of the ITCCS in the past years and in particular the year 2014. This was an important year for the ITCCS (International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State), as the organisation got more and more momentum and started to reveal serious crimes committed by the Vatican, European royals and political leaders. Kevin reflects on the break with Alfred Webre who completely distanced himself from the ITCCS and it's work. 
As a result the initial momentum seemed to have stagnated, although behind the scenes the investigations into the crimes committed by religious leaders and heads of state continued. In order to pick up the pieces we look back at some of the dossiers and witness statements that were revealed at that time and in particular in regards to the revelations involving the Dutch and Belgium royals and Dutch political top. We discuss specific details that were brought up by the Dutch witnesses Toos Nijenhuis and Anne Marie van Blijenburgh in 2013-2014. The latter testified about torture parties and human hunting parties that involved children as prey, ordered by and paid for by the former Dutch Queen Beatrix, organised by her previous husband Kees van Korlaar, and attended by the Dutch political establishment, including the present Prime Minister Mark Rutte. 
We also talk about the dark forces behind ritual abuse and why Kevin likes to focus on the human aspect of things. Apart from restoring justice, the work of the ITCCS also involves creating awareness and inspire people to reclaim their own power. In order to end the energy transfer that does not only take place during ritual abuse, but also in other areas of society, people need to realize that the authority lies within themselves.

By John Bart Gerald Global Research, October 26, 2016 
On his return from attempting to stop the terrible slaughter of Rwandans there was no official to welcome home Canada's General Romeo Dallaire. In his recent memoir, Waiting For First Light: My Ongoing Battle with PTSD , (1) Dallaire reveals that his return also began a pattern of suicide attempts, blamed on ptsd, perhaps survivor's guilt, but which these years later might be traced more accurately to his reluctance to understand that the people who sent him to Rwanda did not care for humanity. 
Dallaire, a protector, continues to affirm Canada's adherence to a code of genocide prevention, on paper, and as a Senior Fellow contributes to the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies. It is the major Genocide prevention NGO in Canada, but noted for coincidences of policy with those of the U.S. State Department and Canadian foreign service. Any MIGS project concerned with the genocide of U.S. or Canadian Aboriginal peoples, or of Palestinians is hard to find. Our society's intransigence of not caring, hardens. 
Currently it's not even helpful to discuss a relationship between the U.S. and the Convention on Genocide since U.S. foreign policies lack moral compass. Having withdrawn from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the U.S. avoids charges of genocide as long as it has the military power to do so. With less military power, Canada subscribing to the Court, needs moral and political power to maintain its borders. Of necessity, diplomacy has meaning. Canada ratified the Convention on Genocide in 1952, (2) a generation before the U.S. which waited until 1988. 
Several current news items lead to the same point of focus: Canada's evasion of its responsibility to honour and adhere to the Convention on Genocide. Its unfaithfulness encourages states of emergency to play out through Indigenous communities in Canada. It's also evident in foreign policies against more distant peoples. As though the Convention on Genocide were not primary law, had no statute of limitations, has no affect beyond the good will and salaried hopes of NGO's, and no application to first world countries. 
Canadian Mining Companies 
From Toronto the Justice and Accountability Project has just issued a report on the responsibility of Canadian Mining companies for one level of violence in Latin America. The 'Canada Brand': Violence and Canadian Mining Companies in Latin America, (3) documents 44 deaths and 403 injuries in the years 2000 to 2015, all involving Canadian Companies in Latin America, and declares this is the tip of an iceberg. It classifies the majority of the victims as 'targeted.' 
While the report includes cases of criminalization it doesn't include reports of deaths and injuries which aren't verified by two independent sources and it doesn't include 'death threats, deliberate burning of crops and property destruction, forced displacement, reported assassination attempts without reported injury, illness from environmental contamination, or psychological trauma from any of the violence'¦' (4) or countries in other regions such as in Canada or Africa. This is 15 years of violence against native protectors of the land without bringing to bear the effects of the mining companies on entire communities and their habitats: to put the two together places the mining companies within a perspective of the U.N . Convention on Genocide. The murder of activist protectors suggests the element of 'intention' considered by U.S. interpretation necessary to prosecution of genocide charges. 
In Muskrat Falls Labrador, on October 23rd, 150 protesters entered the Crown corporation Nalcor's construction site to protest the company's reluctance to thoroughly clear vegetation and some topsoil from the land it's about to flood. Uncut vegetation as well as topsoil are considered factors in the increase of methylmercury poisoning of the watershed. Nalcor workers are being evacuated from the camp, turning their quarters over to the protesters. The RCMP is blocking roads to discourage reinforcement to the protesters. Pam Palmater, a respected lawyer and Mi'kmaq teaching as an Associate Professor in Toronto, sees the company's carelessness in risking the environment to poison as part of the ongoing industrial genocide of native peoples. (5) It's a concern which increasingly covers settlers, immigrants, as both Indigenous and 'settler'groups are equally deprived of power under law. Mayors of four nearby towns affected by the flooding say Nalcor consistently ignores them and they've been excluded from the talks between the company and Indigenous groups. 
First Nations 
In northern Saskatchewan so far in October four indigenous children ' girls of from ten to fourteen years of age, took their own lives. This is part of an ongoing suicide epidemic in first Nations communities of the north where the suicide rate is five times the norm for Canada. The government is responding by increasing the number of mental health care workers available. This misses the point of the children's final acts. As a group they're refusing life on the terms that Canada offers. Suicide rates among northern Indigenous people are a result of social engineering by Canada's dominant culture, either through its lack of concern or by intention. It continues the colonial genocide of subjugation. What could stop the native society's slide into hopelessness is honouring the society's basic needs of housing, water, food. This is not beyond the power and convenience of Canadian and Provincial governments. It seems beyond the business game plans of resource corporations and a European mindset of superiority which permeates all areas of Canadian society. 
A recent article in the Canadian Medical Association Journal reveals that the children of Nunavut have the highest respiratory infection rates in the world, and accuses the Nunavut government of covering up respiratory disease (respiratory syncytial virus / RSV) infections, which according to statistics from 2009 (why aren't these statistics current?) hospitalized 40% of the children in Western Nunavut. The dosage of pharmaceuticals for treatment costs about $6500 / patient. (6) And children often have to be flown to hospital. Emergency funds go to pharmaceutical companies and airlines rather than the community and improving the living conditions and poor nutrition which cause the disease rate. The cycle of poverty and relief profits big business, as maintained by government budgeting. 
All of these areas converge in a consideration of genocide but to mention the word 'genocide' is a snare. While university courses and human rights NGOs raise the issue of genocide again and again as a thorn in the side of Canada's self-image ' the nuts and bolts of legally applying the Convention under Canadian law are so carefully controlled that the term has no meaning except in the service of a European exploitative class. 
Application of the U.N.'s Convention on Genocide, which has teeth within Canadian law (7) requires permission of Canada's Minister of Justice. (8) Canada's Minister of Justice is a political appointment by the nation's Prime Minister. Therefore practically, it isn't likely the Prime Minister would ever be charged with genocide, nor will his political allies, nor the visiting leaders of allied countries, which gives all of them a certain amount of freedom from worry. And under the code of one dominant ruling elite, protection is assured subsequent government administrations and Ministers of Justice, as long as a group remains to subjugate. The same provision of requiring Ministerial approval applies to the prosecution of any crimes against humanity. (9) 
Writing about this for some years, I've seen no challenge to this facet of Canadian law which obviously protects the establishment's governance from prosecution for one of the worst crimes known to humankind. My belief is that Canada could survive honest and direct application of the Convention on Genocide to its policies, but won't be able to if it delays in correcting root causes of disproportionate Aboriginal death and disease. 
This loophole protecting politicians who further genocide lends impunity to the policies of NATO countries in their assaults on the peoples of Afghanistan, Libya, the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Syria, where militarily applied policies have involved what I think was/is genocide. The U.S., British, French policies find the democratically elected country heads guilty of crimes then bomb the peoples into subservience and fealty to NATO. It is clearly genocide against a national group, again and again. 
The media of our NATO countries have formed a reality for our peoples which doesn't recognize the criminality of NATO country foreign policies. In North America the governments' impunity in oppressing First Peoples, Blacks and all the poor, while claiming to save them, provides a third rail carrying the power to knock out any resistance to the terrible crimes of foreign policy necessary to corporate resource extraction with high profits. 
The impunity is acceded to by a professional class where the judicial system is so expensive, the lawyers so strictly controlled, the laws so favourable to capital, that there is no effective protest of obvious injustices. Where the mental health industry accepts as norm the murder of foreign civilian populations. Where the economic machinery empowered by security and surveillance would refuse existence to those who question, protest, and struggle effectively. Where the security industry believes in the fears created to further its expansion. Where education becomes naked training of skill sets for serving oppressive corporations. Where artists and writers are rewarded for saying nothing. 
The situation of all young people gradually becomes near that of a Saskatchewan Indigenous girl. First Peoples precede us. If government maintains its refusal to protect Indigenous peoples with the primary human rights laws, then peoples of settler stock will, when convenient to power, find themselves without as well. We have to affirm and apply the protections of the Genocide Convention, for others, or we lose that protection for ourselves.

Alternative News Project CDC SPIDER is the biggest medical whistleblower event in history 
The CDC SPIDER bites! CDC Whistleblowers Team Up and Demand 'House Cleaning' and Lend Credence to Increasingly Critical Views of Authority Structures 
While the mainstream media and medical/Big Pharma spokespeople were doing their best to ignore the raging conflagration that is the VAXXED phenomenon and pretend it isn't happening, another major blow was just struck against the entrenched liars in politics claiming across-the-board 'safety' and 'zero risk' of vaccines ( see: Victorian Health Minister Jill Hennessy ). CDC whistleblower/confessor William Thompson ' the primary subject of the VAXXED documentary ' appears to have triggered somewhat of a whistleblower avalanche following his explosive confession that he and his superiors literally binned (yes, threw in the trash) hard evidence linking vaccines to autism, thus vindicating the work of numerous scientists around the world who have detected such causal connections. 
This most recent blow against such malfeasance and criminal conspiracy consists of a letter addressed to Chief of Staff Carmen Villa at the CDC and signed off on by a group of at least a dozen disenchanted/fed up CDC scientists identifying themselves as SPIDER (CDC Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence and Ethics in Research). 
CDC SPIDER constitutes the biggest whistleblower event we've ever seen, bigger even than Thompson's disturbing and compelling confession of conspiracy and coverup at the highest levels. The latest bombshell reveals (read: confirms once more) that the corruption and complicity are not anomalies, but entrenched systemic problems. 
SPIDER's August 29, 2016 plaintive demand opens with this extremely revealing paragraph (emphasis added): 
We are a group of scientists at CDC that are very concerned about the current state of ethics at our agency. It appears that our mission is being influenced and shaped by outside parties and rogue interests. It seems that our mission and Congressional intent for our agency is being circumvented by some of our leaders. What concerns us most, is that it is becoming the norm and not the rare exception. Some senior management officials at CDC are clearly aware and even condone these behaviors. Others see it and turn the other way. Some staff are intimidated and pressed to do things they know are not right. We have representatives from across the agency that witness this unacceptable behavior. It occurs at all levels and in all of our respective units'¦We are asking that you do your part to help clean up this house! 
Let's decode some key phrases: 'Outside parties and rogue interests.' = Big Pharma and general corporate whores with connections to (or jobs in) these key agencies (CDC, AMA, etc.). It's well known that there is a revolving door between massive pharmaceutical corporations and government agencies, such that 'outside parties' tend to become 'internal parties' and vice versa. The governmental arena has been thoroughly infiltrated by these 'rogue interests,' to the extent that such interests control policy creation itself. ''¦becoming the norm and not the rare exception.' ' Well, let's be real: this problem became normative a long time ago. Their statement shows that ALL authoritative claims around health/medical issues/medical interventions made by authorities such as the CDC or AMA should be viewed with suspicion and investigated thoroughly instead of taken prima facie (at face value). In other words, CDC and other such government agencies lie'¦ a lot. 'Some senior management officials'¦even condone these behaviors.' ' Because they are paid handsomely to sell humanity out to the highest bidder, whether Big Pharma, Coke, or what have you. Senior management condoning this activity creates a top-down systemic problem that poisons the entire barrel, so to speak. A strained climate of pressure to 'go along to get along' ensues. The public's suspicion of such agencies is thus well justified. 'It occurs at all levels and in all of our respective units.' I.e., no part of the CDC apparatus remains untainted by this repugnant corruption ( See: William Thompson's confession ). It is all-pervasive and, frankly, we have no reason at all to believe this problem is restricted ' as if by magic ' to just the CDC. Parallel government agencies with similar or related functions are just as compromised. Truth is a minor concern (or even just plain problematical) for these corrupt elements whose primary interest appears largely to be lining their pockets with a lot of cash. 
The SPIDER letter also outlines some other issues, including data manipulation by the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion in the Wise Woman Program in order to present misleading results to Congress ('to make the results look better than they were.') As they said, 'definitions were changed and data 'cooked'' ' now where have we heard about definitions being changed before? Ah, yes, POLIO (but that's another scandal for another day). 
SPIDER added: 
An 'internal review' that involved staff across CDC occurred and its findings were essentially suppressed so media and/or Congressional staff would not become aware of the problems. 
SPIDER also singled out Drs. Barbara Bowman and Michael Pratt for their 'irregular (if not questionable) relationships with CocaÂ­Cola and ILSI representatives. Neither of these relationships were necessary (or appropriate) to uphold our mission. Neither organization added any value to the good work and science already underway at CDC'¦It appears to us that something very strange is going on with Dr. Pratt'¦His behavior and that of management surrounding this is very troubling.' 
Carey Gillam reported on the notorious Bowman and dubious Pratt (whose surname seems apt): 
Bowman, retired after revelations of what the complaint called an 'irregular' relationship with Coca-Cola and the nonprofit corporate interest group set up by Coca-Cola called the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). Email communications obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by USRTK revealed that in her CDC role, Bowman had been communicating regularly with ' and offering guidance to ' a leading Coca-Cola advocate seeking to influence world health authorities on sugar and beverage policy matters. 
Emails also suggested that Pratt has a history of promoting and helping lead research funded by Coca-Cola while being employed by the CDC. Pratt also has been working closely with ILSI, which advocates for the agenda of beverage and food industries, emails obtained through FOIA showed. Several research papers co-written by Pratt were at least partly funded by Coca-Cola, and Pratt has received industry funding to attend industry-sponsored events and conferences. 
It's all merely the tip of a corrupt and fetid iceberg, folks. 
Finally, the CDC SPIDER letter closes with: 
Why has the CDC OD turned a blind eye to these things. The lack of respect for science and scientists that support CDC's legacy is astonishing. Please do the right thing. Please be an agent of change. Respectfully, CDC Spider (CDC Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence and Ethics in Research) 
Remember, fellow change agents: it is agencies such as the CDC, AMA, TGA, etc. that are orchestrating the war on natural/'complementary' medicine. It is these outlets that are enacting Big Pharma's modern day Inquisition against natural healing and demonizing those modalities and their practitioners at every opportunity, employing the lap dog mainstream media to great effect. Simultaneously they engineer a cult-like mentality in the public at large, touting the unquestionable 'benefits' of various mainstream interventions while aggressively discouraging any free thinking or critical analysis. Anyone who points out the well documented risks or harms resulting from said 'wonderful' interventions is mocked and ostracised in the most juvenile form of groupthink imaginable. Welcome to 1984 , 2016 style. 
Beware the players with the deepest pockets ' they have the motive and the means for distorting collective reality and convincing millions of us that black is white and 2 + 2 = 5. 
I'm pretty sure that 2 + 2 = 4, even when it's not 'PC,' and even when our government agencies and ministers insist the answer is '5.' 
Not to worry ' there are legal means of dealing with their mendacity and complicity. 
The truth will out.

#InNorthDakota ~~ PALESTINIANS STAND WITH THE SIOUX 
October 26, 2016 

Palestinians know too well the threat to their own water supply '¦. 
As Native communities face an ongoing genocide and continue to resist the imperialist settler-colonial regime of the United States, Palestinians are too experiencing a genocide and ethnocide within our homelands from the settler-colonial state of Israel.' 
Image by Carlos Latuff 'Water is life for all of us': Palestinian activists join Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to protest DAPL Palestinians join Standing Rock Sioux to protest Dakota Access Pipeline 
Nadya Raja Tannous 'Perhaps only in North Dakota, where oil tycoons wine and dine elected officials, and where the governor, Jack Dalrymple, serves as an adviser to the Trump campaign, would state and county governments act as the armed enforcement for corporate interests. In recent weeks, the state has militarized my reservation, with road blocks and license-plate checks, low-flying aircraft and racial profiling of Indians. The local sheriff and the pipeline company have both called our protest 'unlawful,' and Gov. Dalrymple has declared a state of emergency. It's a familiar story in Indian Country. This is the third time that the Sioux Nation's lands and resources have been taken without regard for tribal interests. The Sioux peoples signed treaties in 1851 and 1868. The government broke them before the ink was dry. When the Army Corps of Engineers dammed the Missouri River in 1958, it took our riverfront forests, fruit orchards and most fertile farmland to create Lake Oahe. Now the Corps is taking our clean water and sacred places by approving this river crossing.' ' Dave Archambault II , Chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, opinion piece in the NY Times The Bakken formation in the northern United States and southern Canada is listed by US energy companies as one of the most promising options for national oil extraction, only surpassed in size by the oil fields in Alaska . The fields in North Dakota have been increasingly targeted for Bakken shale oil resources over the past years and they are quite familiar with public controversy: many of us remember the proposal of the infamous Keystone XL pipeline from 2008-2015, which was held in starkly low public opinion and struck down twice by the Obama administration . The proposed Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) is not so different from its failed counterpart. It is mapped out for the same length of 1,172 miles as the Keystone XL and is targeting the same Bakken shale reserves for carry across the upper Midwest . The proposed $3.8 billion dollar DAPL would transport 570,000 barrels of crude oil per day across four states and cross the Missouri River itself. Parent company, Energy Transfer Partners is selling the pipeline as an economic booster, job creator , and sure investment for the future of the American people. Yet, who exactly are they referring to and who did they consult? In the hills outside of Bismarck, North Dakota is the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, sitting along the banks of the Cannonball River, a tributary to the Missouri River. The pipeline construction sites can now be seen from the reservation, but many people here saw the pipeline coming before it even arrived. Just as Energy Transfer Partners and TransCanada failed to consult Native Tribes who live along the planned pipeline route and whose sacred lands, ancestral lands, and main water sources will be compromised by construction, there has not been a single tribal consultation around the proposed DAPL. On April 1st , Sacred Stone Spirit Camp was erected on the bank of the Cannonball as a residence for water protectors, many whom came from within and off the reservation to stand against pipeline construction, call for water preservation, and call for recognition of the Federal treat ies held with the Great Sioux Nation. What started out as a few hundred people quickly increased into the thousands, stemming the creation of the Oceti Sakowin and Red Warrior Camps on the other side of the Cannonball. Protectors, support, and solidarity with Standing Rock are arriving from all edges of the world, many of them representing Indigenous Nations . My own caravan set out from California the 2nd week of September, preceding the Palestinian Youth Movement-USA Caravan that arrived soon after. As a contingent of Indigenous peoples in diaspora and recent settlers on Turtle Island , we attest that those standing at Standing Rock are standing for our present and future as well. We must in turn stand for each other against the present, future, and historical supremacies of erasure, the active legacy of settler-colonialism, and the viciousness of greed. The pipeline company seems to remain unconcerned by the risk of polluting the reservation's main water source, the highly probable degradation of land and sacred sights, and their trespass against a series of federal laws , and they are becoming increasingly reactionary to the flow of protectors in and out of the protector camps and surrounding areas. Just a few weeks ago, on September 28th, alarming images and video were released of armed police and military-style vehicles cornering protectors holding a prayer ceremony at a North Dakota construction site. The video portrayed the intensity on the ground and just how vulnerable the protector camps are without the gaze of the public eye: 'They are moving in' 'They won't let us leave. They have locked us in on both sides' 'They've got their weapons drawn' 'They've got snipers on top of the hill' 'They're blocking me on Facebook' 'They are arresting everyone now. Everyone is running' 'Share this far and wide' ' Transcript of LiveStream video via Unicorn Riot The militarized forces blocked the only exit from the site to the public road before arresting 21 protectors . Other attendees posted photos of a crop dusting plane releasing a gas or chemical over the crowd. There has been little clarity thereafter of the makeup of the compound or the purpose of the spray. The participation and planning of direct actions against DAPL construction, however, are continuing, with over 100 cars caravanning out to 5 construction sites the week of October 3rd and successfully halting construction for the day. Local authorities, private security hires, and the National Guard are seemingly disturbed by the presence of protectors as well, and are going out of their way to restrict access in and out of the protector camp area and intimidate newcomers. Indeed my own caravan coming from California was discouraged from approaching the reservation on the main road running from Bismarck, ND due to the checkpoints erected by North Dakota authorities. Our longwinded encounter with the highway patrol on our way to North Dakota ' who insisted on not only checking all of our IDs followed by standing on the side of the highway outside of the car for an hour but also 'passed our information down the line to the authorities higher-up' including suspicions of illegal activity ' seemed to be motivated to dissuade an influx of supporters into the area. Stories of license plate checks, racial profiling of Native and ethnic drivers and/or car passengers, as well as arrests at roadblocks, circulated through the camps. Democracy Now , The New York Times , Huffington Post , and many independent news sources also reported these same tactics. Why did I go in the first place? Because somewhere in the awkward power dynamic of being a US citizen, a non-native inhabitant of Turtle Island , and a Palestinian in the Diaspora, I saw the struggle for livelihood and culture, the struggle against settler-colonialism, the struggle to protect the sacred and maintain your own legitimacy, and the ever ominous force of erasure and historical amnesia. What I later saw at Standing Rock both embodied this and became bigger than it; as a Mohawk Elder said to me, 'Without water, we [humans] are infertile dust'. At a council fire in Oceti Sakowin during my stay, 280 Indigenous Nations were thanked for their support and representation at the camps. Movement leaders at Sacred Stone Spirit Camp have repeatedly stated that the gatherings of different Indigenous Nations near Cannonball, ND is the largest in the past 150 years on the North American continent . The council fire sits at the mouth of the main entrance of Oceti Sakowin Camp, outlined by rows of flags representing many of the Indigenous Nations who have come to stand with Standing Rock. At the end of one of the rows is the Palestinian flag. Seeing it filled me equally with joy and sadness because it confirmed two things that I had pondered throughout the long drive from California to North Dakota: the first thought is that the power of collective resistance against greed and settler-colonialism is a mighty force. That thought was embodied by my joy to see a representation of will by the presently unseen Palestinian siblings who had come to take a stand against destructive powers. The second thought was embodied by sadness for, if the struggle for protection of water, culture, land, heritage, and livelihood is truly mirrored in Standing Rock and Palestine, then the struggle ahead is both vast and uncompromising. I spoke with many inspiring protectors from the Maori in New Zealand, indigenous representatives from Ecuador, Canadian representatives from the Blackfoot Nation who were longtime activists in the 'Idle No More' mobilizations, and Dakota/Lakota/Nakota from Standing Rock and the neighboring reservations among so many others. From a variety of perspectives and personal stories, the same foundational message was repeated back to me: this stand isn't just about standing for Native rights, it is about protecting the water, protecting our earth and securing the livelihood of our next generations. Water is life for all of us. Myself and fellow members of the Palestinian Youth Movement'United States Branch had reflected on the latter thought when we authored our statement of solidarity 'with the Standing Rock Sioux, the Great Sioux Nation and our other native sisters, brothers and siblings in the fight against the DAPL', circulated on September 7th. Segments read: 'We condemn all forms of state violence against our First Nation siblings and denote that the undermining of their sovereignty and livelihood is a part of the continuing dialectic of settler-colonialism transnationally. Since the arrival of settlers on Turtle Island, First Nations have resisted genocide and displacement. From seizure of land to reservations, from boarding schools to massacres, the state has done everything in its power to erase and eradicate First Nation peoples. Yet, they are still with us today and they continue to resist. Protecting their land, people, and future generations from the DAPL is a testament to their strength and resilience. '¦. As Native communities face an ongoing genocide and continue to resist the imperialist settler-colonial regime of the United States, Palestinians are too experiencing a genocide and ethnocide within our homelands from the settler-colonial state of Israel.' The comparisons are uncanny. I had spent most of the hours on the road to North Dakota contemplating the connections between the obstacles and oppressions facing those in Standing Rock and the obstacles and oppressions facing we Palestinians under occupation and apartheid. However, upon arriving at Standing Rock, I no longer just thought about the similarities, I felt them in my bones. When protectors at Standing Rock asked me about what Palestinians experience in our own fight against settler-colonialism , oppression, and greed, I answered sometimes through the language of statistics. Yet, more often, I told them narratives of genocide, exile, delegimitzation, broken promises, and resounding resilience. Sitting around a fire, burning sage and cedar wood, Darlene Meguinis of the Blackfoot Nation in Canada reflected on the beginnings of the Idle No More movement, in which she is still an active organizer. She told me: 'Everything must start with prayer and ceremony, especially organizing.' She reminded me that the founders of Idle No More , elders Nina Waste, Jessica Gordon, Sheelah Mcleen, and Sylvia McAdams, had rooted the movement in ceremony. The result of doing so, Meguinis maintained, was to center the focus of the collective actions for change. Native youth in the #NoDAPL Youth Council at Standing Rock reiterated similar ideas about DAPL actions. Two youth leaders recounted to me, 'we are striving for the results that we want to see but are being directed by our ancestors. We are here, acting now, for our children.' Intention and prayer surrounded much of the daily camp life and easily dispersed the tensions outside, even as the DAPL Company and National Guard helicopters flew low over the camps each morning, afternoon and night (something that pointedly reminded me of life in Palestine). Some mornings along the bend of the Cannonball River, which delineates Oceti Sakowin/Red Warrior Camp from Sacred Stone Spirit Camp, Native artists reflected the beauty around them in paintings and art installations. One of the organizers was Albuquerque artist Monty Singer, whose picture is shown below. The time set out to create art and music, to gather around fires and drum circles, to participate in prayer and ceremony with each other uplifted the vibrant energy of the camps and the people within them. We cheered, prayed and supported the direct actions as best we could every day; donations from across the U.S. and internationally flooded into the main entrance in the afternoons and community kitchens and donation booths ran 24/7 to maintain the swelling of protector numbers. Hundreds of people ebbed and flowed into the camps every single day. The sheer power required to uphold the movement is sobering: in light of the failed injunction by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe against the US Army Corps of Engineers at the lower court level, a Federal Appeals court officially halted construction of the pipeline, underlining the same temporary hold parameters as the decree proposed on September 9th by the Department of Justice (DOJ ). That hold applies solely within 20 miles on either side of Lake Oahe near the Missouri River. Other locations on the planned pipeline route are still open for construction and, though direct actions at sites of DAPL construction have not wavered, they are increasingly receiving less and less media attention with increasingly severe charges being applied to protectors. For example, the 5 protectors who strapped themselves to bulldozers at an active DAPL construction site 100 miles down Hwy 94 from the reservation during my stay at Oceti Sakowin Camp were slapped with felony charges for 'criminal trespassing', the same charges outlined against Amy Goodman in her arrest warrant as a result of her coverage of the DAPL in early September (although her charges at the time constituted a misdemeanor and were thankfully dropped October 17th after a court hearing ). Some of those arrested were even extradited back to their home states to face their charges from North Dakota in addition to preexisting protest charges in other states. My last night in Standing Rock, I spoke with a woman by the name of 'Terry', a resident of Bismarck, ND. I asked her why I had met so few non-natives from the local area at Standing Rock. Her response was direct and had very little to do with the sheriff's implemented checkpoints and roadblocks: 'It is because of the media propaganda. For example, during the dog attacks, Bismarck news covered a worker's injury at the site and the hospitalization of a guard. No one gave popular air time or writing space to cover the effects of the dog attacks on protectors.' She mentioned that an article in the conservative paper, Town Hall , soon after the attacks read: ' So dogs were unleashed on these protestors. Good '. She and a few others from Bismarck came to the camps because they saw past the media pressure. 'We understand that the fight for clean water and recognition of Native sovereignty affects everyone in the surrounding area', she told me, which would become increasingly apparent if oil leakage wells up in the Bakken region. In Geneva, on September 20th, Dave Archambault II, Chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, urged the UN Human Rights Council to stand with the tribe in opposing the DAPL project and advocate for the recognition of their sovereign rights, including the protection of water and sacred places . Protectors are remaining vigilant on and off site, many walking to pay respects to the graves of the Dakota/Lakota/Nakota ancestors that have been disturbed by construction. Martina Looking Horse, a longtime writer from Cheyenne River Reservation, has been camping at Standing Rock for over a month. She told me that she and her family plan to stay until the pipeline is defeated but stressed that the conditions at camp are not easy to live under. The torrential rainstorms, the swings of hot and cold, and the impending North Dakota winter discourage many from staying longer than a few weeks. Yet, Looking Horse affirmed her belief that she and many others will carry on, with or without the support of mainstream media. The hope, she reaffirmed, is that the national and international people of conscience will continue to support in all the ways that they can, hold the US government accountable to their promises, and not forget that the protectors are still there taking a stand. The day that I left, the PYM-United States Branch's official caravan came into Oceti Sakowin, bringing supplies, people power, and small gifts for the tribal council as visitors to the land. They also read our statement at the tribal council fire and met many people, as I had, who stated how glad they were to see Palestinians supporting the front lines against movement suppression. The solidarity with Palestine for all of us who participated in caravans from PYM was overwhelming. What was supposed to be a few-day trip was extended into a week. Inspired by the stories, the people, the call to our moral responsibility to protect each other and the water that keeps us alive, we hope to return back to Standing Rock and bring supplies for winter. Friends of Sabeel North America also sent forward a statement of solidarity , in part remarking: 'we know that settler colonialism depends on the exploitation of land and natural resources to the detriment of indigenous communities'¦Today, we see you, the Sioux nation and members of the other 280 Native American tribes who have joined you to protect the water of the Missouri River and stop the Dakota Access Pipeline, taking a stand for all life, the embodiment of resilience. As the Israeli occupation continues, Palestinian land is stolen, ancient olive trees are uprooted, and blood is shed, your struggle inspires our work and we redouble our efforts to witness and nonviolently resist. We stand in full support of indigenous sovereignty and self-determination.' The light of hope in Standing Rock is not fizzling out. Upon returning to the Bay Area, I came across many art builds and donation efforts, and have been seeing many more events publicized by friends and family in New York State, Virginia, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona. Thanks to Caleb Duarte and the wonderful youth from Fremont High School in Oakland (recently arrived unaccompanied youth from Chimeltenango, Guatemala) who made this solidarity banner: Art build in Oakland, CA : Recent unaccompanied minors from Guatemala write 'Water is Life' in Maya. (Photo: Nadya Tannous) * Dignidad Rebelde woodblock print at the Oakland Art Build for Standing Rock. (Photo: Nadya Tannous) I remember thinking as I left Standing Rock to return to California: peoples suppressed by power and greed have strength when they rise together. There is a poignant uniting force through something as important as the world that sustains us. The river was quiet when I left, with lots of green and tall grass on its banks. The river flats lay muddy and fertile, the slow current reflecting the sky day and night, the water turning pink and orange by sunset. A water protector strapped to heavy machinery down the Hwy 94 shouted out , before being removed to jail, 'This pipeline is a pipeline to the past. We need to be building sustainable infrastructure for the future, not destructive unsustainable industries that hurt land, that hurt water, that hurt people. Everything is wrong about this pipeline'¦ We're here standing in solidarity with millions of people from around the world that are against this pipeline.'

Randy Maugans & Jeffrey Sewell | Metabiology face to face with Artificial Intelligence Published on Sep 20, 2016 We are speaking on a subject that is vital for humanity to comprehend, AI or artificial intelligence, our objective is to further disclose how this is influencing humanity in subtle and not so subtle ways, for without knowledge of its existence or comprehension of its prevalence humanity is easily being led into more sophisticated technological control mechanisms. 
Jeffrey Sewell has spent many years in deep study of biology, in the process he introduces us to Metabiology, the tenants are simple, 'As above, so below' holds true from the nucleus of a cell to the furthest reaches of distant galaxies, life begets life. And it does so in a miraculous pattern that is reflected from the cosmos to the super organism, our Earth and to each of us in our divine vessel, the human body. From his website: http://cytocosmos.com 
'Metabiology is a study of the invisible systems of life spanning from the subatomic to the celestial. ['¦] By using cell biology as a template, we are able to map elements within the cell to elements of unseen systems. The latter elements are obtained by cross referencing multiple sources of material from the OBE/LBL/NDE experiencer community. These so-called astral systems map quite nicely to systems in the cell, and they tell the same narrative, albeit the complexity and sophistication of cellular earth is many times that of the cell. 
Much of the understandings derived from such mappings are echoed in the deeper cosmologies and teachings of the ancient world religions. Examples include; Sumerian, Egyptian, Kabbalah, Gnostic, Kashmir Shivaism, and Vedanta. Jungian Psychology has also proven to be useful in mapping out the cellular psyche. 
This is the science of 'as above, so below' in a very literal sense. The invisible is inner visible within the generalized cell itself. We can therefore grasp and ground the unseen systems of life by mapping them to the empirical biology of the cell. The implications of what this science has to offer reach all the way from psychology to cosmology and particle physics. 
The primary tenet of Metabiology is that we have inherited biology from systems of life that exist both above and before us. Should it be surprising? After all, we are children of the living universe. The Cytocosmos is a multidimensional living fractal, a cellular holarchy that has hitherto been called the universe.' 
Randy Maugans is the beloved radio show host of 'Offplanet Radio' http://radio.offplanetmedia.net/ Who doesn't pull his punches speaking his truth. His many years in the medium of the the alternative media and on the internet has given him an ample arena to study the affects of the infiltration of AI and its interface with human consciousness. 
claudia and christine co-founded 'Earth Empaths' and this YouTube channel 'Not In Our Name.''¦ The truth no matter where it leads us.

Embodying The Monad, A Session Transcript 
ES Forum Reference Link (Jan. 2011): 
This gives us the bigger picture and an understanding of why embodying the monad right now is so important. The suggested invocation will follow. 
There are two agendas happening simultaneously for 2012 and beyond. 
On one level there is a battle happening over the control of the souls here. The beings that are entrenched in the first three chakras are being subjected to more aggressive and more amounts of technology geared to break down the mental body. 
The algorithms that create the binary process of the linear mind meaning, how our solar plexus projects impulses that our physical brain picks up, that process is being interrupted with static, harnesses and mind control. If a person is not in their own power, they will be influenced to either be possessed by consciousness entities or possessed by forces that they act out that they don't understand. This is the agenda of the negative aliens who are continuing to be aggressive with these technologies. 
As fragmented souls become more stressed out and engage in more negative behavior, at a certain point the body's aura will include more percentage of that possessed dark energy. If a person is 49% light and 51% dark, that person will be sucked like a vacuum. A person that is primarily in fear or sick, they will get sucked down like a magnetic pull and it will cause that person to fragment. Their soul and seed atom will shatter. This is the metatronic black heart, which is essentially a reversal monad pulled down into a phantom system. The controllers want to destroy the actual crystal seed atom and have it be disconnected from the body. By doing this, they create an automaton, which is a body that is human but is not animated by any kind of soul , only a finite life force. 
Simultaneously to that, there are those of us that are in the light warrior family or the galactic family starting to embody new levels of our spirit bodies that are starting to be returned to us (the monad) and with that god technology and consciousness technology we are learning new ways to work with the technology and some of that has required new levels of dark arts training. 
We are attempting to embody as much of our monadic consciousness and activate the seed atom. As we activate the seed atom, we activate and change the pulse rhythm in the grid on the planet. So many areas of the planetary grid are damaged, so they are going in reversals patterns. If we can hold this base pulse rhythm, we create a circumference in an area where we can literally create a safe zone. We are being asked to create a safe zone by Guardian contacts. If we can embody this, we create a safe zone on the planet. The more of us that do this, the more safe zones we are going to have. More people are going to have the opportunity to be able to pick up the code they need and not get sucked down into the controllers system where their seed atom could get shattered. 
We must embody this consciousness and architecture and hold it in our location. Our location is never an accident. This is our assignment meaning where we are, where we are holding it is where we need to anchor it down. 
We seem to have a goal to get a lot of this done by 2011 and ongoing. We are trying to meet a goal of a certain threshold of healing by November 11, 2011, which is 11/11/11. At strange at it may sound, bodies are freed now and we need to get them to their rightful owner. 
Here is an explanation of the changes and adjustments that are happening in our bodies as the monad comes in and the Christ seed gets activated: 
'There are multidimensional centers in the body that are called flame access points and they control the neurological processes in the physical body and also adjust the brain nervous system. As the body undergoes adjustments in the heart chakra, I am understanding that particular part of the bio computer which is controlled by the monad. So this is the nervous system adjustment that is controlling the currents that work with the pulsation on the heart rhythm. And then there is the heart rhythm axiatonal line upgrade in the center of the chest and heart. The flame access points work with a part of the architecture on the heart chakra where these points come out of the heart and are a part of breathing the zero point. 
We the starseeded ones are working with biological prototyping and we hold these certain levels of architecture. The holding of the Mother Arc is that 13th dimensional frequency which has to do with the universal monad and the dimensional 13 monad frequency of the Mother Arc. Generally I note that the monadic core is the 8th dimensional chakra in the thymus area where this starts to open up and the crystalline structure of the heart and its function starts changing. Layers 1-7 are planetary. 8th and above layers are off planet, galactic, multiple bodies that exist in other planets and star systems. The monadic 8th dimension and how it connects with the mother energy, changes biorhythms and certain chemicals that relate to the heart function. 
The permanent seed atom or the Christ seed starts coming on line when the monad starts connecting to the body. Higher spirit body starts connecting to the body at the thymus level and starts adjusting the heart pattern. It causes change in hormones, endocrine, biorhythms like a domino effect when the monad starts coming on line. 
The Egyptians knew that our endocrine system was responsible for secreting hormones and those hormones were responsible for our neurology being able to perceive other dimensions. The hormonal secretions change our neurochemistry and then align us to the broadcast to those particular windows of the soul. 
The monad is the 7th, 8th and 9th layer but it starts connecting at the 8th chakra level which is the heart. When the monad starts coming in like this, the whole heart changes pattern meaning the heart chakra is no longer an astral heart, it is a blue heart. Your heart turns blue and the frequency coming through starts turning blue. They were showing me something new I have never seen before which is that blue connection to the turquoise of the mother. So the 8th dimension is a gold color but when the monad starts flowering in the heart and the heart starts to configure, it actually looks blue and they call this the living lotus. I call this galactivation. 
When our heart is healed, there is a fire that is ignited inside the heart that is accessed and the fire in the heart is also in the kidneys. There is a triangle that connects the heart into the kidneys. The kidneys are in the base of the triangle from left to right and the point of the triangle is in the heart. When the heart is healed, there is a twin flame ignition in our heart and kidneys, which shifts the heart configuration. Twin flames = structure of light within the heart. So two flames ignite in the heart. The monad is the greater flame and the physical body is the lesser flame. When this flame is ignited, there is an ignition in the heart and a fire coming in to the kidneys. 
How it impacts the 5th chakra, thyroid and parathyroid, glandular system, and secretions of the brain tell the brain how the heart and breathing rhythm work. It is a vast circulatory system including meridians, axiatonal lines, and the multiple levels of bodies of complexity working toward the physical embodiment of the Christ consciousness. This is about igniting the Christ consciousness eternal seed atom and bring that on line. The Monadic spark starts to connect to the seed atom, which is the Christ consciousness and our crystal body. 
This is the seed that the controllers are attempting to crush or stop from flowering in the human population. They want to crush the permanent seed atom in the thymus, which is the 8th chakra, which is where the monad starts coming in and actually connecting in to the body.'

Meet the journalist facing 45 years in jail for filming the tar sands pipeline protest in North Dakota 
Thursday, October 27, 2016 
Are North Dakota authorities waging a war against the public's right to know about the ongoing Standing Rock pipeline protests? We are joined by documentary filmmaker Deia Schlosberg, who was charged earlier this month with three felonies for filming an act of civil disobedience in which climate activists manually turned off the safety valves to stop the flow of tar sands oil through pipelines spanning the U.S. and Canada. 
The actions took place in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and Washington state. Schlosberg is an award-winning filmmaker and was the producer of Josh Fox's recent documentary, 'How to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Can't Change.' She was filming the action at a valve station owned by TransCanada in Walhalla, North Dakota. She was arrested along with the activists, and her footage was confiscated. Then she was charged with a Class A felony and two Class C felonies'which combined carry a 45-year maximum sentence. 
For original video interview please click here . TRANSCRIPT 
AMY GOODMAN: But we're joined right now in Los Angeles by Democracy Now! video stream by Deia Schlosberg, the award-winning documentary filmmaker, producer, who was arrested on October 11th in a different area of North Dakota, while reporting on a climate change protest in Walhalla, North Dakota, charged with three felonies, facing 45 years in prison, if convicted. Also with us, Josh Fox. His article in The Nation, 'The Arrest of Journalists and Filmmakers Covering the Dakota Pipeline is a Threat to Democracy'and the Planet.' His previous documentaries include Gasland, which first exposed the harms of the fracking industry, nominated for an Academy Award, also made Gasland 2, which aired on HBO. 
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Deia, describe what happened to you. 
DEIA SCHLOSBERG: Well, on October 11th, I was working as a climate reporter, as I've done for years and years and years, as Josh and I were doing, and the rest of the How to Let Go of the World team, when we made the film. And I was documenting people taking a stand, people on the frontlines of the fight to lessen the impacts of climate change. So, there were'there were five activists across four states that had planned to turn the emergency shutoff valves on the five pipelines that bring all Canadian oil sands into the U.S. And I was documenting this occurrence at the North Dakota site, outside of Walhalla, as you said. I was'I was filming the action. I was on public land. I was on a public road and at no point trespassed, at no point, you know, broke in or destroyed any property. I had nothing to do with the planning of the event. I was there to document it. I think it's essential for journalists to'journalists and filmmakers to go where the mainstream media is not. And there's a major hole in the coverage of climate change and people that are already dealing with the consequences of climate change and people that are fighting climate change. So, I take that responsibility very seriously. 
AMY GOODMAN: So when did the police come? 
DEIA SCHLOSBERG: The police came after'well, the activist that was doing the action, Michael, had called the company ahead of time to say that he was'he was going to shut off the valve, so they could'to give them ample time to take any emergency precautions. And then he turned the valve. And meanwhile, the company notified the local police. So, after the valve was closed, they came in probably about 15 minutes. I had my camera set up on a tripod on the public road. And they told me I was arrested for being an accessory to a crime, at which point I was brought to the local jail . I figured it would'things would just have to clear up once they realized what was' 
AMY GOODMAN: So, they charged you with three felonies?

Crystals are a great tool for healing, awakening and raising your vibration. When I first started out on my spiritual journey it took me a while to truly appreciate the power of a crystal. 
When you find a crystal that really resonates with you and that you feel really attracted to, you know you have found the right one. 
For years, I chose crystals based on the written metaphysical properties and for some reason they always felt 'off' to me. When I started choosing crystals based on feeling alone, that is when I truly noticed their amazing abilities. 
Crystals contain a powerful energy for helping you to recharge your own vibration and connection to Spirit. 
Here are 3 ways to use your crystals to recharge: Mind, Body, Spirit Recharge 
Perfect for an all-over recharge for your energy, best done just before bed. 
1.) Choose 3 crystals that resonate with you- one for your mind, one for your body and one for your spirit. Make sure your crystals are cleansed. 
2.) Hold the physical body crystal in your hand and set your intention into the stone. Whisper what outcome or feeling you would like to create in your physical body. Hold the stone close to you as you repeat and feel your intention. Repeat this process for the mind and spirit crystals as well. 
3.) After setting your intention into your crystals, sleep with them under your pillow or by your bedside. 
4.) Keep your crystals close to you whenever you need an energy recharge. Positive Energy Recharge 
Perfect for recharging your energy after being around a negative person or situation. 
1.) Choose 2 powerful, cleansed crystals that resonate with you and place them in each hand. Gently close your hand around the crystals and breathe. 
2.) As your breathe feel the energy of the crystal moving up through your arms and travelling around your entire body. Feel the beautiful, vibes of the crystal cleansing and clearing your aura and energy. 
3.) Keep breathing through the cleansing until the energy of the crystal has travelled to every part of your body. 
4.) Cleanse your crystals if needed after you are done. Self- Empowerment Chakra Recharge 
Perfect for when you are lacking confidence in yourself. 
1.) Choose one crystal that resonates with you and place it out to be charged in the sunlight for at least 30 minutes. Alternatively, you can choose 7 crystals ' one for each chakra. 
2.) Once the crystal has been charged, start rubbing it between your hands to generate heat and more energy. 
3.) When you feel the heat or charge of the crystal, place your hands over your root chakra or pelvis area (touch your skin not your clothes). Allow the energy to sink in to this area of your body. 
4.) When you feel the energy has gone in, rub the crystal again and place it on your next chakra. Keep repeating this process until you have done all 7 chakras. 
Happy recharging!

Vintage News Tue, 25 Oct 2016 NasÄ«r al-DÄ«n TÅ«sÄ« was a Persian polymath and prolific writer: An architect, astronomer, biologist, chemist, mathematician, philosopher, physician, physicist, scientist, theologian and Marja Taqleed. He was of the Ismaili, and subsequently Twelver ShÄ«'ah, Islamic belief. The Muslim scholar Ibn Khaldun (1332 ' 1406) considered Tusi to be the greatest of the later Persian scholars.
Tusi has about 150 works, of which 25 are in Persian and the remaining are in Arabic, and there is one treatise in Persian, Arabic and Turkish. 
During his stay in Nishapur, Tusi established a reputation as an exceptional scholar. Tusi's prose writings represent one of the largest collections by a single Islamic author. Writing in both Arabic and Persian, Nasir al-Din Tusi dealt with both religious ('Islamic') topics and non-religious or secular subjects ('the ancient sciences'). His works include the definitive Arabic versions of the works of Euclid, Archimedes, Ptolemy, Autolycus, and Theodosius of Bithynia. 'A Treatise on Astrolabe' by Tusi, Isfahan, 1505. Source: Danieliness 
In his Akhlaq-i-Nasri , Tusi put forward a basic theory of the evolution of species almost 600 years before Charles Darwin was born. He begins his theory of evolution with the universe once consisting of equal and similar elements. According to Tusi, internal contradictions began appearing, and as a result, some substances began developing faster and differently from other substances. He then explains how the elements evolved into minerals, then plants, then animals, and then humans. Tusi then goes on to explain how hereditary variability was an important factor for biological evolution of living things: 
'The organisms that can gain the new features faster are more variable. As a result, they gain advantages over other creatures. ['¦] The bodies are changing as a result of the internal and external interactions.' The Astronomical Observatory of Nasir al-DÄ«n Tusi 
Tusi discusses how organisms are able to adapt to their environments: 
'Look at the world of animals and birds. They have all that is necessary for defense, protection and daily life, including strengths, courage and appropriate tools [organs] ['¦] Some of these organs are real weapons, ['¦] For example, horns-spear, teeth and claws-knife and needle, feet and hoofs-cudgel. The thorns and needles of some animals are similar to arrows. ['¦] Animals that have no other means of defense (as the gazelle and fox) protect themselves with the help of flight and cunning. ['¦] Some of them, for example, bees, ants and some bird species, have united in communities in order to protect themselves and help each other.' Iranian stamp for the 700th anniversary of his death 
Tusi recognized three types of living things: plants, animals, and humans. He wrote: 
'Animals are higher than plants, because they are able to move consciously, go after food, find and eat useful things. ['¦] There are many differences between the animal and plant species, ['¦] First of all, the animal kingdom is more complicated. Besides, reason is the most beneficial feature of animals. Owing to reason, they can learn new things and adopt new, non-inherent abilities. For example, the trained horse or hunting falcon is at a higher point of development in the animal world. The first steps of human perfection begin from here.' A stamp issued in the republic of Azerbaijan in 2009 honoring Tusi 
Tusi then explains how humans evolved from advanced animals: 
'Such humans [probably anthropoid apes] live in the Western Sudan and other distant corners of the world. They are close to animals by their habits, deeds and behavior. ['¦] The human has features that distinguish him from other creatures, but he has other features that unite him with the animal world, vegetable kingdom or even with the inanimate bodies. ['¦] Before [the creation of humans], all differences between organisms were of the natural origin. The next step will be associated with spiritual perfection, will, observation and knowledge. ['¦] All these facts prove that the human being is placed on the middle step of the evolutionary stairway. According to his inherent nature, the human is related to the lower beings, and only with the help of his will can he reach the higher development level .' SOTT Comment: Note that, unlike Darwin's version of the theory , which resulted in a proliferation of ideas about the 'survival of the fittest' that encouraged man's baser nature and justified European imperialism, Tusi's theory of evolution apparently underpinned ideas about higher man's spiritual development .

OCTOBER 27, 2016 
by Pamela Williams 
There is breaking news that a no-fly zone has been declared over the Dakota Access Pipeline area at Standing Rock, North Dakota. Protestors and Native American activists have set up a new camp called 'Front-Line Camp' where they are making their last stand against the party Energy Transfer Partners, who are working on the Pipeline. The Sioux Tribe has declared eminent domain over the water rights and sacred land rights in the same area as the Pipeline is being built. They are asking for prayers as they make a great stand against the destruction of their sacred land. 

Pipeline opponents attempting to protect their water supply from the Dakota Access oil pipeline (DAPL), as well as prevent the continued destruction of burial grounds and cultural sites, are anticipating a confrontation with police today. This news come after 'water protectors' refused law enforcement requests to vacate reoccupied land in the pipeline's path, owned by Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners. 
http://thesccop.com/breaking-no-fly-zone-declared-as-militarized-police-prep-for-assault-on-front-line-camp-at-standing-rock/ 

While Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Chairman Harold Frazier sat down with President Barack Obama at a private roundtable in Los Angeles on Tuesday, October 25, Morton County, N.D. Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier was calling in police reinforcements from six states to enforce Energy Transfer Partners' demands that 'trespassers' be removed from the path of the pipeline. 
Authorities implied they may forcibly remove the water protectors from the new camp, which is on land recently purchased by Dakota Access LLC, the subsidiary that is building the pipeline. 
'We have the resources. We could go down there at any time,' Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said, according to the Associated Press . 'We're trying not to.' 
'We are here to enforce the law as needed,' Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said. 'It's private property.' Share: Rate:

Energetic Report from October 24th, 2016 Yesterday evening after I had recovered somewhat from the steady, heavy blast of energy, and my headache, dizziness and nausea had subsided, Georgi called me to come look out of the window and there we saw a beautiful rainbow in the north-east. It was a vertical pillar of rainbow stripes that rose up into the sky before melding into a sea of deep grey cloud cover ' a storm had just rolled through. We were both happy to see this rainbow but at the same time we noticed there was something in the air that was very unusual. We felt a palpable change in the energy all around, and within the space of a couple of minutes it was as if everything was bathed in a blanket of soft, gentle golden light. Two more minutes and everything radiated a deep luminescent golden glow! It continued to deepen in intensity and suddenly the entire sky and every solid object was illuminated. White clouds had formed and were absorbing this luminosity from somewhere. This light did not come from our Sun; it was as though light was radiating out from the prana molecules themselves. Gold prana everywhere! The Sun was hidden behind a heavy bank of grey clouds to the west and it's light was just not present. And the glow intensified even further! Everything was covered in a deep and luminous gold and emanated an energy that was soft, gentle, peaceful and yet powerful, warm and loving. It was as though everything reflected a reality made of pure divine presence. It was heaven-sent and we witnessed it all unfold in its magnificent and stunning beauty. We were both in awe of this vision before us and it wasn't until we received this message from the Elohim that we realized that this light was the magnificent Resurrection Flame . We are certain others among you have seen or will see this light this week. We are with you all. Much love, Carla and Georgi Clarification The proton stream that is now flowing from the Central Sun via the massive coronal hole of our sun since October 24th, 2016 is different from the Resurrection Flame that is also coming from the Central Sun/Source. This is very important to observe. The latter consists of highest frequencies of light beyond the 5D, actually from the 12th dimension, while the protons are conscious God's particles that are the building elements of space-time and of all forms in 3D, 4D and lower 5D. This includes the creation of matter, all elements and substances, in 3D as we know it from the current holographic model on the earth. In order to illustrate how important the protons are for life, I must make you aware of a well-known fact in bio-sciences that has not been fully understood by most scientists before I explained its paramount importance in my pivotal book Volume III on bio-science and medicine. The entire metabolism in the cell and in the human organism that keeps the biological bodies alive represents a complex redox-cascade of biochemical reactions and cycles which are the major topic of biochemistry. The final product of these chemical processes is the degradation of the three major food classes ' carbohydrates, proteins and fatty acids ' and the separation of protons from water and the food chain in the mitochondria. These protons are then expelled on the outer side of the mitochondrial membrane and build a powerful proton gradient of more than one million voltmeters across this membrane. In fact, such electromagnetic (EM) gradients are built around all cellular and intra-cellular membranes and these gradients are the driving force ' the vis vitalis ' of organic matter, organic life. As I have written a lot in the past, I am the first scientist who has grasped the importance of the electromagnetic gradients in the cell and the organism and how they operate as powerful spherical capacitors . The entire chemical energy stored in the food (minus the heat (thermodynamic energy) that is emitted to the environment) is utilized in the body via the cell metabolism and is then transformed into electromagnetic energy of transmembrane EM gradients . The latter drive the entire cell regulation and body metabolism by releasing their energy in form of action potentials which can be easily measured, for instance, as ECG and EEG. Organic life, including the human body, is thus an energetic system based on a constant energy exchange between the chemical energy stored in the food and the electromagnetic energy stored as membrane potentials (gradients) across all biological membranes. In other words, our body is a very complex and fine-tuned electromagnetic system and not a biochemical system as present-day science wrongly assumes and exclusively describes. This is the greatest theoretical breakthrough in the history of bio-sciences that transforms them into a true biophysics based on the Universal Law and explains how the biological body is actually regulated. This includes the acceptance of higher dimensional operational systems beyond the electromagnetic spectrum and builds the scientific foundation and explanation of the Light Body Process (LBP) and how the human carbon-based body is transformed into crystalline light body in the course of the ascension process. Hence this message from the Elohim has a profound theoretical background rooted in the new Science of the Universal Law. In fact, we have published a few messages from the Elohim in the past that have announced similar powerful proton streams on this planet but the latest one is unique insofar as it is combined with the all-pervading Flame of Resurrection that has now triggered the long-awaited Reset of this 3D holographic model and its transfiguration to a higher dimensional multi-reality. As the End Time has always been described as the Time of Revelations , also known as Apocalypse in Greek as first mentioned in the Bible, we are very happy to announce the final stage of the End Time that will very soon lead to the final ID shift and our ascension. George The Elohim Message We are the Elohim and we greet you with the loving warmth of great love. There is a proton flow greeting all of humanity, and all of Gaia, coming from the Great Central Sun and moving through the space-time portal that is your Sun. This and every proton stream has a profound impact on each aspect of creation and it is no exception here within your third dimensional reality. Streams upon streams of charged consciousness flood space-time and this energy reaches all elements at the quantum level. This is an expanded consciousness, the conscious awareness of Creation itself. It is the time of the Revelations and this proton stream is the fuel for this sacred moment in time that is rightly called a re-set and that is the projected expansion of awareness proclaimed through the millenia. Bring forth now new confidence in the living intelligence of the Light! There was great all-pervasive golden light today (October 24th) ' flooding, penetrating and balancing energetic systems that are founded in light principle ' this was magnificent was it not? The golden light is the light of the resurrection. It moves to re-empower your body-mind-spirit system through the power chakra, the solar plexus and it does so at the quantum level. This is why you and many others felt extreme nausea this day and this is why the proton stream is the fuel for the reactivation action of the Resurrection of Life . Your reality is changing, one proton at a time. The proton is the conscious God particle, the God-energy if you prefer, that is needed to re-instill the divine blueprint in each and every expression. Restoration of the divine blueprint precedes balancing, and healing, in all life forms. This cherished moment is a gift for you to experience in full consciousness; the healing power of God's light, the light of Creation, the light which is founded in eternal love. Remember, you are created from these elements and therefore your highest expressions and grandest achievements are founded in love. We are the Elohim and we love you for ever. Share:

Discerning the Mystery Wednesday, October 26, 2016 The Pitfalls of Partial Disclosure ' Examining the Process of Disclosure and the Reasons why a String of Half-Truths Just Won't Cut It 
For almost a decade, many of us have heard about the concept and process of Disclosure . This is the complete release of formerly secret, official and governmental information through the public media. We have heard about the numerous possibilities of the truth of past events which exists behind closed doors'locked away in secret files protectively stamped with the word 'Classified.' We know that to a very large extent, we as the common public know very little about the truth behind roughly a century of government and corporate secrecy on matters of high technology, ET life, and the heinous crimes committed for the sake of maintaining this secrecy. The subjects within the topic of disclosure are extremely dense and weighty to consider. One could spend hours digesting just one of these topics, which are commonly considered fringe in today's society. However, we are here to discuss a different and yet parallel subject. This is the subject of individual choice, or more specifically, the choice to know . In order to see Disclosure, we must make the choice to be aware and have the courage to face the possibilities behind the truth which the disclosure will bring to light. Many of these truths will be unconventional, considering the fact that secrecy has defined convention for the past century. This does not mean that we should abandon our responsibility of thorough research and verification. It simply means that from vigorous research and diligent scrutiny, we must have the courage to face the information we encounter. 
Conscious Life Expo ' David Wilcock ' Page 1 ' New Intel, The Human Evolutionary Leap, Sacred Geometry, Illuminati Secrets, and More This article is dedicated to examining the concept of the partial disclosure , or the hindrance of the Disclosure process for the sake of a few financial interests. It is my hope that this article will help each and every one of us to discern and to face the truth the moment it is revealed. The Balance of Power There is one main reason for the need for a full-disclosure event to revolutionize the various societies of this planet. This Full Disclosure is to end the entirety of the secrecy for the sake of respect for the equality of all people. This disclosure is an acknowledgment to our right to know about all that affects our daily lives and represents the balancing of power among all people around the globe. With this balance in mind, it is important for us to know what power truly is. When we speak of power , many ideas may come to mind. Some of us may believe this word refers to one's ability to control others. Others may think of it as a matter of economic influence, and there are those who simply think of power as one's own ability to make their own choices. The truth is that all of these are valid definitions. To clarify, let's check the definition from Merriam-Webster for the word 'power.' : the ability or right to control people or things : political control of a country or area : a person or organization that has a lot of control and influence over other people or organizations If we consider these definitions of this word, we may notice something. Aside from the definitions which refer to mathematical applications, there seems to be no reference to human equality of any kind. It seems that in this official definition, the modern English language has all but completely done away with the fact that true power comes from the individual, and in essence, is equally distributed among all people. Let's consider a few examples. 
American Mind Control: The Cost of Secrecy Part 1 ' Examining the Effects of Secrecy, Propaganda, and Organized, White-Collar Crime 
Most of us are familiar with the concept of governmental monarchy. This is of course, the form of centralized government in which a single figurehead holds complete control over an area, province, or country. Yet even though this one individual supposedly holds all of this power, they would have no control at all unless everyone else agreed to allow them that control. Jacques Louis David ' The-Coronation of Napoleon In every ancient monarchical government structure, no single ruling figure could have held any such authority without the entire kingdom agreeing that they should. Generally speaking, if the people do not decide to follow, no authority can lead anyone in any way. A king or queen has dozens of servants, maids, butlers, cooks, groundskeepers and gardeners, craftsmen, and guards. They have advisers and clergymen who direct their political decisions, and armies of thousands who obey their every whim. However, not a single order of this monarchic figure would ever mean anything if the people chose not to follow them. 
Full Disclosure and Ascension ' Commentary of the Latest Article from David Wilcock In the common social interaction in which equality of power is acknowledged, there is no hierarchy. When one person starts giving orders to another, they probably won't get much from the person (except maybe the finger and/or some choice words). Now take these same two people'one giving the order and the other receiving that order'and place beside these two, five other people who are following the orders. Due to this situation, the compulsion to obey is somewhat increased. Now add in 10, 20, 50, or even an entire country of people doing as they are mandated to do by some unseen authority, and the compulsion to obey is compounded. Add in the ability of the authority to order punishment upon those who disobey, and this control is solidified. We as human beings have the conditioning to conform to whatever social situation we find ourselves in. This is not to say that this tendency cannot be overcome. It is merely to say that we are raised to conform to the collective of society. This social conformity may have a few positive aspects up to a certain point. However for those who appreciate independent thought and the freedom to choose for themselves, this pull to conform can be somewhat of an annoyance. The above example of this social tendency to conform demonstrates the psychological concept of social conditioning , or what many in modern days refer to as the sheep effect . 
Psych Central ' 'Herd' Mentality Explained 
The sheep effect could be described as the tendency of a person to automatically do whatever those around them are doing. This could simply be initiated by one person repeating an action, or it could be an entire group practicing . Eventually, you may have a large group of people doing the same thing over and over again without knowing why. The following clip comes from a show which airs on the National Geographic channel called Brain Games , and demonstrates a prime example of the sheep effect in action. Brain games ' Social conformity What Lies Beyond the Haze of Social Conditioning? So as we can see, it seems fairly easy to subtly coerce a suggestible person into following a social norm even though they have no logical reason for doing so. To be fair, this woman most likely reasoned to herself that the bell had something to do with being called for her appointment. What is interesting to see is that she never actually asked about why the group kept standing. There seems to have simply been the rationalization, immediately followed by conformity. This tendency of social conformity is a pervasive phenomenon which seems to grip the entirety of developed societies around the world. In fact, this conformity may be the one of the main reasons why large civilizations have developed in the way that they have. It is very likely that this coercion to conform has been used to create various facets of society, and to build that which has been built. However, as we may have seen, modern society doesn't serve all people equally. Instead the supposedly civilized world appears to be designed to use the individual for their entire lifetime. When society has taken the best years of life of the individual, it discards them while at the same time, it grooms their children to be used in the exact same way. 
Wisdom Teachings with David Wilcock ' 'The Cabal's Downward Spiral' ' Assessing the Final Days of a Crumbling Cabal, and a Prelude to Breakthrough This grossly exploitative societal structure appears to have been designed by those who benefit from it most. These benefactors don't work. They don't contribute, but in many ways they use and enjoy the spoils of everything that we the people work for. Due to their elitist mentality and upbringing, these manipulators have, in a sense, domesticated the rest of humanity to work as their own servants, and have collectively assumed the position of the monarch of ancient times'creating an oligarchy. So what's the significance of these discoveries, and what do they have to do with to partial disclosure? The Nature of Unbalanced Power The bottom line is that a partial disclosure would serve as a prime opportunity for more elitists to assume even more influential positions, and to seize more power than they deserve. Just like we have seen over the last century, any excess of power only compounds, and eventually corrupt those who hold it. 
Who's Investing in the Dakota Access Pipeline? Meet the Banks Financing Attacks on Protesters ' Extended Commentary and Links Included Over time, the common people will typically adapt to their lower societal positions'becoming more and more comfortable and increasingly dependent upon the state to direct their lives. At the same time, the common people will become less and less self responsible. Eventually, the people become so dependent and the state becomes so domineering and power-drunk that the people will submit to any plan'no matter how foolish or ridiculous'simply so that they can avoid self-awareness and self-responsibility.

By Maxine Bernstein | The Oregonian/OregonLive on October 27, 2016
A jury Thursday delivered a stunning across-the-board acquittal to the leaders and participants in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation and a remarkable blow to the federal government as it tries to tamp down a national movement led by a Nevada family to open public lands to ranchers, miners and loggers. 
The verdicts finding Ammon Bundy, older brother Ryan Bundy and five others not guilty of a federal conspiracy drew elation from defense attorneys who spent five weeks arguing that the armed takeover amounted to a time-honored tradition of First Amendment protest and civil disobedience. 
'Maybe this is a lesson that that's not the way to engage with these people, who want nothing more than just to be heard, just to have a forum to talk about the injustices like the case of the Hammonds and the treatment of ranchers,' said Lisa Ludwig, standby counsel for Ryan Bundy. 
The high-profile case riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the isolated bird sanctuary in rural eastern Oregon. The jury's decision proved no less dramatic and sets up a showdown in the next stage of the land-rights movement. 
The Bundy brothers still face prosecution in Nevada with their father, Cliven Bundy, all accused in the 2014 standoff at the patriarch's ranch over unpaid grazing fees that pitted the family and their supporters against federal Bureau of Land Management agents. 
The Oregon prosecutors sat silently in front of their boss, U.S Attorney Billy Williams, and the head of the FBI in Oregon, Greg Bretzing, as the judge announced the 'not guilty' pleas one by one. 
Williams later thanked the jury in a written statement. 'While we had hoped for a different outcome, we respect the verdict of the jury and thank them for their dedicated service during this long and difficult trial,' Williams said. 'We strongly believed that this case needed to be brought before a Court, publicly tried and decided by a jury.' 
Bretzing, whose agents led the response to the Jan. 2 refuge seizure, offered a slightly different take. 'We believe now ' as we did then ' that protecting and defending this nation through rigorous obedience to the U.S. Constitution is our most important responsibility.' 
Each defendant stood separately, facing the jury, as the judge read the verdicts. Ammon Bundy, his hands clasped behind his back, nodded as the 'not guilty' came for him first. As he sat, he smiled and rubbed the shoulder of his lawyer, Marcus Mumford. 
Ryan Bundy nodded his head and mouthed to jurors, 'Thank you.' 
'I had a very peaceful feeling but I didn't know we'd all be found not guilty,' said defendant Shawna Cox. ''¦ I'm so grateful to the jury.' 
Defendant Neil Wampler hugged his defense lawyer and gave her a kiss. 
But the trial fireworks weren't quite over. A brawl broke out at the very end, when six to seven U.S. marshals surrounded Ammon Bundy's lawyer as he stood before the judge, arguing and shouting for his client to walk out the door a free man. They tackled him and stunned him with a Taser gun. As Mumford yelled, 'What are you doing?,' U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown ordered, 'Everybody out of the courtroom!' 
'All I was asking for was papers,' Mumford said after emerging from federal custody nearly two hours later. 'Just show me you have the authority to take Mr. Bundy into custody.' 
Mumford was cited by Federal Protective Services for failure to follow a lawful order and creating a disturbance. He said the marshals overreacted. Several fellow defense lawyers echoed his sentiments, though one questioned Mumford's judgment. 
As for the verdict, Mumford said, 'Very pleased, very gratified. This jury was dedicated. They listened to our case.' 
Prosecutors had argued the case was simple: The refuge occupiers took control of a wildlife refuge that wasn't theirs. The heavily armed guards that manned the front gate and watchtower during the 41-day takeover, in an of itself, was 'intimidating,' and prevented officers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Bureau of Land Management from carrying out their work. 
But defense lawyers said they believe the jury held true to the judge's instructions, and couldn't find beyond a reasonable doubt that their 'intent' was to prevent the federal employees from going to work. 
Five of the seven defendants took the stand and said they were protesting the return to prison of Harney County ranchers Dwight Hammond Jr. and Steven Hammond, who faced a minimum mandatory five-year sentence for arson to federal land. Steven Hammond was convicted partially of setting fire to refuge property. They also said they were protesting federal government overreach, and didn't give much thought at all to the federal employees whose desks and offices they used throughout the refuge takeover. 
While it may be easier to show that defendants charged in a drug trafficking conspiracy shared a common goal, in this case there was 'no obvious underlying self-interest,' said Matthew Schindler, who represented Kenneth Medenbach. 
Schindler also said he believed the judge's decision to allow defendants to explain their 'state of mind,' at the time of the occupation boosted the defense case. The pull of jurors from across the state, not just Portland, also helped defendants, particularly regarding the weapons charges, Schindler said. 
The jury saw that the occupiers cared about the Hammonds and didn't like how the federal government was treating them, said David Fry's lawyer Per C. Olson. 
'I think the jury saw through this that they were well-meaning, well-intentioned individuals,' Olson said. 'It was the right verdict.' 
Lisa Maxfield, who represented Wampler, came out of the courthouse, holding up her fists. She said she has never seen 'anything like this happen,' where multiple defendants in a federal trial were all acquitted. It was one of the most significant cases in her career, she said. 
'It's a tremendous victory for rural America,' Wampler said outside the courthouse as supporter and fellow refuge occupier Brand Nu Thornton blew his shofar and another man rode his horse back and forth, hoisting an American flag. 
But others, like Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the Center for Western Priorities, worried the verdicts would spur other similar armed standoffs against the government's control of public lands that involve the militia. 
'We are deeply disappointed in today's verdict, which puts our park rangers and scientists at further risk just for doing their jobs. The outcome of today's trial will undoubtedly embolden extremist groups,' Rokala said. ' It's imperative that local, state, and federal law enforcement ensure the safety of our land managers.'

What myths have most of us been taught about Native Americans? In a new book, All the Real Indians Died Off And 20 Other Myths About Native Americans , Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz and Dina Gilio-Whitaker show how generations of people in the United States have been misinformed about Indigenous Americans as part of a colonial agenda of erasure. 
The following is the Truthout interview with Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz and Dina Gilio-Whitaker. 
Mark Karlin: I was profoundly enlightened when I interviewed you about your last book The Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States . Your new book, written with Dina Gilio-Whitaker debunks 21 myths about Native Americans. Before we get to the book, I want to start and ask you a truly global question, how is the Indigenous rights movement becoming increasingly transnational? 
Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz: The international Indigenous movement is becoming increasingly visible, but it has been developing since the early 1920s, when the Haudenosaunee (six Nations of the Iroquois federation) sent a representative, Cayuga leader Deskaheh, to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1923 to address the League of Nations. From the 1930s onwards, Muskogee Creek, Cherokee and Hopi representatives built ties with Indigenous Peoples in Central Mexico, where their peoples had originated. 
In 1940, The Interamerican Indian Convention was signed by the governments of the hemisphere, and the Interamerican Indian Institute was founded, which still exists today. In the 1950s, the newly established National Congress of American Indians in the United States and other Native activists actively sought ties with Indigenous Peoples in other parts of the world. But it was in 1974, with the founding of the International Indian Treaty Council by the militant American Indian Movement, and of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples, that formal relations with the United Nations began. 
The United Nations Sub-Commission on Racism and Racial Discrimination had taken up a study of Indigenous Peoples globally in 1972 and in 1977, the first international Indigenous Peoples conference was held at the United Nations ' the delegates of Indigenous representatives organized by the International Indian Treaty Council. After four years of arduous Indigenous lobbying, a UN Working Group on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was established and met for the first time in 1982, and thereafter annually for 25 years, resulting in massive documentation and testimonies, as well as official reports, and in the 2007 UN General Assembly resolution, the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . 
Early in the new millennium, a UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues were established, the latter meeting for two weeks annually at UN headquarters in New York, bringing together thousands of Indigenous Peoples' representatives. In addition to the institutional transnational relationships are the daily exchange of communications among Indigenous Peoples on local, regional and continental issues and emergencies, particularly effective during the past 20 years of increasing Internet capacity. 
What are the roles of erasure and disappearance in creating settler colonialist myth about Native Americans that then justify suppression and theft of land? 
Dina Gilio-Whitaker: Disappearance of the Indigenous population was necessary for the settler project to inherit the land that they believed was rightfully theirs, by divine providence. Very early on, for example, when the Mayflower immigrants of the Plymouth colony were starving and trying to figure out how to feed themselves, we know from primary documents that some of them found villages that had been emptied out due to a disease epidemic a year or two earlier, or in some cases, were still inhabited. They raided food stores and even graves, and saw it as an expression of God's favor on them, having gotten rid of the Indians so that they could now inhabit the land. 
By the 1840s this belief crystalized into the concept of manifest destiny. Then we begin to see the emergence of anthropology and what we now call scientific racism ' a science-based ideology that all non-white people are inferior to white Europeans . This Social Darwinism finds its way into Supreme Court decisions about Native lands and nations, which then become the basis for laws and policies that systematically justify extermination, forced assimilation and endless other depredations ' that all have at their root the goal of transferring Native lands into white ownership. This is why we say that settler colonialism is a structure that eliminates Natives so that settlers can replace them. And it is this structure that still frames the body of federal Indian law that governs what happens to Native nations and individuals today, all guided by the impulse to eliminate. 
You have a chapter on the myth that the US did not engage in a policy of genocide toward Native Americans. Given that's a loaded term that denialists love to split hairs about, wouldn't it just be easier to say the European conquerors maintained a policy of trying to make Native Americans vanish? 
Dunbar-Ortiz: The importance of the term 'genocide' for many Indigenous Peoples is that it is more than a term or an accusation; it is a word created in the wake of the Shoah in Europe to describe what happens when a people are targeted by a government for extermination, as were the Jews of Europe, and which is the term used in the most important international law related to concerned Indigenous Peoples, as the only international human rights law that pertains specifically to collectivities of people rather than individuals. 
We have researched and studied only US policies and actions related to Indigenous peoples in North America, but think that the analysis of the US applies to several of the republics of the Americas, as well as Australia and New Zealand, that imposed settler-colonialism on the Indigenous Peoples, seeking to displace and disappear Indigenous communities and nations to replace them with European settlers. 
As the late Australian anthropologist Patrick Wolfe wrote, 'The question of genocide is never far from discussions of settler colonialism.' The history of the United States is a history of settler colonialism. The objective of US authorities was to terminate their existence as peoples ' not as random individuals. This is the very definition of modern genocide. The term 'genocide' is often incorrectly assumed to mean extreme examples of mass murder associated with war, with the death of millions of individuals, as, for instance in Cambodia. Although clearly the Holocaust was the most extreme of all genocides, the bar set by the Nazis is not the bar required to be considered genocide. Most importantly, genocide does not have to be complete to be considered genocide. Cases of genocide carried out as policy may be found in historical documents as well as in the oral histories of Indigenous communities. An example from 1873 is typical, with General William T. Sherman writing, 
'We must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux, even to their extermination, men, women and children '¦ during an assault, the soldiers cannot pause to distinguish between male and female, or even discriminate as to age.' 
We talked about this in our last interview. Many historical accounts tried to make it appear that presidents and Congress viewed themselves as white saviors to Native Americans. Was that any different than the attitude of European colonialism that decimated vast populations in Africa, the Middle East and the Far East, for example? 
Dunbar-Ortiz: I think there's a great deal of similarity in this respect among various European and Euroamerican colonialisms, with attempts to justify the capitalist plunder that drove and drives the past 500 years of European and United States imperialism. One of the myths we include in the present book is on the presumed benevolence of US presidents towards Native Americans (Myth 9). 
What is different is the goal of elimination of the Native in the four sites of Anglo settler-colonialism in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Whether it was an expression of the 'laws of nature,' that is, the survival of the fittest as explicitly expressed by Andrew Jackson and the embrace of eugenics by Theodore Roosevelt during their presidencies, or in popular culture by Walt Whitman and other writers, or the disappearance through forced assimilation, such as the Indian boarding schools' goal to 'kill the Indian and save the man,' the stamping out and total disappearance of the Native was predominant. In the present, the way benevolence is expressed is in conceptualizing the Native as a historical relic; US people have to be constantly reminded that there are still existent Indigenous peoples and communities in North America, but whether left or right, recent immigrant or descendants of settlers, even descendants of enslaved Africans, the Native presence is not a consideration in the day to day life of individuals and municipal, state and national governments. 
Since we are coming close to this holiday, can you expand on dispelling the myth that Thanksgiving proves the Indians welcomed the pilgrims? 
Gilio-Whitaker: The story, as it is commonly conveyed, is a feel-good tale of a deep friendship between Pilgrims and Indians, signified by a formal, ostensibly prearranged engagement where they all sit down together to give thanks for a bountiful harvest. 
There is not enough evidence to surmise anything of the sort; what there is suggests that it was a random, rather accidental occurrence in which the Wampanoag were investigating the sound of gunfire coming from the English settlement, and then were invited to stay for dinner. The actual relationship between the Wampanoag and the pilgrims can best be described as a political alliance based on desperation and the mutual need for survival. Both were extremely vulnerable. 
The pilgrims needed the Indians to teach them how to live on the land, and extreme population decline due to disease had weakened the Wampanoag militarily. A treaty had been negotiated in an atmosphere of mistrust and tension. Within two years, it had completely broken down but then, after about 40 years of relative peace, by 1675 full-scale war had broken out between them, becoming what we know now as King Philip's War, what's been called the bloodiest war ever fought on American soil. 
This is too recent for your book, but I think your opinion on the activism surrounding the Dakota Access pipeline and the expanding support for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe should be explored. Do you think it is a threshold point for a new stage of defiant, stalwart activism on behalf of reclaiming sovereignty over Indigenous lands and water? 
Gilio-Whitaker: It remains to be seen, but at the moment it does seem that way. What we have to compare it to in this country is the Alcatraz occupation from 1969-1971, the Trail of Broken Treaties in 1972 and Wounded Knee in 1973. 
Those movements, like this one, were youth-led (although women are much more out front these days). Those were also the days that gave birth to the ethnic studies disciplines, and growing numbers of Indians becoming lawyers. So what we have now is new generations of Natives with sophisticated educations, and savvy political and organizing skills. They understand their history, they understand they're living with intergenerational trauma, but they still have enough of their cultures and traditions that have the power to heal them. And that makes them strong and relentless, like their ancestors before them. What's different now is that there are greater levels of support coming from non-Natives, because it's recognized now that Native struggles to protect land and water are everyone's struggles. And let's remember that this standoff at Standing Rock comes on the heels of years of climate justice activism, which is widely acknowledged to be led by Indigenous peoples. Standing Rock is only the most recent manifestation of that.

SOTT Comment: Read more from Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz: The colonization of America was genocidal by plan: Yes, Native Americans were the victims of genocide 
US history, as well as inherited Indigenous trauma, cannot be understood without dealing with the genocide that the United States committed against Indigenous peoples. From the colonial period through the founding of the United States and continuing in the twentieth century, this has entailed torture, terror, sexual abuse, massacres, systematic military occupations, removals of Indigenous peoples from their ancestral territories, forced removal of Native American children to military-like boarding schools, allotment, and a policy of termination. 
Within the logic of settler-colonialism, genocide was the inherent overall policy of the United States from its founding, but there are also specific documented policies of genocide on the part of US administrations that can be identified in at least four distinct periods: the Jacksonian era of forced removal; the California gold rush in Northern California; during the Civil War and in the post Civil War era of the so-called Indian Wars in the Southwest and the Great Plains; and the 1950s termination period; additionally, there is the overlapping period of compulsory boarding schools, 1870s to 1960s. The Carlisle boarding school, founded by US Army officer Richard Henry Pratt in 1879, became a model for others established by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Pratt said in a speech in 1892, 
'A great general has said that the only good Indian is a dead one. In a sense, I agree with the sentiment, but only in this: that all the Indian there is in the race should be dead. Kill the Indian in him and save the man.' Share:

DEEP UNDERGROUND BASES & THE SATANIC BREAKAWAY STATE ' Dr. Richard Sauder Published on Sep 30, 2016 With more than $6.5 TRILLION missing from the Pentagon and countless top secret deep underground military and government bases scattered across the United States, it's clear that the deep state ' or breakaway civilization ' is taking our nation, and the world, in a very dangerous direction. Author Dr. Richard Sauder joins me to discuss his studied work in this area, work which has led Sauder to conclude, 'This is a battle for the planet and the brood of vipers has set up its nest within the bowels of the so-called United States and so-called United States military and the associated alphabet soup agencies.' 
NOTE: Richard is living in Ecuador and could use our help. If you would like to donate to Richard, any amount will help. Richards writes: 
Here is how people can donate to me: 
1) People can send me Amazon.com gift cards at dr.samizdat1618@gmail.com using the link: https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Amazon-'¦ 
2) I can receive Bitcoin at: 1Dht92qEzCmvuLRKQD2MSJ1JdQ7rFRMVdA 
Those are the easiest ways. I do not have a bank account and cannot feasibly get one at present.

Kp Message 10-27-16'¦ 'Passage through the Storm Waters' 
Although I often post here a variety of 'news type' things here, there's so much that I have no understanding of, and perhaps never will. I feel I do not belong to the outer 'crap appearances', or the things that are seemingly so 'out of whack' with the Light of us all. And I also am not aligned with the idea that 'I am responsible for (and caused) it all.' Sorry'¦ no. 
This particular time upon this planet often feels like we are dealing with 'the storm waters''¦ winds blowing one way, then another way, waves coming from one direction, then another direction, and who knows what is going on with the political waves. Enough already. 
But as I've learned by bodysurfing at Sandy Beach, on a strong trades swell day, it is possible to flow with the rapid changing waves, and even catch a few, kick out, and get ready for the next one(s). And truly enjoy the experience of the 'going with the flow'. We all have tools, and we all can find our place in this time of massive transformation. 
Also I remember that even though there is this massive transformation going on, this is simply a passage'¦ we're passing through. We will not be living in 'the Storm Waters' every moment. 
There's nothing wrong with not being able to relate to this, but some can sense what's happening, and it is quite big. 
So we'll see where it all goes. In the end, BEing and SHINING our Lights, whatever they are, is perhaps the most valuable thing we can do to pass through those 'Stormy Waters'. 
Aloha, Kp

By Claire Bernish 
On Thursday, police from no less than five states sporting full riot gear and armed with heavy lethal and nonlethal weaponry, pepper spray, mace, a number of ATVs, five tanks, two helicopters, and military-equipped Humvees showed up to tear down an encampment of Standing Rock Sioux water protectors and supporters armed with '¦ nothing. 
Under orders from the now-notorious Morton County Sheriff's Office, this ridiculously heavy-handed standing army came better prepared to do battle than some actual military units fighting overseas. 
But the target of their operation ' a group of slightly more than 200 Native American water protectors and supporters opposing construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline ' never intended to do battle with the armed, taxpayer-funded, corporate-backed, state-sponsored aggressors. 
Reports vary, but no less than 141 people were arrested Thursday, and ' according to witnesses ' police marked numbers on arrestees' arms and housed them in cement-floored dog kennels , without any padding, before they were transported as far away as Fargo. 
'It goes back to concentration camp days,' asserted Oceti-Sakowin coordinator Mekasi Camp-Horinek, who, along with his mother, was marked and detained in a mesh kennel, reports the Los Angeles Times. 
Although Thursday's incident remained relatively peaceful for some time, with only shouts, chants, and occasional attempts by water protectors to convince this standing army to examine its motives and reconsider, clashes nonetheless broke out ' solely because of gratuitous police aggression. 
After facing off for a couple hours, these militant cops began closing in on the water protectors to shut down the Treaty of 1851 camp ' in reference to the Fort Laramie Treaty of that year, which established a large parcel of land designated exclusively Native American territory not to be disturbed by the U.S. government. Prior to his arrest, Camp-Horinek had established the camp, stating, as cited by Indigenous Rising : 
Today, the Oceti Sakowin has enacted eminent domain on DAPL lands, claiming 1851 treaty rights. This is unceded land. Highway 1806 as of this point is blockaded. We will be occupying this land and staying here until this pipeline is permanently stopped. We need bodies and we need people who are trained in non-violent direct action. We are still staying non-violent and we are still staying peaceful. 
Despite the water protectors' commitment to nonviolence, the militarized police response went as would be expected ' horribly awry. 
'A prayer circle of elders, including several women, was interrupted and all were arrested for standing peacefully on the public road,' stated a press release from Indigenous Environment Network . 'A tipi was erected in the road and was recklessly dismantled, despite law enforcement statements that they would merely mark the tipi with a yellow ribbon and ask its owners to retrieve it. A group of water protectors was also dragged out of a sweat lodge ceremony erected in the path of the pipeline, thrown to the ground, and arrested.' 
Claims to the contrary by Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier aside, Native American and Indigenous water protectors and supporters have refrained from violent acts on the whole, preferring instead peaceful prayer vigils and acts of civil disobedience. 
No matter how peacefully the opposition acts, armed defenders of Big Oil interests seem determined to brutalize , disrespect, and generally incite and inflict violence against those who desire unsullied water for generations to come. 
In fact, at the beginning of September, a private security firm hired by Energy Transfer Partners, the company responsible for pipeline construction, indiscriminately unleashed vicious attack dogs on water protectors, press, and supporters ' for reasons as yet unknown. 
During the savage attack, a pregnant woman, young girl, and many others suffered serious dog bites thanks to the ineptitude of the dogs' handlers. Afterward, a warrant for inciting a riot was issued Democracy Now! journalist Amy Goodman ' for doing her job, filming events as they happened ' though charges were subsequently thrown out. 
Although ETP and some law enforcement officers defended the barbarous actions of the private security mercenaries, the Guardian now reports that ' because the guards lacked proper licensing ' they could now face criminal charges. On Wednesday, the Morton County Sheriff's Office made the determination that 'dog handlers were not properly licensed to do security work in the state of North Dakota.' 
Bob Frost, owner of Ohio-based Frost Kennels, told the Guardian , 'All the proper protocols '¦ were already done. I pulled my guys out the next day because we weren't there to go to war with these protesters.' 
Frost insisted he had cooperated with authorities investigating the incident ' but the sheriff's department disagrees. Seven handlers and dogs were deployed to the scene in early September, allegedly in response to reports of trespassers; but, according to the Guardian , police have only managed to identify two people. 
The sheriff's department claims Frost has not provided necessary information, and unnamed security officials cited in the report said that 'there were no intentions of using the dogs or handlers for security work. However, because of the protest events, the dogs were deployed as a method of trying to keep the protesters under control.' 
In a statement cited by the Guardian , Morton County Captain Jay Gruebele said, 'Although lists of security employees have been provided, there is no way of confirming whether the list is accurate or if names have been purposely withheld.' 
Water protectors, in the meantime, are left to deal with absurdly disproportionate state violence ' and the altogether unacceptable, disrespectful, and demeaning insult of being relegated to dog kennels after being arrested for exercising their rights. 
As Lakota Country Times editor, Brandon Ecoffey, wrote in an editorial Thursday, 
Over the course of the last several months the abuse of detainees by Morton County Law Enforcement has overstepped every boundary guaranteed by the American constitution. Water protectors have been seen being bound and hooded by police. People are being stripped searched and abused within their jail for misdemeanor crimes. And police have employed the use of mass surveillance through drones on the protector camps. This isn't a war zone this is North Dakota.
