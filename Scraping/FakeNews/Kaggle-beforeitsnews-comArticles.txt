(Before It's News)
By Michael Synder Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote.
Most Americans don't realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney's chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state.
Unfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a Quote: from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times '¦
'I don't know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,' said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens.
Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney .
'I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney's name,' Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House.
She said that the first time she pushed 'Romney,' the machine marked 'Obama.'
So she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time.
'Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,' she told Fox News.
And we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago.
For example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012.
If that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren't even worth mentioning.
And of course this didn't just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country .
The reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again.
In Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper '¦
Shortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes 'switched.' The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday.
And Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas '¦
Gary and I went to early vote today'¦I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn't get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don't hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed.
I don't know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that.
A similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas '¦
Hey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone's vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit!
And of course they weren't the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon '¦
So is there a serious problem with the voting machines?
According to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots'¦
Chambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters .
Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a 'software update' on ES&S machines that otherwise 'omit one race' when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch.
Let's keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump's column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done.
But if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else.
Despite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are ' no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate ''¦
In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country:
Nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote
Close to 3 million registered in multiples states
Approximately 24 million'”one of every eight'”voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate
More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters
Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state
But despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled ' Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead ''¦
Almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll.
Americans overall are more confident that the nation's votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner.
Unfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media.
And the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up '¦
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia's intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election.
But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said.
Now that is a real 'conspiracy theory', and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn't so serious.
During this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it.
The American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us.
And let's watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.

CAUGHT ON TAPE: Bill Clinton Tells Alleged Mistress to Deny He Got Her State Job
NEW YORK '“ Speaking in a series of recorded phone conversations in 1991 with his alleged mistress Gennifer Flowers, Bill Clinton can be heard telling Flowers to deny that he aided her in obtaining a state job. 'If they ever asked if you'd talked to me about it, you can say no,' Clinton can be heard saying in the audio.
Listen to the audio here:
Clinton was referring to news media inquiries about Flowers' alleged affair with Clinton and Flowers' concern that the media could raise questions about how she landed her job as administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal.
Clinton can also be heard advising Flowers on how to handle a grievance filed by a woman who applied for the same position and alleged that she was more qualified that Flowers. The complainant implied that Flowers was only hired because of her alleged relationship with Clinton.
 From December 1990 to December 1991, Flowers famously recorded a series of conversations with Clinton during the period he was Governor of Arkansas and considering a run for the presidency.
On October 1991, Clinton announced his bid for the Oval Office, with rumors of extramarital affairs threatening to derail his campaign.
Flowers recently provided this reporter with complete original cassette recordings of her taped conversations with Clinton, recordings that take on renewed significance as the issue of Clinton's alleged treatment of women has reemerged during the 2016 presidential campaign.
The sections of the audio recordings related to the state job are not exclusive to Breitbart News. Those excerpts were played for the news media in 1992, one day after Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared side by side on 60 Minutes , where Bill denied a relationship with Flowers.
Clinton later admitted to one sexual encounter with Flowers in a 1998 deposition for the Paula Jones lawsuit.
The audio segments about the state job were widely reported by the news media in the 1990's. However, the details may warrant revisiting amid numerous Clinton financial scandals that have since surfaced alleging pay-for-play, including those tied to the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative.
In one section of the audio, which can be heard above, Flowers discusses the grievance filed against her and informs Clinton that she was being questioned about how she obtained the position.
Clinton says 'Good for you,' when Flowers tells him that she found out about the job from a newspaper advertisement and pursued it from there.
Here is a transcript of that part of the audio:
GF '“ But anyway, then Wednesday, there was a grievance filed in my office when I got the job by a girl who felt like she should have gotten it, a black girl named (deleted). And they called me as a witness. So I go in and uh, nothing big came of it. It's just that they were questioning me about how I found out about the job. And I said, 'Well, that personnel said it that it was a possibility there would be a position,' and then uh, 'they told me that it would be advertised in the newspaper. And it was and I pursued it from there.
BC '“ Good for you.
GF '“ Well, it caught me off guard 'cause I'¦ at first I just didn't know'¦ I just didn't expect that for some reason. I thought about a whole lot of things about my qualifications and all that business, but I didn't think about that.
BC '“ Yeah.
In the next section of the audio, Flowers expresses concern that the news media, which was asking her questions about the alleged affair, could find out about the state job.
GF: Yeah. We had a little bit of a scare recently because she had a spot on an X-ray. And she went and had it checked again and it wasn't cancer. And it's been almost, it'll be two years in May that she's now diagnosed cancer free. My stepfather has been through two angioplasties, but he's doing good. And I am, I'm really, Bill what I'm afraid of is that if somebody in the press finds out that I'm working for the state.
BC '“ Yeah.
GF '“ They're going to make a big deal of it.
BC '“ Yeah.
In a subsequent conversation, Clinton specifically counsels Flowers to say 'no' if she is asked about whether she discussed the state job with him.
Here is a transcript:
GF '“ Well the only thing that concerns me, where I'm, where I'm concerned at this point is the state job.
BC '“ Yeah. I never thought about that, but as long as you say you've just been looking for one, you'd uh, check on it. If they ever asked if you'd talked to me about it, you can say no.
GF '“ Well and I would. But I'm'¦ here is the thing I've got to consider, too, is I've gotta go in there to work every day. You know what I mean?
BC '“ Yep.
GF '“ And if, and if these people start talking or someone in the press'¦
BC '“ Well, have they been nice to you there?
GF '“ Yeah they have been. But I don't, you know, I mean, I just want you to know what's going on. And I'll be glad to hang in there.
BC '“ Has the, has the'¦
GF '“ But if it gets real'¦
BC '“ Has the grievance committee ruled yet?
GF '“ No. Not that I am aware of. Uh, I forget the guy's name that appeared to be the head of it. Dudley or Dewey. Is there a Dudley or a Dewy or somebody? Do you know?
BC '“ I don't know.
GF '“ Don Barnes was there. And of course'¦
BC '“ Is he happy with you?
GF '“ Well sure. (Laughter.) I'm good. I'm good at what I do, Bill.
BC '“ I know.
GF '“ But Don was, you know. He'¦ He pretty much'¦ When this guy was trying to beat up on me a little, said, 'hey, I don't see the relevance of this' and dadada. And then the head of the grievance committee said 'I don't either and I think we need to go on and you know go, not go along with this line of questioning.' And then that was about it except for just some other minor questions. But I found that curious that he would ask me how I found out about the job.
BC '“ Yeah.
GF '“ Now maybe at this point I'm paranoid but I mean no one has mentioned anything about it to me at all but I just found that, that I found interesting.
BC '“ Yeah.
In another conversation, Clinton tells Flowers that he will 'nose around' to see if he can find out more about the issue, and he asked her whether the person who filed the grievance was being represented by a lawyer.
BC '“ Alright. I'm gonna nose around, if I find out anything I'll call you. And meanwhile, uh, I can understand this grievance thing. I'll, I'll run that down.
GF '“ Well I don't think there'll be any problem there from what I understand, you know, that her deal was to either have my job or for them to create a position equal to mine.
BC '“ Uh huh.
GF '“ But it's my understanding that then it'll go to'¦ even if they say yes, created position for her.
BC '“ Uh huh.
GF '“ That's the same as Gennifer's. Don Barnes can always say, 'No, I won't' and period. That's it.
BC '“ That's right. I mean that's my understanding. So'¦
BC- Yeah. And then she could sue, but I doubt if she will. Was she there with a lawyer or a representative of any kind?
GF '“ She had a guy that works for the tribunal represent her which I thought was very inappropriate.
BC '“ Uh huh. Well, I guess maybe they do that for people'¦
Contacted yesterday by Breitbart News, Flowers explained why she says she turned to Clinton for help securing the state job.
She stated:
I found out my Mom had cancer and decided I wanted a regular job so I would have my weekends to spend with her. I was performing six nights a week and wouldn't of had time. I asked to get me the job and he did.
In her deposition for the Paula Jones case, Flowers detailed Clinton's alleged involvement in helping her secure the state job.
Here is her affidavit on that matter:
In early 1990 I told Bill Clinton that I wanted a job with the state. Bill Clinton told me to contact his assistant Judy Gaddy who would assist me with the application for employment. I met with Judy Gaddy in her office and she provided me with the details of what needed to be on the application. Judy Gaddy also told me to contact Clara Clark who set up a job interview for me. I was eventually employed by the state as an administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal.
Shortly after I was employed by the state, another woman who had applied for my job filed a grievance or some sort of complaint in which she alleged that she was more qualified and implied that the only reason I got the job was because I had had an affair with Bill Clinton. I was called to testify before a panel in connection with this proceeding. When I learned that I would have to testify, I did not know what to do, so I called Bill Clinton. I told him that I had been called to testify and asked what I should say. He told me to deny that we had ever had an affair. During the proceeding, when questions came up about my relationship to Bill, Don Barnes, his appointee and head of the commission, stopped the questioning.
In 1992, Michael Isikoff reported at the Washington Post that Clinton's office admitted that it helped Flowers obtain the job in June 1991, while denying allegations that Flowers was Clinton's mistress. Clinton's office maintained that Clinton only helped Flowers because the politician felt bad that she was being hounded by the media over the sex allegations.
Isikoff reported:
Gov. Bill Clinton's office said today that Clinton assigned a member of his staff to help Gennifer Flowers find a state job in September 1990 after she asked for his assistance.
Michael Gauldin, Clinton's press secretary, also released two handwritten notes he said Flowers had written to Clinton. The first, in 1986, said she would appreciate his help in finding a job. The second, dated Feb. 23, 1991, complained that the assistant assigned to help her was not being very 'successful.' '¦
Gauldin said Clinton was interested in helping her in part because he 'felt responsible for all the women' who were being hounded by reporters after they were named in an unsuccessful 1990 lawsuit in which a state employee alleged the governor had used state funds in furtherance of extramarital affairs.
In the 1986 letter, Flowers enclosed a resume, said she 'certainly enjoyed speaking with you by phone,' and said 'anything you can do' to help with employment would be 'appreciated.'
In the 1991 'Dear Bill' letter, Flowers complained that the staff aide Clinton assigned to the matter, special assistant Judy S. Caddy, 'has not been very successful in the job hunting area.'
'Bill, I've tried to explain my financial situation to you and how badly I need a job,' Flowers wrote. She said she was enclosing 'some correspondence that will be of interest to you' '“ a letter written by a lawyer she had hired threatening to sue a local radio station for repeating the 1990 allegations. The letter, which had previously been released by Clinton, said the allegations were untrue.
'Unfortunately, it looks like I will have to pursue the law suit to hopefully, get some money to live on until I can get employment,' Flowers ended the note. 'Please be in touch.'
In 1998, the Washington Post again reported on the matter:
Flowers said her affair with Clinton had been over for at least a year but that about the time of the Nichols suit, she was looking for a job and turned to the governor.
Clinton agreed to help find her a position at an Arkansas state agency, Flowers said, and enlisted a political appointee named Don Barnes. Efforts to contact Barnes last night were unsuccessful.
'I don't know Vernon Jordan, and I don't know whether he is or is not telling the truth,' Flowers said. 'But it reminds me of [1990] in regard to a position that Vernon Jordan supposedly arranged for Monica Lewinsky.'
Flowers was hired by the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal, a state agency, after an interview Barnes arranged and sat in on, according to Flowers' 1995 written account of her relationship with Clinton.

by Leon Pantenburg
I bought this knife to review. At the time of publication, Kellem Knives had no sponsorship relationship with Survivalcommonsense.com. I'm a sucker for old time knife designs, especially when they are re-created with modern materials. IMO, this makes for a time-tested, utility design that will do the job.
I particularly like the Scandinavian Puukko design, so that's why I got a Kellam Hawk.
The Kellam Hawk
The puukko is a Finnish knife, and the name lends itself to the Finnish word 'puukotta,' which means 'to stab/knife.' The prefix, 'puu' means 'wood' in Finnish. The design of the puukko is attributed to the indigenous Sami people, who created several knives to use for day to day tasks; the puukko was the smaller option, used to skin fish or animals.
'Although historical records vary, the puukko dates back about 1000 years. Both men and women carried (and carry) puukkos, although the sizes change depending on the person, as the puukko handle is meant to fit the hand size of the user. (From: EDC History: Pukko '“ A simple knife with a rich history.)
The old design is getting some attention from modern knifemakers. I recently reviewed the Battle Horse Knives Feather Stick, another knife with the Puukko design, and it worked out really well.
Here's the Hawk's specs:
Product Details:
Blade: 3'³ Carbon Steel Handle: 4.5'³ Stained Curly Birch Full Tang construction Dangler-style leather sheath Total Length : 7.5'³ Grind: Convex is my all-time, go-to favorite grind , but scandi is a close second or third. For a beginner, it is the easiest to learn to sharpen on. The bevel is sharpening guide '“ all you do is lay it flat on a whetstone and hone away.
The scandi is also a great woodworking grind, and a practical choice for someone looking for a bushcraft knife.
The Hawk handle fits my large hands very well.
Handle: I have big hands '“ size large gloves '“ and many otherwise excellent knives don't work for me because the handle is too short. I don't like two or three finger grips. IMO, they don't give a secure grip for hard work, and I'm concerned they might twist in my hand.
The 4.5-inch handle fits my hand really, really well. It is made of dyed curly birch, a common wood in Russia and Scandinavia, with nice figure. The wood makes a handle that doesn't transfer heat or cold. This is a consideration for a knife that will be used in Finland's frigid winter.
The diameter is large, which gives me a good, solid grip. When wet or slimy from cleaning fish, or bloody from butchering, the handle seems to get 'grippier.'
A comfortable, safe handle is a really important aspect of a user knife. Pretty doesn't cut it (pun intended) when there are lengthy cutting tasks to be done.
Steel: The high carbon steel holds a wicked edge. I don't know exactly what it is, but the Hawk's steel held up nicely to normal cutting and bushcraft tasks.
Traditionally, Blade materials can vary from the three-layer approach, which combines strong and flexible steels, to composite designs. Most are made with Finnish steel, Ovako 100Cr6, which is equivalent to U.S 52100 bearing steel, according to Nordic knife blog Nordiska Kniva r.
Spine: I would like the spine to be ground at a 90-degree angle, like an ice skate, so it could be used for processing tinder or scraping a ferro rod. It isn't. But a few passes on a grinder could fix that.
Sheath: The dangler-style, form-fitted leather sheath holds the knife securely. Almost too securely. It requires a slight twist to loosen the Hawk. It's a consideration '“ the knife won't fall out, but it's a two-hand job to remove it. This might be a deal-breaker for some users.
I find this annoying, but you can get used to the tight sheath.
Full tang construction with a brass bolster. I prefer a full tang on any rigid blade knife, even though I've never needed that extra strength. In fact, one of my favorite user knives, the Mora 840 Companion , has a plastic handle and a three-quarter tang.
For the strongest knife available, though, get a full tang.
Hand made in Finland.
The Hawk is a user knife, able to handle a variety of tasks.
In actual use , the Hawk lives up to the user reputation of the Puukko knives. It went along on Fremont District's Webelos Woods, a Boy Scout outing, recently. It was used to whittle sticks and do the assorted tasks associated with camping.
On the way home, on an isolated section of highway, I saw a fast-moving car hit a deer up ahead of me. The front end of the vehicle was demolished, and the hood popped. The air bag deployed and the radiator was steaming.
After checking out the driver and passenger for injuries, (they were shaken, but fine) the driver and I followed the injured buck. It had dragged itself across the road and was severely injured.
It was still alive, with two broken legs, probable internal injuries and it was in agonizing pain. We called 911. Rather than wait a possible half-hour for the Oregon State Police to arrive, we ended the deer's suffering with the only tool available '“ the Kellam Hawk.
The knife worked quickly and humanely for the sad, but necessary task.
That's the mark of a good knife. It gets the job done.
Do you need a Hawk?
Everybody needs a good knife . The Hawk is based on a proven design, with quality materials. The Hawk has proven to be a very useful tool, and one that can be used in a variety of situations, from slicing a bagel at work, to hunting and fishing.
The knife retails for $74.95, and that's a steal for a handmade knife. If you're looking for a good-looking user, that you can work hard and pass down to your grandchildren, the Hawk is a really good choice.

This article was written by Michael Snyder and originally published at Economic Collapse blog .
Editor's Comment: In particular with electronic voting, the opportunity to flip votes and steal elections is almost unstoppable and will be very difficult to hold accountable. Nonetheless, that is exactly what activists in Texas and other key states should focus on. After decades of solid 'red state' status, they are now talking openly about Hillary winning the Lone Star State and flipping it blue'¦ despite being perhaps the most despised, unlikable and untrustworthy presidential candidate in modern history.
Take a look at the electoral college, and the shades of 'blue and red states' as things have been'¦ if Team Hillary is able to steal Texas, there will be no way for Trump to win 270 electoral college, even if he wins Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and other swing states. Perhaps this has been their secret weapon all along, and the reason that she has been so arrogant throughout the entire campaign:
These are dangerous times, and the establishment '“ after systematically denying the voice of the people on many fronts '“ is now making a huge gamble at holding onto power even in the face of obvious fraud. Will there be any legitimacy left in this country? And what happens if/when this election is stolen and everyone knows it?
It Is Happening Again! Voting Machines Are Switching Votes From Donald Trump To Hillary Clinton
by Michael Snyder
Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote.
Most Americans don't realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney's chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state.
Unfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a Quote: from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times '¦
'I don't know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,' said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens.
Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney .
'I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney's name,' Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House.
She said that the first time she pushed 'Romney,' the machine marked 'Obama.'
So she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time.
'Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,' she told Fox News.
And we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago.
For example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012.
If that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren't even worth mentioning.
And of course this didn't just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country .
The reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again.
In Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper '¦
Shortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes 'switched.' The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday.
And Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas '¦
Gary and I went to early vote today'¦I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn't get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don't hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed.
I don't know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that.
A similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas '¦
Hey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone's vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit!
And of course they weren't the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon '¦
So is there a serious problem with the voting machines?
According to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots'¦
Chambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters .
Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a 'software update' on ES&S machines that otherwise 'omit one race' when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch.
Let's keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump's column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done.
But if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else.
Despite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are 'no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate''¦
In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country:
Nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote
Close to 3 million registered in multiples states
Approximately 24 million'”one of every eight'”voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate
More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters
Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state
But despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled ' Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead ''¦
Almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll.
Americans overall are more confident that the nation's votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner.
Unfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media.
And the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up '¦
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia's intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election.
But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said.
Now that is a real 'conspiracy theory', and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn't so serious.
During this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it.
The American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us.
And let's watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.

A leading US senator: US Supporting War in Syria
A leading US senator said the war in Syria would have been over by now if the US had put an end to its intervention when Russia entered the war-ravaged country.
'If the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,' republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
'If we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia'¦ would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.'
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are 'thoroughly integrated.'
'They really are one and the same, they're part of the same army,' he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency's investigation in 2013, which showed Washington's ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move 'evolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.'
'We do it indirectly because it's unlawful to do it directly,' he said, adding that the US keeps 'extremely violent organizations'¦ off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.'
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the 'bad guys,' while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a 'clear understanding of what's happening over there.'
'Sometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment'¦ but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.'
He further warned that the US itself could be 'threatened,' arguing that, 'if Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.'
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East 'axis of evil,' naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and 'particularly' Turkey over their support for terrorism.
'Probably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,' he asserted, describing the three countries as 'the primary force behind the terrorist movement.'
'Turkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,' he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
'And now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,' he noted, further adding that Erdogan 'has made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.'
'He has become more and more aggressive; he's crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he's now a total dictator. He's a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter'¦ This is our great ally; we're allied with a man who would be Hitler.'
He also blasted Washington's alliance with Saudi Arabia, 'where women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man's permission; they can't drive a car!'
'Somehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,' he said ironically, calling it 'bizarre.'
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, 'God bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,' despite being a 'tiny little, poor nation.'
'I think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,' he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
'We don't pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they're our good allies,' he said, concluding that Washington is on a 'suicidal course of action.'
'Saudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.'Black referred to the Western media's portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, 'The fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.'
He exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a 'reflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.'

Here's a letter to the Wall Street Journal :
Wilbur Ross's and Peter Navarro's defense of Donald Trump's economic policies is mostly a mash of bunkum (' A Vote for Trump Is a Vote for Growth ,' Oct. 26). Consider this claim: 'Donald Trump will cut taxes, reduce regulation '¦ and eliminate our trade deficit through muscular trade negotiations that increase exports, [and] reduce imports'¦.'
Cut taxes? Bunk. Trump famously promises to raise taxes on Americans who buy imports. Reduce regulation? Rubbish. Trump promises more government intrusions into Americans' commerce with foreigners.
As for 'eliminating' our trade deficit, Trump might indeed succeed on that front. But such 'success' would be regrettable, for it would be the inevitable outcome of the American economy being made an unattractive destination for investment. (Ross and Navarro seem to be unaware that to 'eliminate our trade deficit' '“ such as was done, for example, during the Great Depression '“ is to eliminate net contributions by foreigners to increasing the size of America's capital stock.)
But Trump's most absurd promise is to enrich Americans by increasing exports and reducing imports. Imports are what we voluntarily buy and exports are the price we pay. Therefore, a policy meant to increase exports while decreasing imports is a policy meant to force Americans to pay more to foreigners and to receive less in return '“ a decidedly unartful deal the architect of which would deserved to be fired.
But the Trump camp's confusion runs even more deeply. Exporting for Americans is worthwhile only because it supplies us with the means to purchase imports, either currently or in the future. So a policy that aims both to increase exports and to decrease imports is akin to a policy that aims both to increase people's spending power and to decrease it. It's a policy meant to give Americans greater means for acquiring imports as it simultaneously strips Americans of the freedom to use those means. It's the economic policy equivalent of an attempt to square a circle.

This is a good article :
'When Donald Trump rode down an escalator at Trump Tower to launch his presidential campaign in June 2015, he began galvanizing a populist version of the Republican Party.
But he didn't create it.
The GOP that carried Mr. Trump to the presidential nomination was formed by waves of new voters who washed onto Republican shores in the last four decades: George Wallace Southerners, Ronald Reagan Democrats, Pat Buchanan pitchfork populists and tea-party foot soldiers.
The Republican establishment was happy to have the votes of these newcomers, many from America's working class, and accommodated their cultural preferences on social issues from guns to abortion to gay marriage. What the establishment didn't do was adjust the GOP's economic approach to match the populist impulses'”or even seem to consider such a shift necessary. '¦'
Rich Lowry put it well here :
'Our basic argument about Trump is simple and unassailable: He is a populist, not a conservative. Conservatism has always had a populist element, but it has been tethered to conservatism's animating causes of liberty, limited government and the Constitution. Trump inveighs against elites and tramples on political pieties, but these causes are afterthoughts to him, at best.'
Ross Douthat put it better here:
'Sometimes this interdependency has worked out well. At its peaks of political success, the conservative intelligentsia has channeled and directed populism, responding to grass-roots passions without being ruled by them.'
The goal of the conservative intelligentsia has always been to CUCK the populist vote so that all of its anger and energy can be 'tethered' or 'channeled' into advancing the conservative agenda (read: classical liberal agenda) of the 'governing wing' of the Republican Party. The role of populist voters in the GOP is to show up on election day and vote for a handpicked establishment candidate like Mitt Romney or Â¡Jeb!
In this way, the conservatives can pass new free-trade deals for their corporate backers in the US Chamber of Commerce, start massive new destructive, unending wars in the Middle East, and keep the border wide open so that an endless influx of Third World cheap labor can further enrich the plutocracy. They figured all those yokels would just keep voting for them indefinitely because Democrats want to abort babies and seize guns.
Give them lip service! Give them token gestures! Give them round after round of failure theater! You know, it kind of worked too until their whole signaling structure broke down. That's what happens when an elite loses its legitimacy. To borrow an analogy, the falcon doesn't respond to the Falconer anymore and the elite falls.
It is only a matter of time.

It is fun to look at polls, and using such data, decide which candidate will win which state, and ultimately, which candidate will win the electoral college. A lot of people and organizations do that, and for this reason, I don't. I do not have access to polls that no one else sees. Were I to use polling data to directly predict outcomes per state, I'd use a method like that used by FiveThirtyEight, and probably come up with similar results. How boring. It would be a waste of my time to try to replicate the excellent work done by Nate Silver and his team.
Back during the Democratic Primaries, I decided that I wanted to get a handle on which candidate was likely to win, fairly early on. The polling based estimates were inadequate because most states simply didn't have polling data that early in the process. So, I invented an alternative method, which made certain estimates of how voters with different ethnic identities would vote. That method accurately predicted several primary outcomes, outperforming the poll based methods such as those used by FiveThirtyEight.
After a while, enough primaries had been carried out that I could switch methods slightly. Using the same exact model, but primed with the results of prior primaries (that year) rather than my estimates of voter behavior, I used the ethnic distribution data for each state to predict the outcome of upcoming primary contests.
Once again, my method was very accurate, and once again, it out performed the polling based methods.
So, recently, I've tried to apply a similar method to estimating the electoral outcome for this year's presidential race. But, it is impossible to use the same exact method because the entire thing happens all on one day. I can't use the election results from a handful of states to estimate the likely future outcomes in other states.
I recognize that polling data is very limited on a national level. Things happen during an election season that probably change people's likely voting behavior, especially among independents. Solid states are rarely polled, and small states, swing or not, are rarely polled. Many polls are of low quality. Right now, for instance, fewer than half of the states have polls that were a) taken fully after the final POTUS debate and b) have an A- or better rating from FiveThirtyEight. If I allow the use of B and occasional C ratings for recent polls, and allow a few polls to include periods of time prior to the last POTUS debate, but only in states that are very strongly in favor of one candidate or the other (and thus likely to not move anyway), I can find 32 states that have sort of usable polling data. Interestingly, states with some of the more controversial changes happening, like Utah and Iowa, are not adequately polled.
In order to apply a model like the one I used in the Primaries to the current election, I used the 32 states for which there was somewhat acceptable recent polling data to inform the model (to calculate the regression coefficients) in order to then, separately, predict the likely voting behavior (Trump vs. Clinton) in all of the states.
Before I show you the map, however, I need to discuss something else.
About a week ago the press, especially the somewhat more left leaning press, and various commenters, seeing much reaction to a series of events beginning with the NYT release of Trump's tax return and ending with the final POTUS debate, events which sandwiched the sexual assault tapes and accusations, collectively decided that a huge gap between Clinton and Trump was rapidly opening up and the race would end with a double digit spread, an electoral rout, and a big party.
Soon after, I pointed out that this may not be correct. That polling data seemed to show, rather, that there was an expansion of the difference between the two candidates followed by a re-closing of the gap, with Clinton still leading but by about as much as before this temporary shift. To this I added a concern. If too many people assumed that the race was over and in the double digit range, perhaps there could be a GOTV backlash effect, or a funding effect, that would shift things to within shooting distance for Trump.
I was not alone in thinking this, and I was probably right. The GOP sunk, via pacs, 25 million dollars into Senate races in response to the Democrats shifting from the national race to the Senate, which was followed by the Democrats shifting back to the national race in certain states, presumably recognizing that the polls were artificially spread. Indeed, some who criticized (arguing mainly from incredulity and good wishes) my admonition noted, correctly, that some of that narrowing was because a bunch of right-leaning polls had come out all at once. This is true, but it ignores that a bunch of left-leaning polls had made the formation of the Great Gap of GOP Defeat look a lot bigger than it ever really was.
I say all this as part one of my preparation for what I'm going to tell you below, which is not the news you want to hear. Part two is some logic I'd like to bludgeon you with.
Consider these points:
1) True Trump supporters could give a rat's ass about sexual assault, poor debate performance, or tax forms. Donald Trump was correct when he said, weeks ago, now forgotten, that he could gun someone down on the streets of Manhattan and he would not lose support form his base. These people did not abandon him when he was heard to talk about sexual assault. If anything, they were energized by it. And, I'm talking about something just shy of 40% of the voters. We live in a barely civilized asshole country.
2) Please tell me exactly which Hillary Clinton supporters, who were going to vote for Clinton over Trump all along, are NOW going to pick Clinton (if polled or on voting day) that change from not being Clinton supporters to being Clinton supporters? In other words (this is a somewhat subtle point) which people who hated Trump became True Haters of Trump after the sexual assault thing? Almost none. They were already there.
3) The third category of people, the undecideds (who are only lying about being undecided, in most cases) and the so-called 'reasonable Republicans' (of which there are very, very few), who could conceivably shift from Trump to Clinton are going to divide their voting activities between Johnson, a write in (as they are being advised by Republican leaders in some cases) or simply staying home.
In other words, over the last few weeks, no source has emerged that hands Secretary Clinton more electoral votes than she probably had about a month ago, and Trump is not going to have any, or at least not many, electoral votes go away.
Those observations (part one) and that logic (part two) cause me to be utterly unsurprised to find out that an analysis of the electoral map I did on October 16th and one I did today do not show Clinton pulling farther ahead. In fact, the two analyses have Clinton being less far ahead than Trump now than ten days ago. The difference is in Ohio (shifting from Clinton to Trump) which is almost certainly going to happen, and North Carolina (which shifted from Clinton to Trump in this analysis) which seems much less likely to happen, and Arizona shifting from Clinton (that was probably wishful thinking) to Trump.
The point here is this, plain and simple. An analysis using a technique that has worked very well for me in the past shows that the difference between that moment of Maximal Clintonosity and today is plus or minus a couple of state. In other words, not different. Maybe a little worse. Really, about the same.
Here's the current map:
Obviously, I will be watching for more data over the next few days. I assume there will be a spate of polls as we approach November 8th (the day Democrats vote. Republicans vote on the 28th of November). If so, then there will be convergence between my method of calibration and my method of calculation, and the model will consume itself by the tail and become very accurate at the same time.
But between now and then, perhaps that very small number of polls that are both recent and high quality will grow a bit more and I can do this again and resolve those closer states.
By the way, the 'swing states' according to my model, the states where things are close, are Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia of those now in the Trump column. Those are indeed swing states. Numerically, the close states that are in the Clinton column are Virginia, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania.

(Before It's News) 43 here, 109 there and pretty soon 443 employees are dismissed Bank has to file 'WARN notices' with New York state agency The first 'plant layoff' notice came in February: 43 people would lose their jobs.
The second arrived six weeks later, increasing the cuts to 109 workers. Then a third, in April, for 146 more. And a fourth, in June: 98. Three more notices followed, including 20 dismissals announced last week.
The 'plant' in question '” Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Like all big companies in New York State, the firm is required to file a 'WARN notice' with state authorities when it plans to shed large numbers of employees as part of a plant closing, or 'mass layoffs' involving 250 or more. Employers also must inform the state of smaller reductions under certain circumstances, and Goldman Sachs cited a 'plant layoff' in each case. Last week's notice brings this year's job-cut tally to 443.With the run of notices, seven since the start of the year, the bank has signaled its intention to dismiss hundreds of employees in New York without placing a single, headline-grabbing number on the overall reduction, already its largest since 2008. The company's approach differs from competitors, including Morgan Stanley, who have shown a preference for larger, one-time cuts.
Big Number
'When there's a big number, people right away get that something is happening at that firm '” it's a negative,' said Jeanne Branthover, a partner at New York-based executive-search firm DHR International. 'This is more, 'We're having layoffs and we don't want to explain it.' It's more under the radar screen.'
The 20 people in the latest reduction were notified either this month or last, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing staffing decisions. The terminations will take place between Nov. 7 and Jan. 5, according to the notice posted on the state Labor Department's website. The workers aren't represented by a union.
Gena Palumbo, a managing director and the bank's global head of employment law, is the sole Goldman Sachs contact listed on each of this year's WARN notices. In 2008, the firm dismissed 900 people in New York in two different sets of cuts as the financial crisis raged. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs set aside $9.2 billion for compensation and benefits this year through September, 13 percent less than the first nine months of last year. Total employees, including consultants and part-time workers, fell 5.4 percent to 34,900.
While Goldman prefers a scalpel, its rival Morgan Stanley wielded an ax. That firm took steps to shrink in the fourth quarter, cutting 1,200 employees, including about 25 percent of the fixed-income trading staff, or about 470 traders and salesmen. When asked about how Morgan Stanley decided to make the changes, trading chief Ted Pick said he favored a bold move.
'We took the view of taking tough medicine,' Pick, 47, said in February.
Slower Approach
Goldman Sachs's slower approach may reflect a desire to avoid cutting too much if trading or dealmaking comes roaring back. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein has spoken about staying nimble to respond to revenue opportunities when they arise.
It also may reflect an outlook that got cloudier as the year progressed. In January, a person familiar with the firm's thinking said Goldman Sachs was mulling cuts to more than 5 percent of its fixed-income staff. By March, that would expand to more than 5 percent but less than 10 percent. And by May, 10 percent.
The job cuts continued after first-quarter revenue was the worst for the start of a year in Blankfein's decade-long tenure. While trading business bounced back in the second and third quarters, total trading revenue for the first nine months declined 11 percent from last year.
The WARN notices don't capture firings outside New York and they don't include voluntary retirements. More than a half-dozen partners have left Goldman Sachs this year, according to internal memos obtained by Bloomberg.
'Everything Goldman does is scrutinized,' Branthover said. 'This may be a signal or a sign that there are changes being made internally, or there are businesses and areas that are not performing satisfactorily. I would keep an eye on it.'

An NSA Whistleblower says that Hillary Clinton's deleted emails are easily accessible by the NSA and FBI should they desire to look at them, and he suggests that the hacks on the Democratic National Committee's server was not done by Russia, as many pundits are claiming, but possibly by a disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker.
William Binney, the architect of the NSA's surveillance program, resigned on October 31, 2001, after working for the agency for more than 30 years. He thinks that an intelligence worker may have hacked into the DNC emails due to concern about Hillary Clinton's disregard of national security in her use of a personal email server and her continued lies about her activity. Once accessed, there's no telling where the information could have gone.
The 'Putin did it' story is a fable used to sway voters towards Clinton's war-driven agenda.
On a talk radio show, he mentioned that there are numerous questions that are not being answered about the hacked DNC emails and the network log available to the NSA.
Binney explains that there was no evidence tying the alleged Russian hacks to Wikileaks, and he says that they would have access to this information through the network logs. 'So, if the FBI really wanted them, they can go into that database and get them right now,' he said.
He finds their reluctance to speak to this matter highly suspicious.

Remember when the media, Barack Obama, and Democrats were finger-wagging and tut-tutting Republicans for saying Obamacare was going to be a failure? Remember how Obama said premiums were going to go down?
For the last 18 months, Obama and his fellow Democrats have been reduced to bragging about how many people are now 'covered' by health insurance as if it was some real accomplishment. Two points to consider:
It is mandatory. People are merely obeying the law and getting a plan. The law's intention was for healthcare coverage to be more affordable, and that has not happened. Insurers are recognizing this problem. Younger people would rather be in a position where they pay the fine (which the administration is not enforcing), rather than the out of pocket costs for a health care plan. The CEO of Aetna said as much:
Healthier people will avoid buying Affordable Care Act health insurance plans as premiums climb, threatening the stability of the market, Aetna Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said.
'As the rates rise, the healthier people pull out because the out-of-pocket costs aren't worth it,' Bertolini said at Bloomberg's The Year Ahead Summit in New York. 'Young people can do the math. Gas for the car, beer on Fridays and Saturdays, health insurance.'
Premiums for health plans sold to individuals under the ACA, known as Obamacare, are going up by about 25 percent on average for next year. Bertolini said that as costs rise, more individuals will decide not to buy health plans. That'll push premiums even higher, unless a new president and lawmakers can find fixes for the new markets created by the 2010 health law.
The question over whether such problems get fixed is all dependent upon whether or no the President, be it Obama or Clinton, recognizes what divided government means. It is not to say, as President Obama believes, 'Here is what I need, now pass it so I can sign it.' President Obama or President Clinton must recognize divided government means everything is on the table at the start of negotiations , not just what the President wants.

( The Real Agenda News ) More details have emerged about the never ending levels of corruption among the DNC, the Obama White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign, as a result of James O'Keefe's Project Veritas' investigation.
Corrupt practices go from promoting seemingly harmless campaigns to have people dressed as ducks at Trump rallies to collusion between the Clinton campaign, the DNC and the non-profit organization Americans United for Change.
In the third video put out by Project Veritas, Hillary's cohorts confess how they managed to coordinate with her campaign and the DNC to set up what can be described at the very least as provocative moves to get the Trump campaign in trouble and to have the corrupt mainstream media cover the events while blaming Trump for violent outbursts outside his rallies.
As we learned from the previous two videos, it was the Clinton campaign itself the one using agent provocateurs to cause violence outside Trump rallies as these agents disguised themselves as Bernie Sanders' followers.
In his second video, James O'Keefe showed how the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign, hire operatives to successfully carry out commit voter fraud on a massive scale.
Scott Foval, who has since been fired, admits that the Democrats have been rigging elections for fifty years.
In his first video, Rigging the Election '“ Video I: Clinton Campaign and DNC Incite Violence at Trump Rallies, O'Keefe showed how second and third parties associated with the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, were responsible for violence and attacks on Trump supporters all over the country.
As we said before, the veil of corruption that surrounds the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party continues to fall and people can easily see what is behind their fake progressive and fake liberal masks.

Iraqi Analyst Discloses Plot to Transfer Al-Baghdadi to Libya
A prominent Iraqi military analyst disclosed that Riyadh and Ankara had hatched plots to transfer ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from Mosul to Libya but the massive presence of the popular forces and Russian fighter jets at the bordering areas of Iraq and Syria dissuaded them.

He added that the ISIL concluded that transferring al-Baghdadi through Tal Afar region to Raqqa in Syria is also impossible given the massive presence of Hashd al-Sha'abi (popular forces) in the Southern front near Be'aaj district, Northwest of the Iraqi province of Nineveh as well as the numerous flights done by the Russian fighter jets over the Syrian bordering areas with Iraq.

Commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Major General Qassem Soleimani has arrived in Hashd al-Sha'abi (popular forces) operations room in Mosul to play his advisory role in anti-ISIL campaign in Iraq, Arab media reported on Wednesday.
'Hashd al-Sha'abi will soon start its operations in Western Mosul to cut the ISIL's supply routes to Syria and defuse the US plots to postpone the popular forces' participation in the Mosul operations, and General Soleimani has also joined them as a military advisor,' the Arabic-language al-Akhbar said quoting renowned Iraqi figures.
No other source has yet confirmed the report.
Washington is pressuring Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi not to allow Hashd al-Sha'abi forces to participate in the Mosul liberation operations.
Spokesman of the Iraqi popular forces Ahmad al-Assadi had confirmed in August that General Soleimani would play a major role in operations to liberate Mosul, stressing that his country is in dire need of Iranian military advisors.
'The presence of Brigadier-General Soleimani in the operations to free Mosul and Nineveh province is necessary and General Soleiman is the greatest advisor that has helped the Iraqi government in the war against the ISIL,' al-Assadi told FNA.
'Hajj Qassem Soleimani is one of the most important military advisors of the Islamic Republic of Iran who is in Iraq at the invitation, demand and agreement of the Iraqi government,' he added.

In relevant remarks in June, Iraqi Foreign Minister Ebrahim al-Jafari underlined that General Soleimani is in Iraq to help the country in campaign against terrorism after receiving Baghdad's rigid request.
'General Soleimani is in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government to provide military counseling to the Iraqi forces,' the Arabic-language Sumeria news channel Quote: d al-Jafari as saying.
Also in June, Hashd al-Sha'abi Commander Abu Mehdi al-Mohandes underlined that General Soleimani is helping the Iraqi forces in their campaign against terrorism upon a request by the Iraqi government.
'The Iranian advisors, headed by dear brother Qassem Soleimani, have been beside us since the start of war and his presence has happened upon the demand of the Iraqi government and agreement of the Armed Forces' top commander,' Mohandes said in an interview with Sumeria news channel.
He, meantime, said that the Iraqi nation is able to kick the terrorists out of Iraq with the possibilities in their hands now, adding that Hashd al-Sha'abi doesn't have any political plan and merely supports the political process.

UNIONDALE, NEW YORK '” Sahn Ward Coschignano, PLLC has announced that Christian Browne, a Partner with the Firm, successfully appealed a New York State Supreme Court decision that dismissed a restaurant's request to annul a five-year durational limit on the eatery's parking lot that extends into the Town's Residence District.
On April 22, 2015, the Board of Zoning and Appeals (BZA) imposed a five-year durational limit on an approval that allows Mim's Restaurant to provide parking in a part of its property that is within a residential zoning district.
The restaurant then commenced an Article 78 proceeding, seeking to annul the durational limit. On November 18, 2015, the New York State Supreme Court, Nassau County, denied the petition and dismissed the proceeding.
On October 19, 2016, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department, overturned the lower court's decision. In its ruling, the Appellate Court stated that the BZA does not have the authority to impose the durational limit on the restaurant's parking lot because the Town Code does not confer any such power to limit the life of the approval.
Zoning boards routinely impose durational limits on various types of approvals given for commercial uses. Businesses often object to these time restrictions as being unfair and unnecessary burdens on their property rights because, by limiting the life of a zoning approval, zoning boards force businesses to regularly seek renewed permission for their ongoing operations.
'We are pleased with the Court's decision,' Mr. Browne said. 'We believe it strikes the proper balance between the rights of a commercial property owner and the need for the Town to protect the interest of the surrounding neighborhood.'
Nicholas J. Cappadora, an Associate with the Firm, assisted Mr. Browne on the case.

In a recent post, 'Why do you believe what you believe' we said:
'Why do you know the sun causes skin cancer? You know it because years ago you read it in, or heard it from, a trusted source . Then you read and heard it often again, and the repetition caused you to believe it more and more until you know it.
The combination of 'trusted source' and 'repetition' inserts belief into our minds , and once there, it may be difficult to dislodge '” unless we are exposed to a more trusted source plus repetition.
As you know, consuming saturated fat and cholesterol increases your risk of heart disease, while sugar does not. You have heard this from many trusted sources and it has been repeated endlessly in all forms of communication.
ScienceNews Magazine, October 15, 2016, Sugar industry sought to sugarcoat causes of heart disease
Payments revealed to authors of influential 1967 report touting fat and cholesterol as problems, by LAURA BEIL
Using records unearthed from library storage vaults, researchers recently revealed that the sugar industry paid nutrition experts from Harvard University to downplay studies linking sugar and heart disease.
Although the incident happened in the 1960s, it appears to have helped redirect the scientific narrative for decades.
Harvard University '” what could be a more trusted source than Harvard University?
Note however, that Harvard University does not conduct research, nor does Harvard University verify the findings of research.
Research is done by people, employees of Harvard , and being employees of Harvard gives those researchers no special insight or virtue.
Yet the mere association with the name 'Harvard,' implies intelligence and academic trustworthiness.
The documents show that the Sugar Research Foundation paid professors who wrote a two-part review in 1967 in the New England Journal of Medicine . That report was highly skeptical of the evidence linking sugar to cardiovascular problems but accepting of the role of fat.
The now-deceased professors' overall conclusion left 'no doubt' that reducing the risk of heart disease was a matter of reducing saturated fat and cholesterol, according to researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, who published their report online September 12 in JAMA Internal Medicine .
Now, we have the University of California, San Francisco, another trusted source, impugning the trusted Harvard results.
The sugar industry helped deflect the way the research was developing,' says study coauthor Cristin Kearns, a dentist at UCSF's Institute for Health Policy Studies.
The belief in sugar's innocence, and the sugar industry's profit motive, were so powerful, it took a dentist, not a cardiologist to uncover apparently biased results from what ostensibly was a heart study.
Following the publication of the Harvard report, fat and cholesterol went on to hijack the scientific agenda for decades, and even led to a craze of low-fat foods that often added sugar.
It was only in 2015 that dietary guidelines finally made a strong statement to limit sugar. Researchers writing this year in Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases note that current studies estimate that diets high in added sugars carry a three times higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease.
( The Sugar Association says in a statement on its website that ' the last several decades of research have concluded that sugar does not have a unique role in heart disease. ' )
Is this an example of deception with a true statement ?
Yes, unfortunately, the last several decades of research did absolve sugar from blame, and what does 'unique role in heart disease' really mean? If sugar causes heart disease, is that a 'unique role'?
The Sugar Association's statement acknowledged the secret deal occurred, but pointed out that 'when the studies in question were published, funding disclosures and transparency standards were not the norm they are today.'
Translation: The research lied, but back then, we didn't have to reveal the lie. So, it's O.K.
Journals now require all authors to list conflicts of interest, especially funding from a source has a vested interest in the outcome.
While a modern researcher could not take corporate money, even for speaking fees, without disclosure, the influences may be more subtle, he says. 'We're not talking about making up data, but perhaps influencing how a research question is framed.'
Revealing the source of funding doesn't eliminate bias. And, though one reasonably may conclude that a high percentage of private funding comes from sources with an ax to grind, that doesn't necessarily mean the research results are misleading.
But, such funding leads to the question: 'What happens to results that disagree with the benefactor's purpose?
If several, slightly different pieces of research show that sugar has an adverse effect on heart health, and one shows it doesn't, what happens to all the negative research?
Andy Bellatti, cofounder and strategic director of Dietitians for Professional Integrity says that researchers don't necessarily want to be cozy with industry, but sometimes turn to commercial sources because non-biased research money is lacking .
'The reason the food industry is able to do this is because there is such little public funding for nutrition and disease.'
Here is yet another example, among hundreds, of how cuts in federal deficit spending hurt America , though often benefitting big business.
And what does the need for an organization titled, ' Dietitians for Professional Integrity' tell you about today's food research?
The scientific community should not reject industry money wholesale, says John Sievenpiper, a physician and nutrition researcher at the University of Toronto.
He believes that any scientist who takes industry money should adhere to an even higher standard of openness, including releasing study protocols ahead of time so reviewers can make sure the research question was not changed midstream to favor a certain conclusion.
Bottom line:
For many years, your belief in 'benign sugar' was created by 'trusted sources' and repetition. As with privately owned banks , the profit motive encourages unethical behavior. Corporations do not fund research out of generosity. They consider research to be part of their marketing efforts. Negative results often are twisted or hidden. Researchers, whether employed by Harvard University, the University of California, a private organization, or working alone, all can be swayed , consciously or not, to tilt their interpretations in favor of the money supply. Cuts in federally funded Research & Development grants are misguided if the primary purpose is to 'save the federal government money' or to 'make government smaller' (a huge, often unacknowledged disadvantage of libertarianism). While the federal government has political motives, it does not have a profit motive , and that alone helps make it a more trusted source for food & drug research than is private industry.

Ivanka Trump is going to have to back off from her father's campaign, because the hateful and sexist rhetoric of Donald Trump is severely hurting Ivanka's clothing and lifestyle brand.
Women are turning on Ivanka Trump as she continues supporting her father despite allegations of sexual harassment against him and a 2005 audio tape capturing him bragging in lewd terms that he can do whatever he wants to women.
Now, the growing group of women are boycotting her line of clothing, jewelry, perfume and accessories sold as part of the Ivanka Trump Collection. They are also calling on the stores that carry the brand, including Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and Macy's, to stop selling it.
It has even created its own hashtag, #Ivankant, as well as #GrabYourWallet.
From The Daily Mail :
'If Ivanka Trump had distanced herself from the campaign I would not be boycotting her,' Shannon Coulter, who called on Americans to boycott the brand earlier this month, told the Guardian.
'But something changed for me when that tape was released.'
Coulter, who shared her own experience of sexual harassment at the hands of a male superior, launched the hashtag 'GrabYourWallet' on October 11, a reference to Trump's offensive 'grab them by the p***y' remark from the audio tape.
The problem obviously for Ivanka, is that Donald Trump's base, for the most part, doesn't shop at Bloomingdale's or Nordstrom, which are two of the largest stores that carry her clothing line, along with Macy's.
What are your thoughts, should Ivanka's business be hurt because of the actions of her father?
From Politico:
The New York Times cited a deposition from a woman who claimed that Donald Trump groped her under the table decades ago, but the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is certainly not a groper, his daughter said Wednesday.
'Look, I'm not in every interaction my father has, but he's not a groper,' Ivanka Trump said in an interview broadcast Wednesday on 'CBS This Morning.' 'It's not who he is. And I've known my father obviously my whole life and he has total respect for women.'
The billionaire businessman launched a Twitter salvo the 'failing' newspaper for its 'false, malicious & libelous story,' catapulting the story to become the newspaper's most popular of the year, according to assistant news editor Theodore Kim.
'”
Ivanka Trump said she read the Sunday cover story and 'found it to be pretty disturbing, based on the facts as I know them, and obviously I very much know them' as a daughter and an executive who's worked alongside him for more than a decade.
'I was bothered by it, but it's largely been discredited since,' she said, referring to Brewer Lane's criticism of the report. Brewer Lane, the ex-girlfriend whose first run-in with Donald Trump was used as the lead anecdote for the article, titled 'Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private,' accused the newspaper of putting a negative connotation on her words.
'Most of the time when stories are inaccurate they're not discredited, and I will be frustrated by that, but in this case I think they went so far,' Ivanka Trump continued. 'They had such a strong thesis and created facts to reinforce it and, you know, I think that narrative has been playing out now and there's backlash in that regard.'

Obvious political double standards
When it comes to scandal-plagued and utterly dishonest Hillary Clinton, the U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch clandestinely meets on the tarmac of Sky Harbor airport for a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with Hill's husband Bill aboard a private jet '” ostensibly to discuss grandchildren.
And, though FBI Director James Comey found compelling evidence of concerning issues in Hillary Clinton's use of multiple private email servers, he concluded that he would not recommend charges against her, though he conceded Clinton and her aides were 'extremely careless' in handling classified information. Comey refused to recommend an indictment against Hillary Clinton, despite 'evidence' she violated laws pertaining to the handling of classified information, jeopardizing U.S. national security. These breaches occurred during her term as Secretary of State. 'There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that information,' Comey acknowledged.
Additionally, Comey noted that other individuals in a similar situation would not necessarily be let off the hook with no charges, and would probably face penalties. 'But that's not what we're deciding now,' he glibly fed us, the sheeple. 'We are expressing to Justice our view that no charges be made in this case.'
'Justice,' of course, is U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch of the tarmac meeting fame. Addressing the people of the United States, the FBI director actually said that 'no outside influence of any kind was brought to bear' on the investigation. He neglected to mention the inappropriate meeting between former president Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch aboard a private jet.
Hillary Clinton is free to run for the U.S. Presidency, guaranteeing Obama's third term.
Here in Arizona, we have what clearly appears to be a personal vendetta carried out by a federal judge timed to coincide with the General Election in which popular Sheriff Joe Arpaio is on the ballot running for a seventh term. He was formally charged Tuesday with criminal contempt of court for ignoring U.S. District Judge Murray Snow's order in a three-year old racial-profiling case. Arpaio acknowledged violating Snow's order but insists the breach wasn't intentional
Arpaio's challenger in the race is once again rough 'er up Democrat Paul Penzone, funded by multi-billionaire Socialist George Soros, who is contemptuous of national borders. Soros also funds Hillary Clinton and John McCain .
If convicted, Sheriff Arpaio could face up to six months in jail. A misdemeanor conviction would not bar Arpaio from serving as sheriff.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office denied CEI's May 5, 2016 request for any Common Interest Agreements, which was made under New York's Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). His office claimed the records are exempt from disclosure.
CEI is seeking all Common Interest Agreements entered into by the Office of the Attorney General and which are signed by, mention or otherwise include the AGs for other states or territories, as well as certain environmental activists. CEI suspects that these agreements may be a pretext for simply shielding documents from public disclosure.
After supplying a Common Interest Agreement to CEI, AG Schneiderman moved to dismiss our FOIL case against his office. Our October 26, 2016 filing opposes that motion to dismiss on the grounds that there could be more relevant documents yet to be produced, and we also want the common interest agreement ruled invalid, so that it stops functioning as a shield against disclosure of information by AGs.

A leading US senator: US Supporting War in Syria
A leading US senator said the war in Syria would have been over by now if the US had put an end to its intervention when Russia entered the war-ravaged country.
'If the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,' republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
'If we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia'¦ would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.'
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are 'thoroughly integrated.'
'They really are one and the same, they're part of the same army,' he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency's investigation in 2013, which showed Washington's ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move 'evolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.'
'We do it indirectly because it's unlawful to do it directly,' he said, adding that the US keeps 'extremely violent organizations'¦ off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.'
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the 'bad guys,' while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a 'clear understanding of what's happening over there.'
'Sometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment'¦ but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.'
He further warned that the US itself could be 'threatened,' arguing that, 'if Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.'
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East 'axis of evil,' naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and 'particularly' Turkey over their support for terrorism.
'Probably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,' he asserted, describing the three countries as 'the primary force behind the terrorist movement.'
'Turkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,' he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
'And now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,' he noted, further adding that Erdogan 'has made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.'
'He has become more and more aggressive; he's crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he's now a total dictator. He's a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter'¦ This is our great ally; we're allied with a man who would be Hitler.'
He also blasted Washington's alliance with Saudi Arabia, 'where women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man's permission; they can't drive a car!'
'Somehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,' he said ironically, calling it 'bizarre.'
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, 'God bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,' despite being a 'tiny little, poor nation.'
'I think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,' he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
'We don't pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they're our good allies,' he said, concluding that Washington is on a 'suicidal course of action.'
'Saudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.'Black referred to the Western media's portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, 'The fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.'
He exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a 'reflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.'

However, it is clear Hillary does not have custody of her eye movements. In the first video you can stop at 7s, 15s, and 31s to witness her whacked out eyes.
At the 1:35 mark of the second video, Hillary is introduced by a 'little person' who conveniently helps her down the stairs on to the set. Hop up to 4:12, 6:01, 6:10, and 6:21 to see her eyes scramble. It is particularly noticeable at 6:10.
