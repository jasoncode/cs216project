Sorry, Piers, but Joe Walsh just laid claim to the 'Musket' nickname with his post-election call to arms Posted at 5:26 pm on October 26, 2016 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter 
Some are interpreting radio host Joe Walsh's Wednesday afternoon tweet as a literal call to violence following the election, while it seems the majority are electing to point and laugh instead. At least gun control crusader Piers Morgan should be OK with it, seeing as Walsh's weapon of choice is a musket, just as the founders envisioned when they drew up the Bill of Rights.

Golly! Lou Dobbs blows the lid off the casserole dish, exposes Evan McMullin's Mormon Mafia ties Posted at 1:11 am on October 27, 2016 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter 
As Twitchy reported, presidential candidate Evan McMullin received some exciting news last week when a poll conducted by Emerson College showed him leading both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in Utah. 
Utah typically isn't a battleground state, but the Trump campaign dispatched Mike Pence there Wednesday to try to win back those voters who say they're voting for McMullin. How exactly did a third-party candidate manage to put the state in play? 
There's been plenty of chatter on the periphery of Twitter about the 'Mormon Mafia‚Äù driving McMullin's poll numbers in Utah, but it was a (now deleted) retweet by Fox Business Channel's Lou Dobbs that got people talking about how a Mormon mafia would go about shaking down citizens for their votes.

Another takeaway from our story is possible plan for future Trump TV network. Trump's spending campaign $ to build massive support list. 
‚Äî Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 9. He'll have 12-14 million emails, 2.5 million donors + because paid for with campaign funds, he'll own it ‚Äî a future audience for TrumpTV

‚Äî Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 
Trump TV is being compared to a U.S version of Britain's UKIP party: 11. If Trump loses, here's nightmare GOP scenario: he merges with Bannon to start a political-media movement, an American UKIP. Sound crazy? 
‚Äî Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 12. Breitbart's London editor, Raheem Kassam, just quit to run for leader of UKIP. His slogan: "Make UKIP Great Again." 
‚Äî Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) October 27, 2016 
According to the article, the idea for Trump TV started as a sort of threat to Roger Ailes because of what Trump thought was negative coverage, but it's morphed into something more realistic: 13. From the piece: "Trump TV" was Kushner's idea, posed as a threat to Roger Ailes during primaries when Trump was unhappy w/Fox coverage

The White House usually makes quite a big deal out of the president's commutation sprees, but the blog post accompanying Thursday's batch was relatively brief, noting that 'while there has been much attention paid to the number of commutations issued by the President, at the core, we must remember that there are personal stories behind these numbers.‚Äù Eggleston says the 98 commutations are going to individuals "who have diligently worked to rehabilitate themselves while incarcerated."

The people to whom some of these criminals sold drugs certainly have their own personal stories as well, but don't look for those in the news. Most of those granted clemency are serving time for nonviolent drug crimes, but while the president has teamed up with rapper Macklemore to fight opioid abuse, he's also cutting the sentences of a whole lot of crack and meth dealers. @markknoller Great, more criminals added to the thousands of others he's released into our communities. 
‚Äî Normi Shamblin (@RtisticOne) October 27, 2016 
Oh, yeah, and don't forget the guns. For a believer in gun control, the president doesn't seem to believe felons in illegal possession of firearms deserve the harsh sentences they were given. Of the 98 people granted clemency Thursday, 19 or so were felons in possession of firearms ‚Äî but sure, pass more gun control laws. Trending

In case the public missed the hint that, by questioning the integrity of America's electoral process, Trump was sowing the seeds of Election Day violence, a new wave of think pieces emerged to make the threat that much more explicit.

WHAAAA! The Left MELTS DOWN after FBI reopens Hillary 'email' case (poor Paul Krugman, ha!) Posted at 2:00 pm on October 28, 2016 by Sam J. 
As Twitchy reported earlier , the FBI has decided to reopen Hillary's email case because of recent developments, aka the WikiLeaks email dumps that Americans have been reading through on social media. 
Guessing the FBI felt stupid that they weren't the ones actually finding these things ‚Ä¶ maybe? 
And as can be expected, just like the big babies they are, the Left 'crapped‚Äù themselves immediately; take for example poor Paul Krugman: It's bad enough having the media do the "raises questions," substance-free innuendo thing. Worse when the FBI director does it. Disgraceful

From the New York Times : 
WASHINGTON ‚Äî A new trove of emails that appear pertinent to the now-closed investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server was discovered after the F.B.I. seized at least one electronic device shared by Anthony D. Weiner and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, federal law enforcement officials said Friday. 
The F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case ‚Äî one federal official said they numbered in the tens of thousands ‚Äî potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J.

If Hillary wants to know what new information the FBI has, Sharyl Attkisson knows someone she could ask Posted at 4:34 pm on October 29, 2016 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter 
As Twitchy reported, Hillary Clinton held a brief press conference Friday to address news that the FBI had found ‚Äî in the process of investigating Anthony Weiner's alleged sexting of a 15-year-old girl ‚Äî new emails that warranted further investigation into her own email scandal. 
Obviously not pleased by this latest development, Clinton called on the FBI to release whatever it had. Hillary Clinton: "We don't know the facts, which is why we're calling on the FBI to release all the information it has ‚Ä¶ let's get it out."

Don't worry about Hillary: BuzzFeed confirms she remained totally super awesome while under siege Posted at 5:54 pm on October 29, 2016 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter 
Well, this wasn't altogether unexpected. After news broke Friday that the FBI had uncovered new information pertinent to its investigation into Hillary Clinton, it wasn't long before reporters, as predicted, began filing stories about Republicans 'pouncing‚Äù on the news . 
That's all well and good ‚Äî everyone knew those mean Republicans would attack. As always, Clinton put up a brave front, challenging the FBI to go public with whatever it had, possibly including classified documents related to an ongoing federal investigation.

Clinton and her supporters certainly had reason to celebrate the conclusion of the case; that is, at least, until newly discovered evidence made it clear that the case wasn't concluded. 
Not surprisingly, Fallon was among those who decided Friday it wasn't so bad to second-guess the decision of a career prosecutor. Kellyanne Conway is on MSNBC now falsely saying Hillary Clinton is "under FBI investigation." This is what Jim Comey has wrought. 
‚Äî Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) October 29, 2016 
Are we back to that whole 'routine security review‚Äù talking point, or is Clinton not under investigation? Because the letter Comey sent to FBI employees Friday gave that impression pretty strongly: 
This morning I sent a letter to Congress in connection with the Secretary Clinton email investigation. Yesterday, the investigative team briefed me on their recommendation with respect to seeking access to emails that have recently been found in an unrelated case. Because those emails appear to be pertinent to our investigation, I agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review them. 
Of course, we don't ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed.

NO JUSTICE: Schools are banning creepy clown costumes, but Katy Perry's allowed to wear THIS? Posted at 8:14 pm on October 29, 2016 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter 
Earlier this month, the epidemic of creepy clowns became so widespread as to finally make it into a White House press briefing, where Josh Earnest suggested reporters maybe check with the FBI or Department of Homeland Security about how they were choosing to respond to the red-nosed menace. 
It doesn't take much of a Google search ‚Äî or maybe a search of your child's backpack for the note the teacher sent home ‚Äî to find that a lot of school districts, and even some municipalities, have banned clown costumes this Halloween. As if that and the fact that it falls on a Monday didn't suck all the fun out of Halloween this year, Katy Perry has ruined the holiday for everyone with her Hillary Clinton disguise. 
It reportedly took makeup artists six hours to apply the necessary prosthetics to simulate the aging effect of decades of scandals, and in the end, they ended up with ‚Ä¶ Jay Leno in a blonde wig?

Obviously Moore's not a Donald Trump fan, and like many other liberals this weekend, he's not an Anthony Weiner fan. Setting aside Judicial Watch's lawsuit against the State Department, Hillary Clinton almost looked to be in the clear a few months back, but now her email shenanigans have returned to the front pages, all because of Weiner's compulsion to send vulgar selfies online.

What did Bill Clinton do that was so wrong? Hillary long ago established that he was the victim of a vast right-wing conspiracy. And Weiner? Sure, be angry at him for the way he's treated his wife and the women he's sexted, but there would be no sensitive emails on his laptop if Hillary and company had simply used the secure government email accounts provided to them. 
Moore was just getting started on his misandrist rant, and when he's on a roll, it's best to step away until he's finished it. The day can't come soon enough when women will take charge. Public policy will not be decided by dick pix, Tic Tacs, grab-assers or the GOP.
