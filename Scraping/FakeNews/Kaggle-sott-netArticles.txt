 29 UTC The link between DNA and disease is by now obvious. But it's also obscure. A zillion moving parts go into disorders like cancer and Alzheimer's disease, and only a comparative few are known for sure. Researchers believe something called the Epigenome Roadmap a cascade of two dozen papers published last year is gradually changing that. The Roadmap is a catalog of the millions of epigenetic switches that control gene action. It's pretty clear that epigenetics is key to really understanding disease as well as normal human traits. Eventually, that is; nailing down those connections is going to take time. For one thing, disease mutations and other DNA variations, it turns out, are hardly ever where you would expect them to be: in genes that make the proteins that run the show. Ninety percent of disease-related mutations are in the regions of DNA that lie outside those genes, the regulatory regions that control protein-coding gene action. The working hypothesis is that variation in disease susceptibility - or any other trait - depends mostly on subtle differences in the expression of protein-coding genes, which is under epigenetic control. Mutations associated with Alzheimer's disease, in a surprising and immediately practical finding among those new papers, turned out to be active not so much in brain cells, where you might expect activity. Instead, they altered epigenomic activity in cells of the immune system. "Our results suggest that repression of neural pathways does not represent genetic predisposition, even though it is a hallmark of Alzheimer's," senior author Li-Huei Tsai of MIT said in a statement. "Instead, it may occur as a consequence of environmental factors and aging , and result from interactions with the altered immune pathways." This was work done in mice, so we don't know for sure that it applies to humans. But it gives scientists a hopeful new target for figuring out how to prevent and treat this devastating disease, which every day grows more urgent in our aging populations. Epigenome researchers also reported advances in asthma and allergy research. They identified more than two dozen genes that regulate IgE, the antibody that provokes allergic reactions. In some people, epigenetic mechanisms interfere with shutting down those genes at the right time. The result is the overproduction of IgE, which triggers asthma attacks. Miriam Moffatt, a senior investigator on the project, said in a statement, "The genes we identified represent new potential drug targets for allergic diseases as well as biomarkers that may predict which patients will respond to existing expensive therapies." What is the epigenome? But what is the epigenome anyway? The epigenome is the reason that all your body cells, which started out identical when your mother's fertilized egg began splitting into daughter cells, were able to turn themselves into specialists: brain, liver, heart, skin, etc. The epigenome is the reason identical twins, which have identical genomes, are always different from each other (sometimes very different), grow more different as they age, and often have different diseases. The epigenome is a reason that we humans are utterly unlike chimpanzees, even though our DNA differs very little. The simplest way to think about the epigenome is that it's all about the biochemical switches that turn genes on and off in particular cells at particular times of life. Epigenetics seeks to explain how the environment—what you eat, how your parents treated you, all of your life events and possibly even your ancestors' life events—has made you into you. Those biochemical switches are how nurture shapes nature. Explaining the relationship of the genome and the epigenome at a press conference announcing the papers (all published in Nature and associated journals), study coauthor Manolis Kellis of MIT said, "All our cells have a copy of the same book [the genome], but they're all reading different chapters , bookmarking different pages, and highlighting different paragraphs and words." The bookmarks Kellis spoke of are biochemical mechanisms that change the behavior of genetic material without changing any DNA sequences. The two best known and most studied of these mechanisms are DNA methylation and histone modification. Histones are the proteins DNA is wrapped tightly around. Histone modifications usually involve attachment of an acetyl group (CH3CO.) Acetylation helps tightly coiled DNA unwind a bit, making genes easier to get to and turn on. In methylation, methyl groups (CH3) stick to DNA and usually suppress gene expression. That's what was going on in the asthma study described above. Among asthma patients, the researchers found low methylation at 36 places in 34 genes. Low methylation meant the genes didn't get turned off. Hence overproduction of IgE antibodies that trigger asthma attacks. For the National Institutes of Health's Roadmap Epigenomics Program, hundreds of scientists around the world studied epigenetic events in more than 100 types of body tissues from healthy adults, fetal cells, and stem cells, assembling reference epigenomes for each one. These epigenetic patterns characteristic of each tissue can be compared to other samples, including tissue from people with dozens of diseases. Examples: type 1 diabetes, Crohn's disease, high blood pressure, inflammatory bowel disease and Alzheimer's disease. Comparisons permit scientists to see epigenetic abnormalities in particular cell types. Naysaying and cautions Not everybody thinks the epigenome project is awesome. An anonymous scientist blogging at Homolog.us - Bioinformatics complained, " Nothing managed to derail this expensive boondoggle over the last four years, including powerful critics of the scientific principle behind it, fraud allegation against the leader, public humiliation of its sister project ENCODE, NIH cost-cutting and protest of the scientists, and so on." As for the idea that diet, toxic exposures, parental behavior, and other lifestyle factors determine health, "not a single claim is backed by any science. We have gone through many of the relevant studies, and they were often based on poor-quality association studies of 30 or 40 persons and no further study of causal mechanism." That fulmination is a minority view, and it's not accurate to claim that all epigenetics studies are weak. But it is certainly the case that, despite the hoopla surrounding these papers, realizing gains to human health from research on the epigenome is a long way away. These studies need to be replicated and, in the case of studies done on animals, replicated in humans. But to date, epigenetics findings have been difficult to repeat . Also, epigenetic activity varies throughout the lifespan, and so epigenetic investigations tied to the aging process will be required. Studies of 1000 additional cell type epigenomes are being planned. Kellis, a leader of the Epigenome Roadmap Consortium roundly savaged at Homolog.us, certainly, can be counted a fan of epigenome research. But even his forecast, which is presumably optimistic, predicts that figuring out how one person's epigenome differs from another will take the next decade. Tabitha M.

 31 UTC © Yossi Cohen / Facebook Muslim family mistakenly prays in airport synagogue Jews in Israeli Ben Gurion International Airport were quite taken aback after they saw several Turkish Muslims praying in the airport's synagogue, apparently mistaking it for a mosque. The footage was released by Facebook user Yossi Cohen on Monday. "Today at the synagogue in Ben Gurion airport," he wrote under the video. They were all members of one Turkish family, according to Breaking Israeli news. They were apparently looking for a place to pray and found a synagogue which was empty. It was just before the holiday of Simchat Torah, a Jewish holiday that marks the end of the annual cycle of public Torah readings and the beginning of a new cycle. Religious Jews do not usually travel on such days. The family used the available Jewish prayer shawls, also known as tallits, as prayer mats. Tallits are shawls traditionally worn over the clothes by religious Jews during prayers. But when the Muslim family realized that they were praying in the synagogue, they "folded the shawls and explained that they'd just looked for a place to pray," a witness told NRG website. According to the Times of Israel , Ben Gurion Airport doesn't provide any facilities for believers of religions other than Judaism. Some Israelis welcomed the act of praying in the synagogue. According to Yehuda Glick, a member of the Knesset, he himself "prayed in a mosque" and he said he is "happy that Muslims prayed in a synagogue." "Where is the embarrassment? I couldn't find any," he wrote on Facebook, as cited by Arutz Sheva network. His position was supported by Rabbi David Menachem, rabbi of the Mishkan Yosef synagogue in Jerusalem. "A group of Muslims from Turkey innocently prayed in the airport synagogue in Ben-Gurion. Innocently and in honor of God," he wrote on Facebook. Comment: What a refreshing reaction. Facebook commenter David Auman added (automatic translation): Why is there really no place for Muslims to pray ben gurion airport? At the airport in turkey. They set a place for Jews to pray. (leave it were an issue in one small room with a partition in the middle, one half is for Christians and Jews and the other half... but at least they thought of us )

 39 UTC © Hikmet Durgun The Daesh terrorists' combat capabilities are nearly exhausted, and they are no longer capable of preventing Mosul from being liberated by Iraqi and Kurdish troops, Yazidi fighter Newsal Haci told Sputnik Turkey. In an interview with Sputnik Turkey, Yazidi soldier Newsal Haci, who serves with the Iraqi army, pointed to the inability of Daesh (ISIL/ISIS) to resist the liberation of Mosul, where he said the terrorists' combat capabilities' are already running out. He added that the Iraqi army is sweeping through territory formerly held by Daesh terrorists, and that the Iraqi forces currently need to cover just five kilometers to reach Mosul. © Sputnik/ Hikmet Durgun Yazidi fighter Newsai Heci "We are fighting for a democratic and secular Iraq, and we intend to liberate Mosul and the Yazidi people from Daesh terrorists at all costs," according to Haci. The Yazidis, an indigenous ethnic group with their own religion and customs, have been routinely oppressed and even enslaved under jihadist rule. "The jihadists' efforts are running out, and they already cannot conduct full-blow military activity, and are instead focusing on staging car bomb and trap mine explosions," he said. © Sputnik/ Hikmet Durgun A Yazidi fighter taking part in the Iraqi army's operation to liberate Mosul. Haci added that it is due to the fact that Daesh can no longer fight as they did before that the terrorists started to resort to such tactics. "We continue to move forward. To date, we have managed to kill more than 80 jihadists," he concluded. © Sputnik/ Hikmet Durgun Yazidi fighters taking part in the Iraqi army's operation to liberate Mosul. Meanwhile, Fezile Mustafa from the village of Terzilla near Mosul which was recently liberated from Daesh terrorists told Sputnik that she and her five children would only return to the village after the Iraqi army drives Daesh out of Mosul. © Sputnik/ Hikmet Durgun She said that "it is simply impossible" to return to Terzilla now that the village had been sacked and her home destroyed. "We will return only after Mosul is liberated. Perhaps more than anything else, we want two things, namely, the liberation of Mosul from Daesh and to return home," she added. © Sputnik/ HİKMET DURGUN Hezale Mustafa On October 17, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Abadi announced the start of a military operation to retake Mosul from Daesh. According to local media, about 30,000 Iraqi soldiers and 4,000 Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are taking part in the operation, which is backed by the airstrikes being carried out by the US-led international coalition. Earlier this week, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said that Turkish artillery and tanks are supporting Peshmerga's efforts to liberate Mosul, adding that if necessary Turkish air forces may assist in in the military operation. Comment: The US also seems optimistic retaking Mosul: US Central Command Expects More Resistance From Daesh Militants in Mosul US Central Command's Gen. Joseph Votel said that despite obstacles he is confident that Mosul would be retaken. The US Central Command's Gen. Joseph Votel warned Wednesday that, as an operation to liberate Mosul progress, the resistance of Islamic State (ISIL or Daesh) terrorists will increase. "I would expect we are going to run into more obstacles [and] more VBIEDs [vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices]. They've had a long time to prepare for that fight, so all of that we're going to contend with here very, very soon," Army Gen. Joseph Votel, commander of the Pentagon's unified command for the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia, told NBC. Army Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, commander of the US-led Combined Joint Task Force fighting Daesh, confirmed the information, adding that the Daesh deployed an "extraordinary" number of rockets and VBIEDs in Mosul. Nevertheless, he expressed confidence that Mosul would be retaken.

 00 UTC © USGS Map of the earthquake's epicenter An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.4 rattled a broad swath of central Italy, including Rome, on Wednesday (Thursday NZT), just two months after a powerful temblor toppled villages, killing nearly 300 people. There were no immediate reports of damage. Italy's National Vulcanology Center said the epicenter was near Macerata, near Perugia. The US Geological Survey said it had a depth of some 10 kilometres, which is relatively shallow. The quake was felt across a broad swath of central and southern Italy, shaking centuries-old palazzi in Rome's historic centre. The Aug. 24 quake destroyed hilltop village of Amatrice and other nearby towns. Wednesday's quake was felt from Perugia in Umbria to the capital Rome to the central Italy town of Aquila, which was struck by a deadly quake in 2009. The mayor of Aquila, however, said there was no immediate report of damage. ​The quake struck at 7.10pm on Wednesday (local time). "The earthquake only happened a few minutes ago. It's dark here, so impossible to determine if there has been any damage outside," one resident in Penna San Giovanni told EMSC. "All services - electricity, internet, etc - are still working normally." MORE TO COME

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 18:08 UTC © Peter Nicholls / Reuters Downing Street insists that the government will "make a success" of Brexit, despite a leaked audio recording of UK Prime Minister Theresa May predicting companies could abandon Britain if it leaves the EU. Speaking to a group of Goldman Sachs bankers on May 26 before the EU referendum, then-Home Secretary May said the economic arguments for remaining in the bloc were " clear. " In a leaked audio recording of the talk, published by the Guardian, May also claims membership in the EU makes Britain "more safe." "Being part of a 500-million trading bloc is significant for us. I think, as I was saying to you a little earlier, that one of the issues is that a lot of people will invest here in the UK because it is the UK in Europe. "If we were not in Europe, I think there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say, do they need to develop a mainland Europe presence rather than a UK presence? So I think there are definite benefits for us in economic terms." May went on to say Britain was more secure inside the EU. "There are definitely things we can do as members of the European Union that I think keep us more safe," she said. A Downing Street spokesman did not comment directly on the recording, but insisted Brexit is in the UK's best interests. "Britain made a clear choice to vote to leave the EU and this Government is determined to make a success of the fresh opportunities it presents," he said. "David Davis made very clear in the House of Commons last week the importance the Government places on financial services across the UK in the negotiation to come, as has the Chancellor in recent weeks. "We want a smooth and orderly exit from the European Union, which would be in the interests of both Britain and the EU." Labour politicians accused May of deceiving the British public over the impact of leaving the EU's single market and called on her to be "honest." Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer tweeted: Andrew Gwynne, shadow minister without portfolio, said: "As if we needed it, this recording is cast-iron evidence of how Theresa May and other senior Tories have been saying one thing in private about the economic impact of Brexit and another in the comfort of Tory conference halls. "It's plain that she recognises what a disaster it would be for Britain to lose access to the single market, so why doesn't she be honest with the British people and say how she plans to retain it?" Comment: Somebody apparently isn't happy about Brexit to have leaked this tape to stir up the pot.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 19:33 UTC © Eduard Korniyenko / Reuters Over 100 fighter jets, long-range bombers and combat helicopters have been scrambled at their bases across Russia and six post-Soviet states as the allies prepare to test their integrated air defense system in a massive military exercise. More than 130 command and control centers have been put on alert in Russia and six former Soviet republics - Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. All the countries contribute to the integrated air defense system overseen by the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) - an alliance of former Soviet republics that emerged after the collapse of the USSR. The large-scale military exercise is to train high-readiness forces in dealing with "airspace violations, including by hijacked aircraft" as well as "assisting crews of aircraft in distress," the ministry added. Some 100 aircraft, including Su-27, MiG-29 and MiG-31 fighter jets, Su-24 and Su-34 bombers, as well as Su-25 ground attack jets and combat helicopters provided by the allies, are expected to take part in the drill. Troops from electronic warfare and surface-to-air missile units are also participating. The exercise started at 8am Moscow time with Tu-160, Tu-95MS and Tu-22M3 aircraft given the roles of aggressor. The planes, simulating an adversary force, were spotted over Eastern European and Central Asian airspaces, the Russian military said. All units are being coordinated from a Russian Air Force command center located outside Moscow. The joint CIS air defense system, established in 1995, currently focuses on protecting the ex-Soviet countries' airspace as well as providing air or missile strike early warnings and coordinated responses. Russia contributes the bulk of the system's early warning and air defense capacities, with short- and long-range radar stations monitoring the area. Notably, the system does not have a single commander. It is collectively controlled by the chiefs of the air defense forces of the member states themselves. Bilateral air defense systems between Russia and its neighbors have also been established in recent years. Last December, an air defense agreement between Russia and Armenia was signed by the two countries' defense ministers, Sergey Shoigu and Seyran Oganyan, respectively. In 2013 Moscow signed a separate treaty on a joint regional air defense system with Kazakhstan. Russian and Belarusian anti-aircraft missile forces have already been unified into an integrated system designed to contain any security threats in the European theater. Comment: First footage of post-Soviet Joint Air Defense System drills can be seen here .

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 18:01 UTC Reports from Western Iraq said Israeli spies and reporters have used forged passports to enter the country after the start of the Mosul Liberation Operation. Israel is not recognized by Iraq, similar to many other Muslim states, and its citizens are not allowed into Iraq. But two major Israeli networks have sent their crews to the battlefield near Mosul and are releasing daily reports from the war. The Israeli coverage from Western Iraq caused concerns among the Arab, specially Iraqi media, and several reporters have approached the two teams to verify how they have entered the country. Hedas Haroush, an Al-Masdar reporter, said that "the Israelis have used forged European passports to get into Iraq. Ever since the war started numerous reports have surfaced the media claiming that Israeli and Saudi intelligence officers have been sighted among the ISIL terrorists, mostly to help the terrorist cult organize its structure and plan its war strategy. In the first such case, Iraqi army sources in Mosul testified that tens of Israeli officers were among the first group of foreign nationals that deployed in Mosul only a month after the city fell to ISIL in 2014.

Project Veritas Exposes DNC: Rigging the Election Pt. 3 - Killary Wanted "Ducks on the Ground" Project Veritas Action has released the fourth video in a multi-part series that is sending shockwaves through the DNC and the Clinton campaign. The first video explained the dark secrets and the hidden connections and organizations the Clinton campaign uses to incite violence at Trump rallies. The second video exposed a diabolical step-by-step voter fraud strategy discussed by top Democratic operatives and showed one key operative admitting that the Democrats have been rigging elections for fifty years. The third video exposed prohibited communications between Hillary Clinton's campaign, the DNC and the non-profit organization Americans United for Change. This latest video breaks down the process of the long-term investigation. In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer's effort . Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did. "First thing, like I said, thank you for the proposal. And I'd like to get the $20,000 across to you. The second call I'm going to make here is to my money guy and he's going to get in touch with you and auto wire the funds to you," said the PVA journalist. Creamer told the PVA journalist to send the money to Americans United for Change. Shortly after the money was released, the "donors" "niece" - another Project Veritas Action journalist - was offered an internship with Creamer. In an effort to see how far Creamer would go with the promise of more money, another Project Veritas journalist posing as the donor's money liaison requested a meeting with Creamer. During that meeting, Creamer spoke about connections he had with Obama and Clinton. After the release of the previous Project Veritas Action videos, Hillary Clinton and her staff tried to distance themselves from Robert Creamer. However, Creamer doubled down about connection with the campaign. "Every morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters," said Creamer. The more money that was promised to Creamer, the more access Project Veritas Action journalists seemed to get. Project Veritas Action's $20,000 investment paid off. The story was solid. Robert Creamer, Scott Foval, Jenna Price from the DNC, Brad Woodhouse from AUFC, Cesar Vargas and others opened the door to their smoke filled rooms of illegal and dirty campaign dealings, as seen in the three previous PVA videos. In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC's activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars. He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn't been a problem for the month that they had the money. After the former stories were released by Project Veritas Action, Americans United for Change fired Scott Foval and Robert Creamer announced to the DNC that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities. James O'Keefe and Project Veritas Action have filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission. Project Veritas Action Fund (AKA Project Veritas Action) was founded by James O'Keefe to investigate and expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud and other misconduct.

Sun, 23 Oct 2016 00:00 UTC Heather Ann Thompson's book " Blood in the Water : The Attica Prison Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy" is a detailed study of the inner workings of America. The blueprint for social control employed before and after the crushing of the Attica revolt is the same blueprint used today to keep tens of millions of poor people, especially poor people of color, caged or living in miniature police states. Thompson meticulously documents the innumerable ways the state oppresses the poor by discrediting their voices, turning the press into a megaphone for government propaganda and lies, stoking the negative stereotypes of black people, exalting white supremacy, ruining the lives of people who speak the truth, manipulating the courts and law enforcement, and pressuring state witnesses to lie to obstruct justice. Her book elucidates not only the past but also the present, which, she concedes, is worse. "America by the early twenty-first century had, in disturbing ways, come to resemble America in the late nineteenth century," Thompson writes near the end of her book. "In 1800 the three-fifths clause gave white voters political power from a black population that was itself barred from voting, and after 2000 prison gerrymandering was doing exactly the same thing in numerous states across the country. After 1865, African American desires for equality and civil rights in the South following the American Civil War led whites to criminalize African American communities in new ways and then sent record numbers of blacks to prison in that region. Similarly, a dramatic spike in black incarceration followed the civil rights movement—a movement that epitomized Attica. And just as businesses had profited from the increased number of Americans in penal facilities after 1870, so did they seek the labor of a growing captive prison population after 1970. In both centuries, white Americans had responded to black claims for freedom by beefing up, and making more punitive, the nation's criminal justice system." On Sept. 9, 1971, prisoners at the Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York rebelled in the face of intolerable conditions . They were sick of the racist-fueled violence of the white, rural guards; angry at poor medical care and the dearth of vocational and educational programs; underfed (the prison allocated only 63 cents a day to feed a prisoner); unhappy about their mail being censored, or destroyed if it was in Spanish; living in poorly ventilated cells with little or no heat or stifling heat; unable to buy basic commissary items on salaries that averaged 6 cents a day; and tired of being given only one bar of soap and one roll of toilet paper a month and allowed only one shower a week. The uprising was not premeditated. It took place when prisoners, trapped inadvertently by guards in a tunnel that led to the yard, thought they were going to be given another beating by sadistic correction officers. The spontaneous uprising took place "because ordinary men, poor men, disenfranchised men, and men of color had simply had enough of being treated as less than human, " Thompson writes. Four hundred fifty prisoners had previously staged a peaceful sit-down strike in the prison's metal shop to protest wages that, as a witness later testified at a New York state hearing, were "so low that working at Attica [was] tantamount to slavery." Prisoners had formed committees and sent respectful letters to prison authorities asking them to address their concerns. The requests were largely ignored. Despite authorities' promises that there would be no retribution, those who organized the protests were put in isolation or transferred to other prisons. The callousness of the officials was especially unconscionable in light of the fact that the state had netted huge sums for sales of products made by the prisoners. Comment: The slave labor system continues to this day, forcing inmates to begin hunger strikes and work stoppages to end prison slavery: End prison slavery!' 24,000+ inmates join nationwide jail strike causing lockdowns (VIDEO) After three days of negotiations, in which the prison authorities refused to grant the rebellious prisoners amnesty, 550 New York state troopers, 200 sheriff's deputies and numerous Attica prison guards were issued high-powered weapons, including rifles loaded with especially destructive bullets that expanded on impact, bullets banned in warfare under the Geneva Conventions. The prisoners had no firearms. The assault force members were fed a steady diet of lies and unfounded rumors to stoke their hatred of the prisoners. Black radicals were coming, they were falsely told, to the town of Attica to kidnap white children, a rumor that led to the closing of the schools. Through clouds of CS gas , the assault force stormed the yard, where some 1,200 prisoners held 42 guards and civilian staff members. It unleashed a blizzard of gunfire, shooting 130 people. Twenty-nine prisoners and nine hostages died. (One guard beaten by prisoners in the first moments of the uprising died later in a hospital.) The assault force, which had done all the killings that day, immediately began to hide evidence of its crimes. State officials told the press outside the prison that seven or eight of the hostages had died when the prisoners slit their throats. They claimed that the genitals of one of the guards were cut off and stuffed in his mouth. These reports were untrue, but they dominated the news coverage. Meanwhile, inside the retaken institution, many prisoners were suffering from gunshot wounds that would not be treated for days. Some were stripped and made to run gantlets in which they were beaten by guards with ax handles, baseball bats and rifle butts. Those singled out as the leaders of the rebellion were marked with Xs on their backs, forced to crawl through mud, tortured and in few cases, it appears, executed. New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and the Nixon White House feared that the rebellion presaged armed revolution. The scores of dead and wounded were, for them, a message to the rest of the country— defy us and we will kill you . Today, any citizen who seriously resists the corporate state can expect the same response. Comment: A perfect example: Private security mercenaries pepper spray and sic dogs on Dakota Access Pipeline protesters Thompson writes, "All of those assembled in the president's office agreed that while the morning's events made a particularly 'gruesome story,' news of the slashings and castration would go a long way toward discrediting America's 'bleeding hearts' like 'the Tom Wicker s of the world.' 'I think this is going to have a hell of a salutary effect on future prison riots,' Nixon said. 'Just as Kent State [the May 4, 1970, shooting by National Guardsmen of unarmed students that left four dead and nine wounded] had a hell of a salutary effect. ... They can talk all they want about force, but that is the purpose of force.' " The avalanche of government lies permeates the narrative —not a surprise to anyone who has reported on the inner workings of power or spent time in our prisons and marginal communities. There are heroes in the narrative. Their fate, which is almost universally bleak, is also instructive. The prisoner Sam Melville, who was serving an 18-year sentence in Attica for setting off explosives in government buildings to protest the Vietnam War, who taught classes to other inmates and who researched prison operations to show how the institution cruelly exploited prisoner labor for profit, was executed by guards after the uprising, according to other prisoners. So, apparently, was Elliot "L.D." Barkley, who was in prison for violating parole by driving without a license and who, although he was only 21, was one of the most articulate spokespeople for the prisoners. Prisoners such as Frank "Big Black" Smith, savagely tortured by guards after the uprising, and Bernard "Shango" Stroble rose up majestically during the revolt to protect hostages and maintain order, and they fought for justice long after their release from prison. Civil rights attorneys such as Ernie Goodman and William Kunstler came to the prisoners' defense. A few within the governmental system exhibited rare moral courage. Among them were Dr. John Edland of the Monroe County medical examiner's office, who refused to falsify autopsy reports and told the public that the hostages had been killed by state gunfire; Attica guard Michael Smith, who defied his own fraternity to speak the truth about state abuse; and government attorney Malcolm Bell, who exposed the state cover-up of the killings by the state troopers, sheriff's deputies and prison guards. However, most who knew the truth remained silent. Edland was especially singled out for condemnation. He was attacked as incompetent by state officials and called a clown and, although a Republican, a radical left-winger. (State troopers were dispatched to local funeral homes to prevent morticians from informing families of the cause of death of hostages.) Edland received death threats and other hate mail, was shunned by the local community and saw state troopers menacingly idle their automobiles in front of his home. Edland called the day he released the autopsy findings "the worst day of my life." When the state decides to isolate, discredit and crush you it has innumerable ways to do so. The press often is manipulated. Employers blacklist you. A gullible population is made to believe the caricature of you as a traitor or an enemy . Such smear campaigns are now directed against Julian Assange, Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden. New York State Police Capt. Henry "Hank" Williams oversaw the investigation into the 1971 assault. This meant that, in Thompson's words, "the main investigators of the crimes of Attica were those who may well have committed them." Williams made sure that "nothing related to the shooting—shell casings, the weapons themselves—was collected." No chalk outlines, usually required at a crime scene, were drawn to indicate where the bodies had fallen. No calculations were made regarding bullet trajectories. The yard where the killings took place was cleaned up under Williams' supervision as quickly as possible. Prisoners were threatened with violence or indictment if they refused to incriminate the leaders of the uprising. The goal was not justice; it was to punish and isolate the prisoner leadership and protect law enforcement. "When strong-arm tactics still proved ineffective," Thompson writes concerning one interrogation, "they switched their approach: should this witness help them, investigators suggested, they would, in turn, help him get paroled. In addition to enticing the witness with the possibility of parole, they also promised to make prison life easier for him in the meantime." Scores of prisoners were indicted in connection with the uprising; only one member of the assault force was charged, with a minor offense. The state's entire case when it went to the courts was built on a scaffolding of lies designed to exonerate the assault force and punish prisoner leaders. Jurors, who saw doctored films and photographs, never knew they were being presented with fabricated and tainted evidence, including photos of crude knives that had been planted next to slain prisoners. Witnesses recited stories fed to them by government investigators. The state has never admitted wrongdoing for the Attica assault, and important parts of the record —autopsies, ballistics reports, trooper statements, and depositions— remain sealed nearly five decades later . Thompson stumbled onto Attica files in the Erie County courthouse and the New York State Museum, but since her discovery, she writes, they have vanished or "been removed from anyone's view." "American voters ultimately did not respond to this prison uprising by demanding that states rein in police power, " she concludes. "Instead they demanded that police be given even more support and even more punitive laws to enforce. Comment: And despite the curent wave of police brutality, the sheeple continue to support them: Respect for police among Americans surges to highs not seen since late '60s "Indeed, the 1960s and 1970s were all about the politics of the ironic. At the Democratic National Convention protests of 1968, Kent State in 1970, and Wounded Knee in 1973, unfettered police power each time turned protests violent, and yet, after each of these events, the nation was sent the message that the people, not the police, were dangerous. Somehow, voters came to believe that democracy was worth curtailing and civil rights and liberties were worth suspending for the sake of 'order' and maintaining the status quo." Though immediately after the Attica uprising there were minor reforms, these improvements were soon rolled back. Conditions in prisons today are worse than those that led to the 1971 revolt. Control of prison populations is more brutal, more sophisticated and more inhumane. It is doubtful that the press, unlike at Attica in 1971, would ever be allowed inside a prison during an uprising to air the voices of the prisoners. Much of the worst damage was done during the Clinton administration . President Bill Clinton signed into law, with Republican support, the draconian 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. It provided $9.7 billion to build more prisons. By 1995 the prison population exceeded 1 million. It would soon double. "The fact that so many of these people now in prison had been arrested because they were drug addicts, mentally ill, poor, and racially profiled concerned few if any politicians , whether in a statehouse or in Washington, D.C.," Thompson writes. "Then, to make sure that this now enormous group of the incarcerated did not resist their deteriorating conditions of confinement via the nation's legal system as they had done so effectively both before and after the Attica uprising, in 1996 legislators passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA)." The PLRA made it difficult and often impossible for prisoners to use the courts to protect their Eighth Amendment right not to endure cruel and unusual punishment. The New York Times columnist Tom Wicker, who was part of the negotiating team that tried to resolve the Attica uprising without bloodshed, singled out white fear as the central issue in the 1971 case. "White fear fixed itself upon the literal presence of black human beings. Black people, to whites, were the symbolic representation of the evil in man and thus were also the handy instruments by which white people could hold themselves symbolically innocent of that evil." Wicker concluded, "The heart of the matter was the fear of blackness." This white fear remains unexamined in America. It allows us to stand by passively and watch the daily murders by police of unarmed black men and women. It allows us to maintain a prison system that holds a staggering 25 percent of the world's prisoners, the majority of them poor people of color. This white fear condemns us as a nation. It perpetuates the evil of white supremacy. Poor people of color have been robbed of the most elemental forms of justice and basic constitutional rights. But the state, in the age of deindustrialization, has no intention of stopping there. These forms of social control, so familiar to poor people of color, will bear upon all of us.

Mon, 24 Oct 2016 18:05 UTC Criminal defense attorney says both DNC and Clinton campaign guilty of 'numerous' crimes Undercover videos, released this week by conservative activist group Project Veritas, show Democratic operatives conspiring to incite violence at Trump rallies — and may be enough to warrant a federal investigation. Hillary Clinton has already faced one FBI investigation for her use of a private server to transmit and store emails while she was secretary of state, and now her campaign could face a second one into the Democrats' long tradition of violent agitation. "This is not just about inciting riots, which is bad enough, it is also about a confessed conspiracy to try to steal an election through violence." "There is sufficient factual predicate to open an investigation" into the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign's involvement in the conspiracies described in the videos, Brady Toensing, a white-collar criminal defense attorney, told LifeZette. " The potential crimes admitted to on the tapes are numerous," Toensing said. "There are civil rights violations and the crime of inciting a riot. But all you need is one, and then a conspiracy to commit any of these crimes is itself a federal felony, which on its own comes with up to five years in prison," he added. "There are also numerous potential state law violations and civil causes of action." © Project Veritas Scott Foval In one of the videos, Democratic consultant and Field Director for Americans United for Change Scott Foval admitted to paying people to incite violence at Trump events. "The bird-dogging. The aggressive bird-dogging. What I call it is 'conflict engagement,'" Foval said. "Conflict engagement in the lines at Trump rallies? We're starting anarchy. And he needs to understand that we're starting anarchy, " he continued. "We have mentally ill people that we pay to do sh**, make no mistake," Foval added. "If you're there and you're protesting and you do these actions, you will be attacked at Trump rallies. That's what we want." "Foval is describing what is called conduct laundering, but they got sloppy," said Toensing, a former U.S. Senate legislative aide for campaign financing who has represented clients in multiple state and federal campaign finance investigations. "In their arrogance, they bragged about the scheme on tape and, as part of that scheme, engaged a convicted felon, having him visit the White House more than three hundred times. It raises serious questions that call out for compelled answers given under oath," Toensing continued. © Project Veritas "Wherever Trumps and Pence are going to be, we have events and we have a whole team across the country that does both consultants and people from the Democratic Party. And the Democratic Party apparatus and the people from the campaign, the Clinton campaign and my role with the campaign is to manage all that." - Robert Creamer The felon to whom Toensing refers is Robert Creamer, a Democratic operative, DNC member, and head of the Democracy Partners organization, who spent five months in prison in 2006 on bank fraud and tax evasion charges. Creamer is the link between the campaign and Foval. "We are contracted directly to the DNC and the campaign," Foval said in the video. "I am contracted to [Creamer] but I answer to the head [of] special events for the DNC and the head of the special events and political for the campaign," he explained. Ultimately the campaign is responsible for his "rapid response" operations, Foval claimed. "The campaign pays DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays the Foval Group, the Foval Group goes and executes the sh** on the ground," he said. Another man caught on the video, Aaron Black, confirmed this relationship. Black identified himself as the "deputy rapid response director for the DNC for all things Trump on the ground," and claimed his role is secret. "Nobody's really supposed to know about me," Black said. Black also said it was this conspiracy that orchestrated the violence in Chicago. "So the Chicago protest, when they shut all that, that was us. It was more [Creamer] than me, but none of this is supposed to come back to us because we want it coming from people. We don't want it to come from the party." Creamer himself implicated Clinton directly in this nefarious scheme. "I mean, Hillary knows through the chain of command what's going on," he said. "The campaign is fully in it." © Project Veritas Aaron Black aka Aaron Minter This activity is a clear violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 2101, which forbids the use of "any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, including, but not limited to, the mail, telegraph, telephone, radio, or television with intent to incite a riot; or to organize promote, encourage, or carry on a riot; or to ... aid or abet any person in inciting or participating in or carrying on a riot or committing any act of violence in furtherance of a riot." "The shredding machines and BleachBit were probably put to work right after the release of these tapes. So time is of the essence," Toensing said. "The Republican Party should demand that state and federal authorities immediately open an investigation. They should demand that a grand jury be convened, that forthwith subpoenas be served, and that search warrants be executed," he suggested. There are other ways an investigation could be initiated, according to Toensing. "Congress can do its own investigation," said Toensing. "There's talk about that but they're out of session right now," he added. "Someone could [also] go to a local U.S. attorney where the offence occurred," Toensing continued. "If conduct spreads to a certain area, the local authorities have jurisdiction and the local district attorney can convene a jury," he said. "The FBI could [also] open an investigation on its own," Toensing noted. He also pointed out that the Secret Service has grounds to open an investigation into "people who are intentionally fomenting violence and creating a hazard for [a] candidate." In either case, however, "the U.S. attorney would then decide whether to proceed." Unfortunately, as Toensing observed, "the U.S. attorneys are appointed by Obama." The way Obama's Justice Department handled the Clinton email investigation — not to mention the implications for Obama if the DNC and Clinton campaign are prosecuted for a federal conspiracy — doesn't exactly breed confidence that the administration will take action. "I wouldn't hold my breath," Toensing said. Even if the Obama administration refuses to act, however, it is likely others involved will face consequences for their actions. "This is not just about inciting riots, which is bad enough," said Toensing. "It is also about a confessed conspiracy to try to steal an election through violence." The Left has been conspiring to bring about political change through violence since its very inception. Foval himself expresses this truth perfectly in the recording. Conservatives "have fewer guys willing to step out on the line for what they believe in," Foval said. "There is a level of adherence to rules on the other side."

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 18:19 UTC © Jen Psaki President Obama holds news conference at the White House. As an American, someone raised to believe truth and justice will prevail, I am appalled at the foreign and domestic policies of my country's government. The level and scope of the deceit with which the Obama administration has laid out onto the world stage is embarrassing. For the first time in my 61 years I realize why some figures in our history were ashamed of being known as American. Our leaders have shamed us, done irreparable damage to our heritage and our legacy as a people, and still most of my countrymen sit idle. America today reminds me of a traveling circus, three rings of evil clowns entertaining a peanut gallery of onlookers. Or are we participant clowns? For over the better part of Barack Obama's presidency we've witnessed the most respected nation transformed, step-by-step, into one of the most dreaded empires the world has ever known. 300 million people, all their ancestors, and their future generations will pay the overwhelming cost of Obama's mistakes and malfeasance in office. While I do not personally believe this man is evil, I am sure the people behind him are. The lies, the impact, the unbelievable devastation these people have unwrapped, it spells the end of a perfect dream for humanity. I wonder as I type this, how many people reading it will realize how true my words are. John Kirby, the spokesperson for the US Department of State is a prototype for all that is wrong with our nation. He is a mirror reflection of Secretary of State John Kerry, who is in turn a further reflection of Barack Obama and the people who stand behind. They lie, cheat, steal, kill, maim, or at best coerce in order to achieve goals their constituency (the people) have no inkling of. All of us knew politicians have always been liars and crooked, but the degree to which we can be betrayed is unheard of today. This press conference on the alleged bombing of Aleppo hospitals by Russia, it is damning, damnable evidence of what I am saying. This is, of course, if one watches intently and then reasons. Compare what Kirby says, with what you have seen or read from the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times. Measure the tone and content of this unique message. Bear with me, and I'll help you convict these warmongers of their crimes. The Circus of Liars I must point out that Barack Obama has had more State Department spokespersons than any president in history. First there was Sean McCormack, from 2005 to 2009, a leftover from the Bush administration. After McCormack's tour of administration liar in chief, he joined Boeing in 2009 and serves as the as vice president of Communications in Government Operations. McCormack left the Obama administration to more or less help Hillary Clinton and the "click" extend the growth of companies like Boeing. This Washington Post piece (amazingly) condemns both Hillary Clinton and McCormack for their apparent collusion to morph policy into business with, guess who? Why Mother Russia, of course. Philip J. "P.J." Crowley made his "deal with the devil" from 2009 to 2011. The 2011-2012 recipient of the General Omar N. Bradley Chair in Strategic Leadership (? The Military ties to State) is a War College bred and reared pentagon puppet. The fact most recent State Department liars are former military begs the question; "Why is our foreign policy institution lined with CIA, spooks, War College graduates and command grade military officers?" Crowley is an interesting example of how our foreign service is infested with war hawks and military industrial minions. To Crowley's credit, his candidness in the wake of the mistreatment of whistleblower Chelsea Manning, and his subsequent resignation redeemed this old soldier by comparison to his colleagues. He is emblematic of a system that uses good soldiers in order to mislead the people, and to misdirect our policies toward the wrong goals. Crowley is pretty much off the radar now, but somehow still semi-loyal to the Obama-Clinton team. His tweets on Twitter hum the Democratic Party line. He's now a Fellow at The George Washington University Institute for Public Diplomacy, which means he's been let out to pasture. Next we come to Victoria Jane Nuland, the pin-up girl of soulless and reprehensible US bureaucrats. From my perspective, as someone who has covered the Ukraine civil war extensively, Nuland in Kiev reminds me of the worst parts of the rise of Nazi Germany. I cannot possibly be bombastic enough in characterizing this Hillary Clinton spawn. It is not my nature to be unkind, or less than a gentleman, but this woman is no lady. Her hacked conversation, with fellow psychopath, US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, lives in infamy amidst volumes of horrid US intentions. "Fuck the EU", along with the clear regime change the Obama White House was behind, should have spelled resignation for this demonic Washington witch. She, and her colleague Pyatt, are complicit in the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children in the Donbass. Nuland, who most agree will be Hillary Clinton's Secretary of State should she reach office, is the most deadly psychopath the American people could possibly put in charge of our foreign service. For the Russians who still have to deal with her, I am sure 20 minutes looking at her is unbearable. This is America fiddling, while our reputation abroad burns. She is the queen of regime change, she and her husband children of the ideology America needs to forcefully alter world governments. This is the "WOW" persona, the caricature of disastrous Washington policy. Don't take my word, research Nuland starting here , and see where it leads. Jen Psaki lied so well, and stuck up her nose to the dissenting press so expertly, she graduated the US State Department right up to the White House. Those of us who winced at her nonchalant misrepresentation of facts, also understand she is part of the click that now inhabits the halls of power in Washington. Psaki is part of a country club that runs it all. If the Democrats win in November's presidential election, people like Psaki will become monsters, an empowered American politburo kin to the worst fascists in history. Psaki is the official cheerleader now, of a White House campaign to create a legacy for the worst president in American history. Catch her Twitter feed her, and figure out why in the world Barack Obama would want to be a Wired Magazine editor for a day. Despite her pallid and docile appearance, make no mistake, this Obama minion is as deadly as Nuland, maybe even more so. I recall Psaki launched a social media attack on Russia that was nearly universally ridiculed as "hash tag diplimacy." Her "hot mic" comment on her own points on Egypt at a press conference as being "ridiculous", they remind me of Obama being caught promising then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev he'd "fix" the ABM missiles issue if he won in 2012. What makes this spokesperson so dangerous is her forward enthusiasm, and her seeming happy-go-lucky satisfaction with being part of the biggest lie ever perpetrated. Lying is transfigured into truth, a job well worth doing. Good God. Finally we come to John Kirby, Naval War College trained mouthpiece for Emperor Caligula (look him up and compare to our presidents) and whichever Nero we elect next. A Public Affairs Officer (PAO) at the command level in the US Navy, he's what many former military people would refer to as a first class boot licker. I'm a squid myself, so I am familiar with the type. Kirby would climb a tree to tell a lie, if ordered to do so, and show righteousness in doing so. Kirby, Kerry, the whole Obama administration is utterly absurd. This recent press conference reveals just how out of bounds US policy is. Furthermore, Kirby's contention the Syrian war cannot end without airpower being grounded is likewise idiotic. The State Department's stance on Russia's hammering of jihadists only makes sense, if the overthrow of Assad and his legitimate government is a goal. John Kirby: Syrian War Won't End Without Grounding Aircraft - this is the headline that calls our attention to the fact Assad is about to wreck Washington's plan. Regime change has become such a common term now, that media consumers are immune to what it really means. Since the first Bush took office, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, more governments have been turned upside down than at any time since World War II. And the "Kirbys" of the world are accomplices to massive world chaos. Kirby's "Russians in body bags" threat has pushed the Kremlin's panic button now. We have descended into crisis policy, an all or nothing lunacy that can only end in war. Three Rings of Evil Clowns These people are all deplorable. But compared to the linchpins of war they speak for, each is insignificant by comparison. This message for instance, the New York Times headline "U.S. Officials Say Russia Probably Attacked U.N. Humanitarian Convoy", it did not originate with them. Our new "probably" dogma is a function of a failing freedom, the complete takeover of a free press by western oligarchs that make Russian mafia types seem impotent. Watching this evil circus reminds me of a twisted horror movie, a guttural glimpse at wicked clowns betraying the children they are supposed to love and entertain. The Soros and Rockefeller types, those Rotschilds and the Goldman Sachs sharks, Silicon Valley fakers and Wall Street urchins the Clintons take money off of, the whole mess in our nation's capital stinks to high heavens. Just how my countrymen stomach it leaves me breathless and clueless at times. America is taking part in a wider broadcast of the movie The Turman Show these days. Raised up to believe in freedom of the press and the merits of democracy, my countrymen have been conditioned to rely on their media, their leaders, and the seeming implausibility that one group can take over the world. Well, a group has taken over half of it, and with the proper time and funding, this can be proven. Since me or some other researcher has no such investigative grant, the case against these evil clowns goes untried. The Nation, Slate, Global Research, RT, and myriad independent media attempt to dissent. But trillions of dollars flow back and forth fueling the paranoiac message - Russia is the enemy again! The first ring of circus clowns wield more power than Xerxes, the Bilderbergs probably even believe their own cause - perpetuating the elite order is, after all, a noble genetic cause. In the second ring business types and the oh-so aggressive and ambitious, they will literally do anything to succeed. The Clintons, Bushs, and Obamas out there are the master puppets. Their mission is pretty clear, pay the devil his due and cash in. It's really as simple as all that. Today's Washington is a bit like Chicago during Capone's time. Once the "Man" has you, he's got you but good. La Cosa Nostra hasn't got anything on the numbers games along the Potomac. The little crime bosses, grown up from their internships and grant designations, they pepper every institution in America. As they graduate, God knows what goals the Kirbys of the world set out to achieve. In the wider center ring, it's easy to see the Clinton Foundation workers really do drink Bill and Hillary's Kool Aid. Mind washed into believing in the ultimate bullshit, naïve middle intellectuals become squirming opportunists, oblivious to the fact they sold out. The "Man" has got them, and early on. Meanwhile, the whole mess is cloaked in the guise of democracy, and hidden underneath people's fear they'll be called conspiracy theorists. George Orwell's 1984 seems to have been written to exclude the possibility complete control could be achieved. But isn't that how complete control is ultimately achieved? Above the center ring, high up on the flying trapeze liberty defies death. The people are doing a high wire act without a net. We are the third ring of clowns, only we are hesitant to see our role as sellouts too. America is life under the big top, with our favorite pop stars handing out peanuts. I don't know how you feel about it, but I feel utterly betrayed.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 18:08 UTC © Peter Nicholls / Reuters Downing Street insists that the government will "make a success" of Brexit, despite a leaked audio recording of UK Prime Minister Theresa May predicting companies could abandon Britain if it leaves the EU. Speaking to a group of Goldman Sachs bankers on May 26 before the EU referendum, then-Home Secretary May said the economic arguments for remaining in the bloc were " clear. " In a leaked audio recording of the talk, published by the Guardian, May also claims membership in the EU makes Britain "more safe." "Being part of a 500-million trading bloc is significant for us. I think, as I was saying to you a little earlier, that one of the issues is that a lot of people will invest here in the UK because it is the UK in Europe. "If we were not in Europe, I think there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say, do they need to develop a mainland Europe presence rather than a UK presence? So I think there are definite benefits for us in economic terms." May went on to say Britain was more secure inside the EU. "There are definitely things we can do as members of the European Union that I think keep us more safe," she said. A Downing Street spokesman did not comment directly on the recording, but insisted Brexit is in the UK's best interests. "Britain made a clear choice to vote to leave the EU and this Government is determined to make a success of the fresh opportunities it presents," he said. "David Davis made very clear in the House of Commons last week the importance the Government places on financial services across the UK in the negotiation to come, as has the Chancellor in recent weeks. "We want a smooth and orderly exit from the European Union, which would be in the interests of both Britain and the EU." Labour politicians accused May of deceiving the British public over the impact of leaving the EU's single market and called on her to be "honest." Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer tweeted: Andrew Gwynne, shadow minister without portfolio, said: "As if we needed it, this recording is cast-iron evidence of how Theresa May and other senior Tories have been saying one thing in private about the economic impact of Brexit and another in the comfort of Tory conference halls. "It's plain that she recognises what a disaster it would be for Britain to lose access to the single market, so why doesn't she be honest with the British people and say how she plans to retain it?" Comment: When it comes to leaks in the UK, where the press is very tightly controlled, it's a sure bet that the govt wanted the public to hear this. The 'long goodbye' continues.

Tue, 25 Oct 2016 00:00 UTC © NASA Saturn's polar hexagon changes color from 2012 to 2016. It's like nothing we've seen on any other planet in the entire Universe, and now the mysterious structure on Saturn's north pole just got even weirder. In just four years, Saturn's hexagon has changed its colour from blue to gold. So far, our best guess as to why this change occurred is that this is what it looks like when Saturn's north pole gears up for next year's summer solstice. Discovered almost 30 years ago, Saturn's hexagon is a six-sided structure that spans roughly 32,000 km (20,000 miles) in diameter, and extends about 100 km (60 miles) down into the planet's dense atmosphere. As observed by NASA's Voyager and Cassini spacecraft, each point of the hexagon appears to rotate at its centre at nearly the same rate that Saturn rotates on its axis. Along the rim of the hexagon, a jet stream of air is blasting eastward at speeds of 321 km/h (200 mph). © NASA Based on its size and movements, scientists have concluded that it's a vast cloud pattern generated by a gigantic, perpetual hurricane spinning at the centre of the planet's north pole. Scientists estimate that this storm has been raging for decades - maybe even centuries . While we're pretty confident that we know what Saturn's hexagon is, the big mystery is how it got there in the first place. Once you have a giant whirlpool of air, it's relatively easy to keep it spinning - but the force you need to get it wound up in the first place is a whole lot more difficult to explain. "Scientists have bandied about a number of explanations for the hexagon's origin," says Charles Q. Choi from Space.com. "For instance, water swirling inside a bucket can generate whirlpools possessing holes with geometric shapes. However, there is of course no giant bucket on Saturn holding this gargantuan hexagon." Now we've got something else to explain - how the Cassini spacecraft could have observed two completely different colours in the hexagon between November 2012 and September 2016. Here's more of the false colour hexagon: The best hypothesis we have right now is that this is what it looks like when Saturn changes seasons. With a year that lasts 29 Earth years, Saturn changes seasons only once every seven years, and the increased sunlight over the past three years could explain the golden haze. As NASA explains: "The colour change is thought to be an effect of Saturn's seasons. In particular, the change from a bluish colour to a more golden hue may be due to the increased production of photochemical hazes in the atmosphere as the north pole approaches summer solstice in May 2017." So how does this work? It's thought that the hexagon acts sort of like a barrier, preventing haze - or aerosol - particles produced on the outside from getting in. This is evidenced by the fact that when scientists analysed the hexagon in false colour (as seen in the video), they noticed differences in the types of particles that were being suspended in the atmosphere - both inside and outside the hexagon. "Inside the hexagon, there are fewer large haze particles and a concentration of small haze particles, while outside the hexagon, the opposite is true," Kunio Sayanagi, a Cassini imaging team associate at Hampton University, explained back in 2013. "The hexagonal jet stream is acting like a barrier, which results in something like Earth's Antarctic ozone hole." During the polar winter between November 1995 and August 2009, Saturn's north polar atmosphere became clear of aerosols produced by photochemical reactions - reactions caused by sunlight interacting with the atmosphere - and we got to see its hexagon in clear blue: © NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute/Val Klavans True color photo taken 26 June 2013 But since Saturn reached its equinox in August 2009 - the point where the Sun is directly over Saturn's equator - it's been gradually exposed to more and more sunlight. This means for the past three years, aerosols have been produced inside of the hexagon and around the north pole, making the polar atmosphere appear hazy and golden when photographed last month. Without more evidence though, this is just an educated guess , and scientists at NASA now have an investigation underway to figure out what's actually going on here. "Other effects, including changes in atmospheric circulation, could also be playing a role," NASA explained this week . "Scientists think seasonally shifting patterns of solar heating probably influence the winds in the polar regions." Cassini is continuing its orbits around Saturn, and its moons, Titan, Mimas, Daphnis, Methone, and Pandora, in the coming months , so get ready to see more strange images of their seasonal shifts.

Mon, 24 Oct 2016 21:12 UTC © www,syrian-cyber-army.net Several Belgian media outlets announced that they had fallen victim to a cyberattack. A Syrian hacker group claimed responsibility, saying the attack was retaliation for the Belgian air force bombing a village near Aleppo. A number of Belgian media websites, including De Standaard, RTBF, Het Nieuwsblad, Gazet van Antwerpen and Het Belang van Limburg, reported they have been subjected to a coordinated DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack on Monday afternoon, which temporarily shut down their sites. The attack was claimed by a group calling itself the Syrian Cyber Army, as punishment for the media helping to cover up their government's actions in Aleppo . "We attacked the Belgian media that hide the work of its air force in Syria," a statement on their website reads . "We call on the international community to support us in shaming the Belgian authorities, who orders the killing of dozens of civilians in the town of Hassadjek near Aleppo on October 18, and caused damage to civilian infrastructure," the Syrian hackers wrote. "Instead of strikes on Daesh [Islamic State], the international coalition led by the United States targets only civilians and deceives the international community about its goals in Syria." The attack comes in the wake of information from the Russian Defense Ministry that two Belgian F-16 jets flying from Jordan struck Hassadjek in Aleppo province on October 18, killing six civilians. The Belgian government has strongly denied involvement in the bombing, and has demanded that Russia take back the accusations. The Het Nieuwsblad has alleged that Russia supports and finances the hacking group. The hacking attack itself appears to have been carried out from Turkey. However, the federal prosecutor's office has yet to start an investigation. Over the course of the civil war, Syrian hacking groups have claimed attacks on various news organizations they believe paint the Assad government in a negative light. Among these is the Syrian Electronic Army, formed in 2011, which has targeted the BBC, al-Jazeera and National Public Radio, among other outlets. Their tactics range from DDoS attacks - in which thousands of computers will overwhelm a server by requesting access all at once - to spamming, malware, phishing and defacing websites. Some of the attacks have been humorous at times. After hacking the BBC Weather's Twitter, a headline read "Saudi weather station down due to head on-collision with camel." Comment: Belgium is falling right in line with the US: Proof doesn't matter; 'blame Russia' for everything.

Tue, 25 Oct 2016 00:00 UTC © Guido Amrein Switzerland/Shutterstock Melanesian children of Papua New Guinea Hints of an unidentified, extinct human species have been found in the DNA of modern Melanesians - those living in a region of the South Pacific, northeast of Australia. According to new genetic modelling, the species is unlikely to be Neanderthal or Denisovan - two ancient species that are represented in the fossil record - but could represent a third, unknown human relative that has so far eluded archaeologists. "We're missing a population, or we're misunderstanding something about the relationships," Ryan Bohlender, a statistical geneticist from the University of Texas, told Tina Hesman Saey at Science News. Bohlender and his team have been investigating the percentages of extinct hominid DNA that modern humans still carry today, and say they've found discrepancies in previous analyses that suggest our mingling with Neanderthals and Denisovans isn't the whole story. It's thought that between 100,000 and 60,000 years ago, our early ancestors migrated out of Africa, and first made contact with other hominid species living on the Eurasian landmass. This contact left a mark on our species that can still be found today, with Europeans and Asians carrying distinct genetic variants of Neanderthal DNA in their own genomes. And that's not all they've given us. Earlier this year, researchers investigated certain genetic variants that people of European descent inherited from Neanderthals , and found that they're associated with several health problems, including a slightly increased risk of depression, heart attack, and a number of skin disorders. And a separate study published earlier this month found evidence that modern genital warts - otherwise known as the human papillomavirus (HPV) - were sexually transmitted to Homo sapiens after our ancestors slept with Neanderthals and Denisovans once they left Africa. While our relationship with Neanderthals has been widely researched, how we interacted with the Denisovans - the distant cousins of Neanderthals - is less clear. The problem is that Neanderthals are well represented in the fossil record, with many remains having been uncovered across Europe and Asia, but all we have of the Denisovans is a lone finger bone and a couple of teeth that were found in a Siberian cave in 2008 . Using a new computer model to figure out the amount of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA carried by modern humans, Bohlender and his colleague found that Europeans and Chinese people carry a similar amount of Neanderthal DNA: about 2.8 percent. That result is pretty similar to previous studies have estimated that Europeans and Asians carry, on average, between 1.5 and 4 percent Neanderthal DNA. But when they got to Denisovan DNA, things were a bit more complicated, particularly when it came to modern populations living in Melanesia - a region of the South Pacific that includes Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, West Papua, and the Maluku Islands. As Hesman Saey explains for Science News: "Europeans have no hint of Denisovan ancestry, and people in China have a tiny amount - 0.1 percent, according to Bohlender's calculations. But 2.74 percent of the DNA in people in Papua New Guinea comes from Neanderthals. And Bohlender estimates the amount of Denisovan DNA in Melanesians is about 1.11 percent, not the 3 to 6 percent estimated by other researchers. While investigating the Denisovan discrepancy, Bohlender and colleagues came to the conclusion that a third group of hominids may have bred with the ancestors of Melanesians." "Human history is a lot more complicated than we thought it was," he told her. This find is supported by a separate study by researchers from the Natural History Museum of Denmark, who analysed DNA from 83 Aboriginal Australians and 25 locals from the Papua New Guinea highlands. As we reported last month, this was the most comprehensive genetic study of Indigenous Australians to date, and it indicated that they are the oldest continuous civilisation on Earth, dating back more than 50,000 years ago. But the results revealed something else - DNA that was very similar to that of the Denisovans, but distinct enough for the researchers to suggest that it could have come from a third, unidentified hominid . "Who this group is we don't know," lead researcher Eske Willerslev told Hesman Saey. Until we have more concrete evidence of this hypothesised third human species (some fossils would be nice), we can't prove this , and we should point out that Bohlender's estimates have yet to be formally peer-reviewed , so they might shift with further scrutiny. And it could be that our identification of Denisovan DNA is more ambiguous than we think, given that our only source is a finger bone and a couple of teeth. But the evidence is mounting that our interactions with ancient humans were far more complex than we'd assumed, which shouldn't be much of a surprise, when you think about it. Just because we don't see them in the fossil record doesn't mean they didn't exist - preserving the remains of something for tens of thousands of years isn't easy, and then someone has to be in the right place at the right time to dig them up. Hopefully, the more we investigate the genetic make-up of our most ancient societies, the more hints we'll get of the rich and complicated history our species shared with those that didn't make it to modern times. The results of Bohlender's analysis were presented last week at the 2016 American Society of Human Genetics meeting in Canada.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 19:25 UTC © Waterford Whispers News In a bid to clear up any confusion about their latest ruling on the cremated remains of loved ones, the Vatican confirmed it is still alright to scatter paedophile priests wherever they want, but not ashes. Yesterday the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church urged followers not to scatter the ashes of the dead after cremation and instead to store them in places approved by the Church. "We'll make all the decisions on who and what goes where, thank you very much," German cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Muller, the prefect of the doctrinal watchdog, told WWN, "Scattering the remains of loved ones on unholy ground will only ruin their chances of staying in heaven. But the scattering of paedophile priests is fine, though; when we're doing it," before adding, "Please leave all the important decisions on the welfare of others to us. We won't let any of our worshipers down". The latest move comes just 53 years after the Vatican 'legalised' cremation, mirroring the amount of time it takes for the church to act on various different subjects, including child sex abuse. "We don't make decisions lightly here, so we like to take our time," the Cardinal admitted, "But when we do, we like to make sure that they are the best decisions tailored for the financial gain of our multi-billion euro a year organisation". A two-page instruction issuing new rules on cremation also said that there were even some cases where a Christian funeral could be denied to those who request that ashes be scattered. "There is absolutely no profit for us if someone gets cremated and spread over some field for free," Muller pointed out, breathing on a 24 carrot ring on his hand before polishing it on his silk gown, "We offer an array of allotments across the world, and at a bargain price too. We'll even throw in an annual mass and a few prayers graveside for any cremated relative wishing to be buried on sacred ground". Allotments can range anywhere between €5,000 to €19,000 for a family plot, with the church charging over €20,000 for extra holy burial slots.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 18:02 UTC © nsnbc international Serena Shim, American journalist October 19 marks two years since the very sudden and suspicious death of American journalist Serena Shim near Suruç, Turkey, close to the Syrian border. Although all signs point to foul play, indeed murder, by Turkish intelligence, until now the US government has neither conducted nor demanded an inquiry into the events of the alleged car accident which Turkish officials say was the cause of Shim's death, let alone offer condolences to the family. Serena Shim was at the time reporting on Ayn al-Arab (Kobani), from the Turkish side. She was, in her own words, one of the first, if not the first, on the ground to report on ,"Takfiri militants going in through the Turkish border". These include not only ISIS but also terrorists from the so-called Free Syrian Army (FSA). As Shim's sister Fatmeh Shim stated in 2015 , "She caught them bringing in ISIS high-ranked members into Syria from Turkey into camps, which are supposed to be Syrian refugee camps." Serena Shim's January 2013 expose , Turkey's Pivotal Role in Syria's Insurgency: PressTV Report from Inside Turkey, showed footage of what she estimated to be 300 semi-trucks "awaiting militants to empty them out"; included testimony explaining how Turkey enables the crossing of foreign terrorists "freely" into Syria; spoke of the funneling of arms via the Incirlik US Air Base in Turkey to terrorists in refugee camps or on through to Syria; and highlighted the issue of terrorist training camps portrayed as refugee camps, guarded by the Turkish military. Shim named the World Food Organization as one of the NGOs whose trucks were being used to funnel terrorists' arms into Syria, and stated this in her last interview, just one day before being killed. Notably, in that interview she also explicitly stated that she feared for her life because Turkish intelligence had accused her of being a spy. She told Press TV: "Turkey has been labeled by Reporters Without Borders as the largest prison for journalists, so I am a bit frightened about what they might use against me... I'm hoping that nothing is going to happen, that it's going to blow over. I would assume that they are going to take me in for questioning, and the next hope is that my lawyer is good enough to get me out as soon as possible." Two days later, Press TV announced her death , stating: "Serena was killed in a reported car accident when she was returning from a report scene in the city of Suruch in Turkey's Urfa province. She was going back to her hotel in Urfa when their car collided with a heavy vehicle." This was the official version of her death, although in subsequent versions the story changed. In a report one month later, Russia Today (RT) spoke with Shim's sister, who said: "There's so many different stories. The first was that Serena's car was hit by a heavy vehicle, who proceeded to keep on driving. They could not find the vehicle nor could they find the driver. Two days later, surprisingly, they had found the vehicle and the driver, and had pictures of the heavy vehicle hitting my sister's car. Every day coming out with new pictures of different degrees of damages that have happened to the car." "Serena and my cousin who was the driver of the car were taken to two different hospitals. She was reported first dead at the scene. Then coming out with later reports that she passed away at the hospital 30 minutes later from heart failure?! " POLITICAL BLACKOUT, MEDIA BLACKOUT When on November 20, 2014, at a Daily Press Briefing, RT journalist Gayane Chichakyan twice pressed Director of Press Office, Jeff Rathke, for updates on Shim's death, he unsurprisingly gave none: Chichakyan: "It's about the journalist Serena Shim, who died in Turkey under very suspicious circumstances. Did her death raise suspicions here at the State Department?" Rathke: "Well, I think we've spoken to this in the briefing room several weeks ago, after it happened. I don't have anything to add to what the spokesperson said at the time, though." Chichakyan: "But then she died several days after she claimed she had been threatened by the Turkish intelligence. Have you inquired about this? Have you asked questions? Is there really nothing new about this?" Rathke: "Well, I just don't have any update to share with you. Again, this was raised shortly after her death. The spokesperson addressed it. I don't have an update to share with you at this time." Chichakyan: "I just want to go back to Serena Shim. You rightly said the State Department commented on her death several weeks ago, and you say there is no update. Why is there no update? A U.S. citizen dies days after she said she'd been threatened by the Turkish intelligence." Rathke: "Well, I simply don't have any information to share at this time. I'm happy to check and see if there's anything additional. We spoke out about it, as I said, at the very start several weeks ago after her death, so I - but I don't have anything with me right now to offer. I'm happy to check and see if there's more that we can share." Of course, neither he nor any US government official has followed up . Last year, Shim's mother, Judy Poe, replied to me in a message: "There is no doubt in my mind that my daughter did not die in a car accident. There was not one single scratch on her there was no blood absolutely anywhere. I have tried to contact the American Embassy in Turkey with the cell phone numbers they gave me originally when I was going to get my daughter. Absolutely no response from the American Embassy in Turkey, including via personal cell phones." Shim's sister in her RT interview stated, "We've got no support whatsoever, nor have we got condolences." None of the major journalist organizations have pursued a just investigation into Shim's murder, much less lamented it. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) turns up zero results when Shim's name is searched on their website . Yet, the CPJ does have a list of journalists killed in Turkey since 1992, and as recent as Feb 2016, obviously minus Shim's name. Likewise, a search on the Reporters Without Borders website turns up zero results . A December 19, 2014 article at the Greanville Post does have a CPJ spokesperson stating: "The Committee to Protect Journalists has investigated the events surrounding Serena Shim's death in Turkey and at this time has found no evidence to indicate that her death was anything other than a tragic accident. Unless her death is confirmed to be in direct relation to her work as a journalist, it will not appear on our database. In the event that new evidence comes to light, CPJ would review her case." The article Greanville Post notes, "As of February 2016, the CPJ has not changed its position." The International Federation of Journalists does have a short entry on Shim: "Serena Shim, the female correspondent for Press TV in Turkey was killed in a car accident on the Turkish-Syrian border. She was returning from an assignment in Suruç, a rural district of Şanlıurfa Province of Turkey when her car collided with a truck." But no call for inquiry and no questioning of official narrative. In a November 21, 2014 article at Shim's death, RT noted that, "the office of the Representative on Freedom of the Media at the OSCE told RT that Turkey is carrying out an investigation." It cited OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, Gunnar Vrang, as saying: "The representative has been following the case since the first reports appeared about the car accident that claimed the life of journalist Serena Shim. According to information available to her office, the Turkish authorities have started investigation into the details of the car accident." Searching the OSCE for Serena Shim's name also results in zero hits. On February 5, 2016, Judy Poe tweeted: Clearly the representative went with the Turkish rendition of events. Few in corporate media have looked into Shim's suspicious death. In one surprising exception, Fox News reported on Shim's death, citing a US State Department spokesperson as saying the State Department "does not conduct investigations into deaths overseas." Given that Turkish intelligence threatened Shim, according to her testimony, and that Turkey is notorious world-wide for its imprisonment and murder of journalists, the US State Department's lack of concern is incriminating in itself. In stark contrast to the silence around Shim's death, John Kerry at least twice publicly mourned the death of James Foley, lauding as a hero the journalist who snuck into Syria via Turkey to report embedded with al-Qaeda and other terrorists, and giving sincere condolences to his family. Without a trace of irony, in August 2014, Kerry said of Foley , and never of Shim, "We honor the courage and pray for the safety of all those who risk their lives to discover the truth where it is needed most." In September, 2014, Kerry directly contradicted the above-mentioned words of the State Department spokesperson, saying: "When terrorists anywhere around the world have murdered our citizens, the United States held them accountable, no matter how long it took. And those who have murdered James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria should know that the United States will hold them accountable too, no matter how long it takes." On the media and political blackout around Serena Shim's suspicious death, Shim's former colleague, Afshin Rattansi, host of RT's Going Underground posited: "There were a few press reports, but nothing like the kind of reporting about a brave young journalist that one would expect. Was this because the story she was covering was so dangerous that a NATO ally like Turkey should be cooperating with ISIS... was that the reason that this story has not been more widely broadcast? We don't know." Indeed, this would not be the first time the US administration has not pursued justice for the murder of one of its citizens by an ally. Rachie Corrie's March 16, 2013 murder by an Israeli soldier driving a bulldozer was not only witnessed by numerous rights activists with Corrie in Rafah, occupied Palestine, but was filmed. There is no denial that the Israeli soldier saw Corrie, drove his dozer over her and then reversed back, crushing her twice. Yet, in spite of the efforts of her family and supporters, the US has never pursued justice for this American citizen either. Judy Poe said that Serena's favourite motto was: "I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees." Shim lived the motto. She was 29, with two children, when killed. Eva Bartlett is an independent writer and rights activist with extensive experience in Syria and in the Gaza Strip, where she lived a cumulative three years (from late 2008 to early 2013). She documented the 2008/9 and 2012 Israeli war crimes and attacks on Gaza while riding in ambulances and reporting from hospitals. From June-August 2016, she visited Syria for her fifth time. Her writings can be found on her blog, In Gaza (www.ingaza.wordpress.com) Comment: It seems evident Shim was too close to revealing the true situation and the players involved. It is a tragedy that the price was her life.

Mon, 24 Oct 2016 00:00 UTC © Fitzgerald Griffin Foundation/Russia Insider President Obama, Vladislav Krasnov, Ph.D An Open Letter to Barack Obama Dear Mr. President: As your presidential duties will soon expire, I want you make sure your Nobel Peace Prize is deserved: Please instruct your officials to return to the path of negotiations with Russia , be it the Syrian crisis, the lapse of the plutonium nuclear arms control deal or Ukraine. By so doing, you will bequeath to your successor —whomever it might be— a solid foundation on which to build a healthier and more peaceful Planet Earth. The United States should re-commit to the policy of non-interference in domestic affairs abroad that our Founding Fathers consistently proclaimed and adhered to. Instead of imposing our cherished values of "free-market" and "democracy" abroad, let us rely on the wisdom of a man who risked the reputation of a "traitor" when he defied King George's war on American colonies. I am talking about Edmund Burke, the British philosopher and father of modern conservatism. Like ancient Greeks he argued that each country is entitled to its own form of government, be it democracy, republic, monarchy, tyranny or despotism, each of which tend to evolve into its opposite. Therefore, the colonies do not have to bow to the King. Burke's monument now graces Washington DC. In respect to Russia, remember that Empress Catherine the Great refused King George's request to send Russian Cossacks help him quell George Washington's rebellion. During the Civil War, while Europe's powers-- Great Britain, France, and Spain—tried to take advantage of President Lincoln's problems with the South, Tsar Alexander II who had just abolished serfdom in Russia, sent Russian Navy to the harbors of New York and San Francisco as a gesture of Good Will. More recently, in spite of the USSR's unconcealed hostility to "Capitalist" America, the two countries were able to co-operate in the defeat of Nazi Germany and Japan, and then keep the bitterness of Cold War in check. After 1991, the Communist Russia is no more. The New Russia has been espousing the same values of private property, free enterprise, multi-party free elections, secular government, and freedom of speech and religion— as we do. To be sure, the post-1991 Russian road has been rocky, but this because we meddled on the side of the Russian oligarchs and because it takes years and decades to cultivate free enterprise and democracy in a country that had none for 73 years. In late 1980s, when I was writing Russia Beyond Communism: A Chronicle of National Rebirth (Westview Press, 1991), Soviet soldiers were forbidden to wear crucifix. Now General Sergei Shoigu, Russia's Minister of Defense, would not enter the Red Square without crossing himself publicly. President Vladimir Putin is regularly seen in a church in front of an icon and has addressed Russian Muslims in a mosque and Jews in a synagogue. It's a truly tectonic shift in global affairs since the end of the Cold War in 1991. Therefore, I say, Mr. President, take a breath of fresh air and do what it takes to make your Nobel Peace Prize count: Leave the legacy of peace-seeking negotiations with Russia from which your successor will not deviate lest he or she be called an abominable war monger. More than any other two countries, Russia and the United States are called upon safeguard Peace, Freedom and Commerce not just from San Francisco to Vladivostok, but on the entire Planet Earth. So help us God! Sincerely, W George Krasnow, Ph.D. (aka Vladislav Krasnov) President, RAGA.org October 10, 2016 W. George Krasnow (also published as Vladislav Krasnov), Ph.D., runs the Russia and America Goodwill Association, a non-profit organization of Americans for friendship with Russia.

Tue, 25 Oct 2016 19:19 UTC © google Militants entrenched in the eastern part of Aleppo have carried out another artillery attack, injuring at least four civilians in the western part of the city, RT's Murad Gazdiev reports. Militant groups once again targeted West Aleppo's Hamdaniya district, as they continued to shell residential areas controlled by the government forces. Tuesday's attack came just a day after three people were killed, including a child, and 28 more injured in another attack on Hamdaniya and Salahuddin neighborhoods. The latest shelling occurred about 10am local time (07:00 GMT), reported Murad Gazdiev, RT's correspondent at the scene. He also visited Aleppo University hospital, where the victims of the most recent militant attack were being treated. Militants and terrorists that took up positions in eastern Aleppo have been constantly and indiscriminately shelling the western part of the city. On October 18, at least three people were killed and dozens injured when the Jamiliya neighborhood was shelled. The attacks come as Russia and Syrian government forces initiated a humanitarian pause by halting their air strikes a week ago. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the city did not witness any Russian or Syria air strikes for a week. Officers from the Russian reconciliation center and Syrian authorities also helped 48 women and children to leave the rebel-held area on Monday and provided them with necessary aid. Meanwhile, militants repeatedly sabotaged the ceasefire efforts by shelling humanitarian corridors and killing civilians. Moscow has been assisting Damascus in its battle against Al-Nusra terrorists, who have turned eastern Aleppo into a militant stronghold. Comment: See also:

Tue, 25 Oct 2016 00:28 UTC With the future of US healthcare likely to rest on the next presidency, a new study from Psychology, Health & Medicine highlights just how complex the medical needs of many Americans now are. As the authors of the study, Elizabeth Lee Reisinger Walker and Benjamin G. Druss, observe: "The health of individuals in the U.S.A. is increasingly being defined by complexity and multimorbidity , the co-occurrence of two or more chronic medical conditions." Given the medical and socio-economic difficulties often faced by people with mental illness, and the lack of research into the other medical conditions they might suffer from, the authors set out to discover, using publicly available data, what proportion of US adults experience each combination of mental illness, substance abuse/dependence and chronic mental conditions. They also investigated how those combinations of conditions were related to poverty. They found that overall, 18.4% of adults had a mental illness in the past year, and 8.6% reported substance abuse/dependence during the same time. Nearly 40% had one or more chronic medical conditions in their lifetimes, and 14.7% were living in poverty. Compared to individuals without any condition, adults with one condition (any mental illness [AMI], substance abuse/dependence or chronic conditions) reported higher percentages of living in poverty, receiving government assistance, having less than a high-school education, being unemployed, and having no health insurance. When looked at together, 6.4% of individuals reported AMI and chronic conditions, 2.2% reported AMI and substance abuse/dependence, 1.5% reported substance abuse/dependence and chronic medical conditions, and 1.2% -- equivalent to 2.2 million people -- reported all three conditions. The association between mental illness and substance abuse is also laid bare by the study: people with AMI were over three times more likely to report substance abuse/dependence, almost 1.5 times more likely to have a chronic medical condition, and 1.2 times more likely to live in poverty. As Elizabeth Lee Reisinger Walker commented on the research last week: "Just over half of adults in the US have one or more chronic condition, mental disorder, or dependence on substances. These conditions commonly overlap with each other and with poverty, which contributes to poor health." The pair conclude that improving the health of people with multimorbidities will involve increased access to and coordination between a variety of services. As they observe: "Collaborative care models are effective in treating mental illnesses in primary care and providing primary care in specialty mental health settings." Walker concludes: "In order to promote overall health, it is important to consider all of a person's health conditions along with poverty and other social factors." But what the future holds for the 50% of Americans suffering from multiple health challenges remains to be seen. Journal Reference: Elizabeth Reisinger Walker, Benjamin G. Druss.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 19:45 UTC © The Canary Leaked documents reveal that the Treasury now faces a £16bn financial black hole in our finances. But despite this, the government has promised to reimburse our super-rich Queen £1m for the money she'll lose out on when leaving the EU. The leaked documents A series of leaked documents , posted on the government's website in error , has revealed that the Treasury faces a black hole of up to £16bn this year. Due to a combination of poor economic decisions and increased levels of borrowing, this means that the UK's deficit is well behind the 27% forecasted reduction rate. With the uncertainty of the global financial market, this black hole is only likely to increase. As The Canary previously reported , many global banks are again stockpiling gold. This is to secure their assets and ensure their currency can be backed up in case of an emergency. During Gordon Brown's reign, however, the UK sold off the majority of its gold, meaning the UK's currency isn't supported by any assets. If a global financial crash were to come, this would prove devastating. The Queen Despite these dire circumstances, the government has promised to secure the Queen's wealth and reimburse her for any losses which may occur after Brexit. The Queen, like many other aristocrats, benefits from the EU's Common Agricultural Policy . Initially created in 1962 to help protect farmers against unstable crop prices, it has instead been helping the most wealthy and privileged. Every year, the UK's richest landowners receive payouts, with the Queen bagging over £1m a year . Sandringham Estate receives close to £700,000 a year, while Windsor Castle receives £300,000. Prince Charles also benefits from the EU's policy and gets £100,000 a year just for his estates. Since the announcement of the Brexit vote, the Conservative government has pledged [ paywall ] to pick up the subsidy bill at least until 2020. Sir Gerald Howarth, a former Conservative defence minister who backed Brexit, said : What we all said during the Leave campaign was that all those currently in receipt of so-called EU money will continue to receive the same money because we will be saving £20bn every year. We must reassure the recipients - whether it's Her Majesty or farmers - that they will continue to benefit from the current arrangements. The Queen and the Treasury While money made from the Crown's estates feeds back into the Treasury, the Queen and her family still benefit from a large profit. These estates, known as the "Sovereign's public estate", are technically neither government property nor part of the monarch's private estate. But the government still pays the Queen. On top of the Brexit reimbursement, the monarch is set to receive £42.8m from the Treasury between 2016-2017. This figure is £12m more than that in 2012 and means an extra £2.7m will be taken from the taxpayers' pocket. So while the Treasury faces a black hole six times the size of the NHS deficit , the government is continuing to spend the taxpayers' money to provide for a super-wealthy aristocrat. While many people may still support the Queen, it cannot be denied that the monarchy is losing its appeal. In a recent review , it was discovered that Chester Zoo, Stonehenge, and the Roman Baths are more successful tourist attractions than Windsor Castle. Alongside this, more and more republicans are calling for a referendum on abolishing the monarchy after the Queen dies. If the government continues to prioritise her over the needs of the British public, support for this cause may well increase.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 19:54 UTC © AFP 2016/ BULENT KILIC Commenting on the recent reports that Russia has started exchanging intelligence data with the Turkish Army to ensure the effectiveness of Ankara's Euphrates Shield operation in Syria , retired Turkish Air Force Lt. Gen. Erdogan Karakus told Sputnik that the move signals major changes in Turkish foreign policy. Russia has already started sharing its intelligence data with the Turkish army, which will ensure the effectiveness of Ankara's Euphrates Shield operation in Syria, Russia's Izvestia newspaper reported on Monday. According to the newspaper, the agreement was reached during recent negotiations between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan. First Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Defense and Security at the Federation Council (upper house of parliament) Franz Klintsevich told the newspaper that Turkey quietly joined the intelligence sharing pool created by Russia, Syria, Iraq and Iran . "We pass Turkey data on our radio intercepts, electronic intelligence and imagery intelligence that may be of interest to it," the senator said. "In response, they also share information. Turkey has very effective intelligence agencies and very good agents in Syria ," he added. Commenting on the move, Retired Air Lieutenant General Erdogan Karakus, General President of TESUD (Turkey Retired Officers Association) told Sputnik Turkiye that the pace of development of Russian-Turkish relations amid the mounting tension in Turkish-American relations signifies major changes to Turkish foreign policy. Ankara is demonstrating its readiness to upgrade its cooperation with Moscow to an unprecedented level , creating prerequisites for further strategic partnerships, including in the military-political sphere. "Turkey pays high importance to the Open Skies Treaty. Signed in 1992, it is aimed mainly at strengthening trust between the signatories," Erdogan Karakus told Sputnik. "Unfortunately this February Turkey denied Russia an observation flight over its territory. However the situation has drastically changed since then and Russian inspectors now perform observation flights over Turkey . This is one of the major indications of a new stage in development of Russian-Turkish relations," he added. "The exchange of intelligence data, negotiations on the creation of a Turkish anti-missile defense system with the deployment of Russia's S-300 and S-400 systems, the opening of its territory for observation flights signifies the growing trust in relations between the two countries," Karakus said. Retired Air Lieutenant General noted that such a development is only more natural as the American 'Greater Middle East' project equally worries both Russia and Turkey. To be able to prevent all the threats arising from this project the cooperation between the two countries should be ultimately upgraded to a strategic level. There are no hurdles for the further strategic partnership between the two, Karakus finally stated. Comment: This should pretty much put to rest any speculation that Ankara at risk of coming to the aid of the terrorists in eastern Aleppo. Russia would not develop such close ties with them if there was a risk Turkey would basically go to war against the Syrian army, and thus the Russians as well. In all likelihood, Erdogan is acting within certain clearly defined limits in northern Syria.

Sky & Telescope Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:05 UTC Astronomers have mapped atomic neutral hydrogen across the entire sky, creating an unprecedented portrait of our galaxy and some of its nearest neighbors. © HI4PI Collaboration This map depicts the radiation from neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) across the entire sky, as seen by the Parkes and Effelsberg radio telescopes. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, appears as a luminous band across the sky with the Galactic Center in the middle. The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are prominently visible in orange below the Galactic plane. They are surrounded by huge clouds of gas, forcefully disrupted from their hosts by gravitational interaction with the Milky Way. The HI emissions of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and its neighbor, Triangulum (M33), are also easy to spot as bright purple ellipses in the lower left. The gas motion is color-coded to represent the gas's motion, and the visual brightness in the image relates to how much neutral hydrogen is present. Hydrogen is the single most abundant element in the universe. The simple pairing of a proton and electron is so reactive that atomic hydrogen doesn't occur naturally on Earth — it reacts with itself or other elements to form molecules instead. But in the large, mostly empty space between stars floats a copious amount of neutral atomic hydrogen. We only know it's there when the atom's lone electron very occasionally flips from an "up" state to a "down" state, releasing a single 21-centimeter radio wave. Modern radio telescopes can easily pick up the faint signal, which multiplies thanks to the wealth of hydrogen atoms. What's hard is to map that signal across the entire sky — and that's exactly what astronomers have done in unprecedented detail. Using two of the world's largest fully steerable radio dishes, the 100-meter Effelsberg dish near Bonn, Germany, and the 64-meter Parkes dish west of Sydney, Australia, astronomers have generated a survey they've dubbed HI4PI. Pronounced "hi four pie," the survey refers to the abbreviation for neutral hydrogen (HI) and the geometrical reference to the whole sky (4PI, or 4&pi;). Over thousands of hours on the sky, the dishes took more than a million individual observations. Thousands more hours went into processing dozens of terabytes of data, removing radio interference from broadcast stations, military radar, and other Earthbound sources, then stitching everything together into a seamless map of the hydrogen sky. The resulting image is incredible: the ultrafine detail reveals fine threads and diffuse clouds in the interstellar medium never seen before. And for astronomers studying faraway X-ray or gamma-ray sources, the map will prove essential in cleaning the window to the distant universe. The map shows not only the amount of hydrogen at each celestial location, but also the motion of hydrogen across the sky: the 21-centimeter radio signal shifts to slightly lower or higher energies as the hydrogen gas moves toward or away from us, respectively. Watch the video below to take a stepwise look through the data, seeing first the most negative velocities (infalling gas, moving toward Earth) and ending with the most positive radial velocities (receding gas from Earth's perspective).

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 18:19 UTC © Jen Psaki President Obama holds news conference at the White House. As an American, someone raised to believe truth and justice will prevail, I am appalled at the foreign and domestic policies of my country's government. The level and scope of the deceit with which the Obama administration has laid out onto the world stage is embarrassing. For the first time in my 61 years I realize why some figures in our history were ashamed of being known as American. Our leaders have shamed us, done irreparable damage to our heritage and our legacy as a people, and still most of my countrymen sit idle. America today reminds me of a traveling circus, three rings of evil clowns entertaining a peanut gallery of onlookers. Or are we participant clowns? For over the better part of Barack Obama's presidency we've witnessed the most respected nation transformed, step-by-step, into one of the most dreaded empires the world has ever known. 300 million people, all their ancestors, and their future generations will pay the overwhelming cost of Obama's mistakes and malfeasance in office. While I do not personally believe this man is evil, I am sure the people behind him are. The lies, the impact, the unbelievable devastation these people have unwrapped, it spells the end of a perfect dream for humanity. I wonder as I type this, how many people reading it will realize how true my words are. John Kirby, the spokesperson for the US Department of State is a prototype for all that is wrong with our nation. He is a mirror reflection of Secretary of State John Kerry, who is in turn a further reflection of Barack Obama and the people who stand behind. They lie, cheat, steal, kill, maim, or at best coerce in order to achieve goals their constituency (the people) have no inkling of. All of us knew politicians have always been liars and crooked, but the degree to which we can be betrayed is unheard of today. This press conference on the alleged bombing of Aleppo hospitals by Russia, it is damning, damnable evidence of what I am saying. This is, of course, if one watches intently and then reasons. Compare what Kirby says, with what you have seen or read from the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times. Measure the tone and content of this unique message. Bear with me, and I'll help you convict these warmongers of their crimes. The Circus of Liars I must point out that Barack Obama has had more State Department spokespersons than any president in history. First there was Sean McCormack, from 2005 to 2009, a leftover from the Bush administration. After McCormack's tour of administration liar in chief, he joined Boeing in 2009 and serves as the as vice president of Communications in Government Operations. McCormack left the Obama administration to more or less help Hillary Clinton and the "clique" extend the growth of companies like Boeing. This Washington Post piece (amazingly) condemns both Hillary Clinton and McCormack for their apparent collusion to morph policy into business with, guess who? Why Mother Russia, of course. Philip J. "P.J." Crowley made his "deal with the devil" from 2009 to 2011. The 2011-2012 recipient of the General Omar N. Bradley Chair in Strategic Leadership (? The Military ties to State) is a War College bred and reared Pentagon puppet. The fact most recent State Department liars are former military begs the question; "Why is our foreign policy institution lined with CIA, spooks, War College graduates and command grade military officers?" Crowley is an interesting example of how our foreign service is infested with war hawks and military industrial minions. To Crowley's credit, his candidness in the wake of the mistreatment of whistleblower Chelsea Manning, and his subsequent resignation redeemed this old soldier by comparison to his colleagues. He is emblematic of a system that uses good soldiers in order to mislead the people, and to misdirect our policies toward the wrong goals. Crowley is pretty much off the radar now, but somehow still semi-loyal to the Obama-Clinton team. His tweets on Twitter hum the Democratic Party line. He's now a Fellow at The George Washington University Institute for Public Diplomacy, which means he's been let out to pasture. Next we come to Victoria Jane Nuland, the pin-up girl of soulless and reprehensible US bureaucrats. From my perspective, as someone who has covered the Ukraine civil war extensively, Nuland in Kiev reminds me of the worst parts of the rise of Nazi Germany. I cannot possibly be bombastic enough in characterizing this Hillary Clinton spawn. It is not my nature to be unkind, or less than a gentleman, but this woman is no lady. Her hacked conversation, with fellow psychopath, US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, lives in infamy amidst volumes of horrid US intentions. "Fuck the EU", along with the clear regime change the Obama White House was behind, should have spelled resignation for this demonic Washington witch. She, and her colleague Pyatt, are complicit in the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children in the Donbass. Nuland, who most agree will be Hillary Clinton's Secretary of State should she reach office, is the most deadly psychopath the American people could possibly put in charge of our foreign service. For the Russians who still have to deal with her, I am sure 20 minutes looking at her is unbearable. This is America fiddling, while our reputation abroad burns. She is the queen of regime change, she and her husband children of the ideology America needs to forcefully alter world governments. This is the "WOW" persona, the caricature of disastrous Washington policy. Don't take my word, research Nuland starting here , and see where it leads. Jen Psaki lied so well, and stuck up her nose to the dissenting press so expertly, she graduated the US State Department right up to the White House. Those of us who winced at her nonchalant misrepresentation of facts, also understand she is part of the clique that now inhabits the halls of power in Washington. Psaki is part of a country club that runs it all. If the Democrats win in November's presidential election, people like Psaki will become monsters, an empowered American politburo kin to the worst fascists in history. Psaki is the official cheerleader now, of a White House campaign to create a legacy for the worst president in American history. Catch her Twitter feed, and figure out why in the world Barack Obama would want to be a Wired Magazine editor for a day. Despite her pallid and docile appearance, make no mistake, this Obama minion is as deadly as Nuland, maybe even more so. I recall Psaki launched a social media attack on Russia that was nearly universally ridiculed as "hash tag diplomacy." Her "hot mic" comment on her own points on Egypt at a press conference as being "ridiculous", they remind me of Obama being caught promising then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev he'd "fix" the ABM missiles issue if he won in 2012. What makes this spokesperson so dangerous is her forward enthusiasm, and her seeming happy-go-lucky satisfaction with being part of the biggest lie ever perpetrated. Lying is transfigured into truth, a job well worth doing. Good God. Finally we come to John Kirby, Naval War College trained mouthpiece for Emperor Caligula (look him up and compare to our presidents) and whichever Nero we elect next. A Public Affairs Officer (PAO) at the command level in the US Navy, he's what many former military people would refer to as a first class boot licker. I'm a squid myself, so I am familiar with the type. Kirby would climb a tree to tell a lie, if ordered to do so, and show righteousness in doing so. Kirby, Kerry, the whole Obama administration is utterly absurd. This recent press conference reveals just how out of bounds US policy is. Furthermore, Kirby's contention the Syrian war cannot end without airpower being grounded is likewise idiotic. The State Department's stance on Russia's hammering of jihadists only makes sense, if the overthrow of Assad and his legitimate government is a goal. John Kirby: Syrian War Won't End Without Grounding Aircraft - this is the headline that calls our attention to the fact Assad is about to wreck Washington's plan. Regime change has become such a common term now, that media consumers are immune to what it really means. Since the first Bush took office, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, more governments have been turned upside down than at any time since World War II. And the "Kirbys" of the world are accomplices to massive world chaos. Kirby's "Russians in body bags" threat has pushed the Kremlin's panic button now. We have descended into crisis policy, an all or nothing lunacy that can only end in war. Three Rings of Evil Clowns These people are all deplorable. But compared to the linchpins of war they speak for, each is insignificant by comparison. This message for instance, the New York Times headline "U.S. Officials Say Russia Probably Attacked U.N. Humanitarian Convoy", it did not originate with them. Our new "probably" dogma is a function of a failing freedom, the complete takeover of a free press by western oligarchs that make Russian mafia types seem impotent. Watching this evil circus reminds me of a twisted horror movie, a guttural glimpse at wicked clowns betraying the children they are supposed to love and entertain. The Soros and Rockefeller types, those Rothschilds and the Goldman Sachs sharks, Silicon Valley fakers and Wall Street urchins the Clintons take money off of, the whole mess in our nation's capital stinks to high heavens. Just how my countrymen stomach it leaves me breathless and clueless at times. America is taking part in a wider broadcast of the movie The Truman Show these days. Raised up to believe in freedom of the press and the merits of democracy, my countrymen have been conditioned to rely on their media, their leaders, and the seeming implausibility that one group can take over the world. Well, a group has taken over half of it, and with the proper time and funding, this can be proven. Since I or some other researcher has no such investigative grant, the case against these evil clowns goes untried. The Nation , Slate, Global Research, RT, and myriad independent media attempt to dissent. But trillions of dollars flow back and forth fueling the paranoiac message - Russia is the enemy again! The first ring of circus clowns wield more power than Xerxes, the Bilderbergs probably even believe their own cause - perpetuating the elite order is, after all, a noble genetic cause. In the second ring business types and the oh-so aggressive and ambitious, they will literally do anything to succeed. The Clintons, Bushs, and Obamas out there are the master puppets. Their mission is pretty clear, pay the devil his due and cash in. It's really as simple as all that. Today's Washington is a bit like Chicago during Capone's time. Once the "Man" has you, he's got you but good. La Cosa Nostra hasn't got anything on the numbers games along the Potomac. The little crime bosses, grown up from their internships and grant designations, they pepper every institution in America. As they graduate, God knows what goals the Kirbys of the world set out to achieve. In the wider center ring, it's easy to see the Clinton Foundation workers really do drink Bill and Hillary's Kool Aid. Mind washed into believing in the ultimate bullshit, naïve middle intellectuals become squirming opportunists, oblivious to the fact they sold out. The "Man" has got them, and early on. Meanwhile, the whole mess is cloaked in the guise of democracy, and hidden underneath people's fear they'll be called conspiracy theorists. George Orwell's 1984 seems to have been written to exclude the possibility complete control could be achieved. But isn't that how complete control is ultimately achieved? Above the center ring, high up on the flying trapeze, liberty defies death. The people are doing a high wire act without a net. We are the third ring of clowns, only we are hesitant to see our role as sellouts too. America is life under the big top, with our favorite pop stars handing out peanuts. I don't know how you feel about it, but I feel utterly betrayed.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:10 UTC © Peter / Sputnik Soviet soldiers crossing a river. The North-Western Front. Kiev is trying to re-write history to create the impression that Ukraine was uniformly a victim of a Russian-controlled USSR. This is simply not true. The old shared state wasn't always dominated by Russians and Ukrainians played major roles. In case you missed it, last week, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's Parliament, approved a document which states how the USSR was responsible for the outbreak of World War II. Yes, that Soviet Union, the same one which was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1941, during Operation Barbarossa, and lost anywhere between 25 and 40 million people as a result of the conflict, depending on who you believe. That the Rada these days exhibits more theatricality than its famous London drama school namesake is a given. But do MPs seriously expect people to swallow the notion of how the USSR, which incidentally was allied with Britain, France and the USA against the Germans, bears responsibility for the war's commencement? It seems they do. And they are trying to rope in the Polish and Lithuanians to legitimize their factual modification enterprise. Indeed, given the characters running the show in Vilnius and Warsaw these days, it's not inconceivable that they might succeed in their mission. Although in the latter's case it would be weird to facilitate the heirs of a mindset shared by the perpetrators of the Volyn and Galician massacre where up to 100,000 Poles were butchered by Ukrainian radicals in 1943. Incidentally, Ukraine has just censored a new Polish movie about the carnage. It's no secret how Kiev is crawling with foreign PR advisers these days, and much of the country's rebranding efforts since Maidan have displayed a level of sophistication heretofore unseen in the ex-Communist world. But this latest wheeze is incredible in its deviousness. The justification for the archival editing is the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939, which divided Poland between Germany and the USSR. Now, that treaty was immoral and make no mistake about it. But it came after France and Britain had destroyed any chance for an anti-fascist front with the Munich Agreement, which allowed Hitler to march into Czechoslovakia. And many scholars contend that Moscow signed it in order to buy time before the inevitable Hitler invasion. It's worth mentioning how Ukrainians played a big part in the governance of the Soviet Union back then. And highlighting the fact that Poland itself also seized a part of Czechoslovakia in 1938 when it annexed the Teschen District! Which somewhat undermines its victimhood. False Correlation Despite Kiev's current attempts to paint the Soviet Union as a Russian-only affair, the historical reality is rather different. For instance, the original "People's Commissars" (equivalent to a ministerial cabinet) who created the state were a multi-national mix, featuring a Georgian by the name of Josef Stalin and three Ukrainians. Leon Trotsky, who essentially 'co-founded' the USSR with Vladimir Lenin, hailed from Kherson and Anatoly Lunacharsky was a native of Poltava. Meanwhile, Pavel Dybenko was born in Russia's border city of Bryansk to a Ukrainian family. Later, after Stalin replaced Lenin, the Georgian's Grigory Ordzhonikidze and Lavrentiy Beria came into the Kremlin's elite circle, in addition to Armenia's Anastas Mikoyan. And during the war, two men with deep associations to Ukraine began to rise up the ranks. The first was Nikita Khrushchev, who moved to Donbass as a teenager and subsequently began his working life and political career in the country. He went on to transfer Russia's Crimea province to Kiev in 1954. In fairness, Khrushchev was ethnically Russian but the man who followed him was a genuine Ukrainian. That was Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1964 to 1982. He was born in Kamenskoye, near Dnipropetrovsk. Furthermore, on his own 1947 passport his nationality is listed as Ukrainian. In fact, you could argue that Brezhnev, a man of exquisite tastes, was the Viktor Yanukovich of his day. Let's not forget the KGB either , regarded as the greatest symbol of Russian repression by Ukraine's nationalists. The problem with this yarn is is three of its eight chairmen were born in the country. The head Chekist in the 1961-1967 period was Vladimir Semichastny, from Donbas. While he has was Russian by blood, in 1982, the fully Ukrainian Vitaly Fedorchuk, a native of Zhitomir, took over. He didn't last long, but his successor, who bossed the KGB from 1982 to 1988, was Dnipropetrovsk's Viktor Chebrikov. The Real Agenda The point is that this highly organized PR campaign is trying to create a counter-factual historical narrative. In the new reality, Ukraine is attempting to make itself seem like a victim of 'Soviet Russia' when in fact most of the country was an integral part of the USSR, and very willingly so. Sure, west Ukrainians - mostly centered around Lviv - hated being connected to Moscow, but they have always been a minority inside their own country. Thus, for Ukraine to try team up with Poland and Lithuania now is quite comical. These two countries were invaded by both of the eastern front's main belligerents and suffered greatly. By contrast, what Ukraine endured was overwhelmingly imposed from Berlin. And the fact that over seven million Ukrainians fought in the Red Army is proof positive of where Kiev's loyalties lay in World War II. The problem today is that the post-Maidan regime is in desperate need of new chronicles to underpin its historic shift away from Moscow. Even if they are totally fictional. We also see this in attempts to lionize Stepan Bandera, who much of the country perceives as a Nazi collaborator and whose henchmen carried out the aforementioned Volyn and Galician massacres. The western PR advisers concocting this rubbish might feel they are being clever right now, but in the long term they are dividing Ukrainians once again into eastern and western camps. And when the next inevitable power shift tilts control back in the other direction, the chronology and commemorations will change again. The fact is that Kiev should be seeking a "national idea" which unifies the country. But every time the rulers change, the side in power seeks to impose its interpretation of the past. So long as this continues, Ukraine will never be united and stable. And that's very sad. Bryan MacDonald is an Irish journalist, who is based in Russia Comment: Further reading

Mon, 24 Oct 2016 00:00 UTC © drshel.com Researchers at Oregon State University have found that a specific detoxification compound, glutathione, helps resist the toxic stresses of everyday life -- but its levels decline with age and this sets the stage for a wide range of age-related health problems. A new study, published in the journal Redox Biology , also highlighted a compound -- N-acetyl-cysteine, or NAC -- that is already used in high doses in medical detoxification emergencies. But the researchers said that at much lower levels NAC might help maintain glutathione levels and prevent the routine metabolic declines associated with aging. In that context, the research not only offers some profound insights into why the health of animals declines with age, but specifically points to a compound that might help prevent some of the toxic processes involved. Decline of these detoxification pathways , scientists say, are causally linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer , some of the primary causes of death in the developed world. "We've known for some time of the importance of glutathione as a strong antioxidant," said Tory Hagen, lead author on the research and the Helen P. Rumbel Professor for Health Aging Research in the Linus Pauling Institute at OSU. "What this study pointed out was the way that cells from younger animals are far more resistant to stress than those from older animals," said Hagen, also a professor of biochemistry in the OSU College of Science. "In young animal cells, stress doesn't cause such a rapid loss of glutathione. The cells from older animals, on the other hand, were quickly depleted of glutathione and died twice as fast when subjected to stress. "But pretreatment with NAC increased glutathione levels in the older cells and largely helped offset that level of cell death." Glutathione, Hagen said, is such an important antioxidant that its existence appears to date back as far as oxygen-dependent, or aerobic life itself -- about 1.5 billion years. It's a principal compound to detoxify environmental stresses, air pollutants, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals and many other toxic insults. In this study, scientists tried to identify the resistance to toxins of young cells, compared to those of older cells. They used a toxic compound called menadione to stress the cells, and in the face of that stress the younger cells lost significantly less of their glutathione than older cells did. The glutathione levels of young rat cells never decreased to less than 35 percent of its initial level, whereas in older rat cells glutathione levels plummeted to 10 percent of their original level. NAC, the researchers said, is known to boost the metabolic function of glutathione and increase its rate of synthesis. It's already used in emergency medicine to help patients in a toxic crisis, such as ingestion of poisonous levels of heavy metals. It's believed to be a very safe compound to use even at extremely high levels -- and the scientists are hypothesizing that it might have significant value at much lower doses to maintain glutathione levels and improve health. "I'm optimistic there could be a role for this compound in preventing the increased toxicity we face with aging, as our abilities to deal with toxins decline," Hagen said. "We might be able to improve the metabolic resilience that we're naturally losing with age." Also of interest, Hagen said, is the wide range of apparent detoxification potential offered by glutathione. Higher levels of it -- boosted by NAC -- might help reduce the toxicity of some prescription drugs, cancer chemotherapies , and treat other health issues. "Using NAC as a prophylactic, instead of an intervention, may allow glutathione levels to be maintained for detoxification in older adults," the researchers wrote in their conclusion.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 19:54 UTC © AFP 2016/ BULENT KILIC Commenting on the recent reports that Russia has started exchanging intelligence data with the Turkish Army to ensure the effectiveness of Ankara's Euphrates Shield operation in Syria , retired Turkish Air Force Lt. Gen. Erdogan Karakus told Sputnik that the move signals major changes in Turkish foreign policy. Russia has already started sharing its intelligence data with the Turkish army, which will ensure the effectiveness of Ankara's Euphrates Shield operation in Syria, Russia's Izvestia newspaper reported on Monday. According to the newspaper, the agreement was reached during recent negotiations between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan. First Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Defense and Security at the Federation Council (upper house of parliament) Franz Klintsevich told the newspaper that Turkey quietly joined the intelligence sharing pool created by Russia, Syria, Iraq and Iran . "We pass Turkey data on our radio intercepts, electronic intelligence and imagery intelligence that may be of interest to it," the senator said. "In response, they also share information. Turkey has very effective intelligence agencies and very good agents in Syria ," he added. Commenting on the move, Retired Air Lieutenant General Erdogan Karakus, General President of TESUD (Turkey Retired Officers Association) told Sputnik Turkiye that the pace of development of Russian-Turkish relations amid the mounting tension in Turkish-American relations signifies major changes to Turkish foreign policy. Ankara is demonstrating its readiness to upgrade its cooperation with Moscow to an unprecedented level , creating prerequisites for further strategic partnerships, including in the military-political sphere. "Turkey pays high importance to the Open Skies Treaty. Signed in 1992, it is aimed mainly at strengthening trust between the signatories," Erdogan Karakus told Sputnik. "Unfortunately this February Turkey denied Russia an observation flight over its territory. However the situation has drastically changed since then and Russian inspectors now perform observation flights over Turkey . This is one of the major indications of a new stage in development of Russian-Turkish relations," he added. "The exchange of intelligence data, negotiations on the creation of a Turkish anti-missile defense system with the deployment of Russia's S-300 and S-400 systems, the opening of its territory for observation flights signifies the growing trust in relations between the two countries," Karakus said. Retired Air Lieutenant General noted that such a development is only more natural as the American 'Greater Middle East' project equally worries both Russia and Turkey. To be able to prevent all the threats arising from this project the cooperation between the two countries should be ultimately upgraded to a strategic level. There are no hurdles for the further strategic partnership between the two, Karakus finally stated. Comment: This should pretty much put to rest any speculation that Ankara at risk of coming to the aid of the terrorists in eastern Aleppo. Russia would not develop such close ties with them if there was a risk Turkey would basically go to war against the Syrian army, and thus the Russians as well. In all likelihood, Erdogan is acting within certain clearly defined limits in northern Syria.

Thu, 20 Oct 2016 13:28 UTC © sky32.ddns.net Yahoo has urged the US government to disclose national security orders Washington allegedly issued to obtain user data. It comes after a Reuters report claimed that Yahoo built a software program to search customers' emails for specific US intelligence. The letter to Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James Clapper was released on Yahoo's website on Wednesday. "We urge your office to consider the following actions to provide clarity on the matter: confirm whether an order, as described in these media reports, was issued; declassify in whole or in part such order, if it exists; and make a sufficiently detailed public and contextual comment to clarify the alleged facts and circumstances," the letter read. The company called for an explanation of "under what set of circumstances" the US authorities obtained users' private information. "Citizens in a democracy require such information to understand and debate the appropriateness of such authorities and how the government employs them." According to Yahoo, the report "set a stronger precedent of transparency for our users and all citizens who could be affected by government requests for user data. As we've said before, recent press reports have been misleading; the mail scanning described in the article does not exist on our systems." Timothy Barrett, a spokesman for Clapper's office, confirmed to Reuters that the DNI head had received a letter and "will respond to Yahoo directly." A similar call to the US government has been made by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The group filed a motion to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) requesting the release of court records. "As the revelation of the Yahoo! Order underscores, an unknown number of legal opinions and orders assessing the constitutionality of and statutory basis for the government's surveillance activities remain hidden from the public," the group said in its letter. According to the ACLU motion, "judicial opinions interpreting constitutional and statutory limits on governmental authorities - including those relevance to foreign-intelligence surveillance - have regularly been available for inspection by the public ... their release is manifestly fundamental in a democracy committed to the rule of law." The controversial document, which claims Yahoo built a custom software program to search all of its customers' incoming emails for specific information provided by US intelligence officials, was released October 4. The document, first reported by Reuters, said that a custom software program was secretly built in 2015 to comply with a classified US government directive. The program scanned hundreds of millions of Yahoo Mail accounts, according to the revelations. Under laws including the 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, intelligence agencies can ask American phone and internet companies to provide customer data to aid foreign intelligence-gathering efforts for a variety of reasons, including prevention of terrorist attacks. But it wasn't until the disclosures by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and others who exposed the extent of electronic surveillance on the public that the US government was forced to scale back its program in order to protect privacy rights.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:12 UTC © Daniel Mihailescu / AFP US, Turkey and Poland are among the NATO member states which confirmed their readiness to dispatch naval units to the Black Sea in 2017, boosting the alliance's presence in the region, according to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Stoltenberg noted "progress" in in strengthening NATO's presence in the Black Sea Region in his statement after the meeting of the block's defense ministers in Brussels on Wednesday. "With a Romania-led multinational framework brigade on land and we're working on measures in the air and at sea," he said. According to the secretary General, several member-states " indicated their willingness to contribute to our presence in the Black Sea region on land, at sea and in the air, including Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Turkey and the US ." "Other allies are also looking into how they can contribute," he added. Comment: Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and the US have no business in provoking tensions with Russia in the Black Sea. Of the countries listed, only Turkey has shores on the Black Sea. Interestingly, Bulgaria isn't listed. Perhaps they learned their lesson in botching their involvement in Russia's Nord Stream project. Zing! The plans on enhancing Black Sea presence will be finalized during another meeting on NATO ministers in February. Following Crimea's reunification with Russia, NATO has been increasingly concerned about the Black Sea is turning into a "Russian lake." Since the spring of 2014, NATO warships, including missile cruisers from the US and other allied nations, have been patrolling the Black Sea on a rotational basis, never leaving the area unattended. NATO decided to increase their presence in the Black Sea during a summit in Warsaw in July, calling it a response to Russia's increasing military capabilities and is a gesture of support to its Eastern European members. Comment: Baloney. Eastern European members are under no threat from Russia. This operation is part of the information war to create the image of a Russian threat. The military beef-up in the region is expected lead to the creation of NATO's Black Sea Fleet to be formed by member-states with direct access to the sea. Stoltenberg also said that 17 NATO countries will delegate their units to join the four multinational ground battalions to be deployed in Poland and the Baltic State early next year. The battalions will be led by the US, UK, Canada and Germany, while the countries sending their forces included France, Poland, Albania, Romania, Croatia and others. The Secretary General stressed that NATO was monitoring the movement of Russian vessels in the Baltic Sea. "I can confirm that two Russian warships have recently entered the Baltic Sea, and NATO is monitoring this movement in the way we always do," he said. However, Stoltenberg stressed that, despite its buildup in Eastern Europe, the alliance is ready for dialogue with Moscow. "We are concerned about Russia's behavior. Bur dialogue is even more important when tensions run high. And allies stand ready to hold an ambassadorial meeting of the NATO-Russia Council in the near future," he said.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:35 UTC He roamed the streets of Sacramento for six years, raping women as they walked to work or headed home from parties in the dark. To keep them from fighting back, he smashed their heads with rocks and wrapped his hands around their necks. Sometimes he threatened them with a gun. Police became frustrated, unable to identify him even though they had his DNA from the crimes. Desperate for a break, they checked a database of convicted felons, but came up empty-handed. Finally, they searched for a partial match to see whether he had a relative in the database. They got lucky — the man had a brother in custody, which led authorities to the assailant. The "Roaming Rapist" is one of a handful of cases that California authorities have quietly solved in recent years using a controversial technique that scours an offender DNA database for a father, son or brother of an elusive crime suspect. The state's early success using familial DNA searches to identify the so-called "Grim Sleeper" serial killer led Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck to predict that the method would "change the way policing is done in the United States." Civil liberty groups expressed alarm, saying the searches raised significant ethical and privacy concerns. Some questioned their legality. Since then, familial DNA has made more modest progress than Beck predicted but has also gained wider respect. Eight other states have followed California's lead, formally embracing the technique as a crime-fighting tool. And though many opponents still express concerns, California's approach has won over some previous skeptics who say they are impressed with the state's strict policies limiting its use and the measured successes. Using the method helped detectives in the state identify two murderers, including the Grim Sleeper, and five men wanted for sexual assaults, according to the attorney general's office. Early last year, authorities arrested a San Diego County man accused of sneaking into children's bedrooms and cutting holes in their pajamas before molesting them. A few months later, a Vacaville man was arrested on suspicion of raping and sodomizing a woman along a bike path. A Santa Cruz County judge in 2013 sentenced a man to life in prison for raping a coffee shop employee then barricading her inside a walk-in refrigerator. Lab officials look for a relative by scanning genetic profiles in the offender database and looking for DNA samples that match with a suspect's along several, but not all, markers. From there, California's testing method focuses on part of the Y-chromosome passed down along the male line, identifying father-son or full brother relationships. As more genetic markers for people's DNA are entered into offender databases, the technology will become more precise, said geneticist Frederick Bieber, a professor at Harvard University 's medical school and a leading authority on the technique. That could help officials identify more distant relatives and track down criminals who aren't in the system, he said. "The technology is powerful...there's demonstrable success," Bieber said. Britain pioneered the use of familial DNA for crime solving more than a decade ago. In one of the earliest cases, detectives reopened the 1988 killing of a 20-year-old woman in Wales and compared DNA from the assailant to genetic profiles in Britain's database of known offenders. In 2002, they got a partial match to a 14-year-old boy. The teen wasn't alive at the time of the slaying, but detectives used the clue to focus on his uncle, who eventually pleaded guilty to the murder. Despite that conviction and others, the technology took some time to catch on in the U.S. and was used only sporadically. Among its earliest uses was the 2005 Kansas arrest of Dennis Rader, the BTK serial killer, which came after officials subpoenaed a tissue sample from his daughter's Pap smear taken at a medical clinic. © Travis Heying / Los Angeles Times A familial DNA test led to the arrest of Dennis L. Rader, shown making a court appearance via video feed, in the BTK ("bind, torture and kill") serial murder case in Kansas. By 2007, an impassioned debate on the technology was percolating at the Capitol in Sacramento. Gov. Jerry Brown — then the state's attorney general — began fielding letters and visits from prosecutors, urging him to consider using familial DNA. His advisers, however, were concerned approving the method might cause federal judges to shut down the whole database on constitutional grounds. In 2008, Brown enacted a comprehensive familial DNA policy — making California the first state in the country to do so. Under the policy, familial DNA is only to be used as a "last resort" when all other investigative angles have been exhausted. So far, the state Department of Justice has run 156 familial searches, many of them repeat queries, such as in the Grim Sleeper case. An initial search turned up nothing, but state officials ran another scan in 2010. A partial match came back to a man added to the database after a 2008 arrest for firearm and drug offenses. Detectives zeroed in on the man's father, Lonnie Franklin Jr., who lived close to where many of the victims' bodies were dumped in South L.A. Detectives believe Franklin killed at least 25 women over more than two decades . He was sentenced to death in August. Nabbing Franklin changed things for now-UCLA Law School Dean Jennifer Mnookin, who once condemned using DNA to find suspects by searching for relatives. Mnookin argued that the method invades privacy rights and is racially discriminatory because African Americans and Latinos are disproportionately represented in DNA databases. Although she still worries about the racial disparity, she said her view shifted after seeing the effect on big cases, such as Franklin's, and how infrequently the technology is used. "If it's helping us solve big cases," Mnookin said, "it seems like a worthwhile trade-off." Eight other states — Colorado, Wisconsin, Virginia, Michigan, Texas, Wyoming, Utah and Florida — have protocols for the use of familial DNA, and the technology has also been used informally by agencies elsewhere. But the growing popularity of the technique has raised alarms for some privacy advocates, such as Steve Mercer, chief attorney for the forensic division of the Maryland Office of the Public Defender. Mercer successfully lobbied for his state's formal ban on familial searches. Washington, D.C., is the only other jurisdiction to prohibit them outright. Searching for relatives through partial matches is intrusive, he said, and raises concerns about the 4th Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure. "It is a slippery slope," he said. Critics also warn that partial matches can point authorities to innocent people. In 2014, the technology led police in an Idaho city to wrongfully suspect a New Orleans filmmaker of committing a notorious 1996 murder. Police homed in on him after examining an online database of genetic profiles. One profile, which was a near match to DNA left at the crime scene, belonged to a man who had donated his DNA years earlier to a hereditary studies project conducted by the Mormon church. An ancestry research company purchased the program's database, making it publicly available. Idaho Falls police obtained a court order compelling the company to turn over the identity of the man, who detectives thought could be related to the killer. Once they had his name, they scrubbed his family and focused on the man's son, Michael Usry. Detectives flew to New Orleans and interrogated him for more than three hours, before ordering him to provide a cheek swab. Usry asked whether someone he knew had committed a heinous crime. No, the detectives told him, they were looking at him. He waited anxiously for a month, wondering whether he'd be wrongfully arrested. Finally, an email came. "Mr. Usry," it read, "your DNA did not match with our case. Sorry for the inconvenience." The science is complicated and his experience shows it isn't the "perfect system" some supporters make it out to be, said Usry, now 37 and living in Colorado. "I'm still just scratching my head," he said. "Civil rights are being taken from us at an alarming rate." Still, supporters of familial DNA searches point to its successes. Sacramento's "Roaming Rapist," Dereck Sanders, spent 14 years on the loose, attacking women in the late-1990s and early-2000s. He sexually assaulted 10 victims, including two teenagers,14 and 15, who sneaked out one night to meet up with friends. Officials ran his DNA and began trailing Sanders, whose brother — a convicted rapist — was in the offender DNA database. Sacramento sheriff's deputies followed him to a McDonald's drive-thru, where he ordered a Happy Meal, and then to a park where he ate and threw away his trash. Detectives retrieved the garbage and took it back to the county's crime lab. There, officials tested the DNA from a straw Sanders had used. It was a match. "That was one of the happiest meals we ever had," said Rob Gold, the supervising deputy district attorney who prosecuted Sanders. "It would not have been solved without familial DNA." Sanders' 14-year-old victim, who is now 33, said the rape destroyed her for years. She obsessed over maintaining control in all situations and felt paranoid. She watched until her girlfriends walked into their homes and shut the door behind them, but still found herself texting them to double-check that they were safe. ( The Times generally does not identify victims of sex crimes.) She got counseling and tried to understand the different ways the rape had affected her. Still, the same two questions often came to mind. Is he hurting anyone else, she wondered? Will I ever get the chance to look him in the eye? The answer came in the fall of 2014 at Sanders' trial, where she testified against him. He was convicted of multiple counts of sexual assault and sentenced to life in prison. To her, the question of whether to use the technology is almost silly. "It's out there, it's available," she said. "Do it." Authorities in California have used familial DNA searches to solve several murder and sexual assault cases: Lonnie Franklin Jr. The "Grim Sleeper" serial killer prowled the streets of South L.A. for more than two decades. After getting a partial DNA hit to his son in 2010, authorities charged Franklin with killing nine women and a teenage girl. He was convicted earlier this year and sentenced to death. Elvis Garcia A man sexually assaulted a barista in a Santa Cruz coffee shop in 2008, threatening her with a knife and barricading her inside a walk-in refrigerator. In 2011, a partial hit to the assailant's father led police to Garcia, who was convicted of sodomy and sentenced to 65 years to life in prison. James Brown The 1978 slaying of a 26-year-old woman in an Orange County parking lot remained unsolved for three decades until familial DNA helped lead authorities to Brown, who died in 1996 and had been cremated. Forensic scientists used a DNA sample from his son to confirm Brown was the killer. Dereck Sanders Beginning in the late 1990s, the "Roaming Rapist" sexually assaulted women and girls across Sacramento County. Sheriff's deputies arrested Sanders in 2012 after a crime lab got a partial hit to his brother, a convicted rapist. Sanders is serving life in prison. Michael Simpson In 2002, a man raped and beat a 55-year-old woman behind a store in Sunnyvale. Using a familial DNA search, police identified Simpson as a suspect. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Gilbert Chavarria During a heat wave in the summer of 2013, when many people left their windows cracked open, a San Diego County man snuck into the bedrooms of six children and cut holes in their pajamas before molesting them. Authorities said a familial DNA hit ultimately led them to arrest Chavarria. He has pleaded not guilty. Jeremy Delaunay In the summer of 2014, a teenager in Vacaville sexually assaulted a woman along a bike path before stealing her jewelry. A year later, authorities arrested Delaunay. He is serving six years in prison after pleading guilty to rape.

Thu, 20 Oct 2016 20:46 UTC © NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/GSFC This composite image depicts Jupiter's cloud formations as seen through the eyes of Juno's microwave radiometer (MWR) instrument as compared to the top layer, a Cassini imaging science subsystem image of the planet. The MWR can see a couple of hundred miles into Jupiter's atmosphere with the instrument's largest antenna. The belts and bands visible on the surface are also visible in modified form in each layer below. Jupiter's stripes are more than skin deep, according to observations by NASA's Juno probe, which has revealed many new surprises about the Jovian giant. Juno arrived at the Jupiter system in July. On Aug. 27, the probe made a close flyby of the planet, during which, the science team was supposed to calibrate Juno's instruments and get familiar with the intense environment around Jupiter, according to Juno principal investigator Scott Bolton. But the encounter proved more fruitful than expected. Jupiter's bold, colorful stripes are clouds, and optical light can't penetrate them to see what's underneath. However, Juno is carrying microwave instruments that can each probe those clouds to different depths; together, these instruments can effectively peel back the clouds like layers of an onion. An artist's impression based on the microwave data reveals a striking feature: Some of the stripes are visible deep into the cloud layers. "The structure of the zones and belts still exists deep down," Bolton said during a news conference at the 2016 meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences. "So whatever's making those colors, whatever's making those stripes, is still existing pretty far down into Jupiter. That came as a surprise to many of the scientists. We didn't know if this was [just] skin-deep." The new images penetrate to depths of about 200 to 250 miles (350 to 400 kilometers) below the surface cloud layer, Bolton said. He noted that the bands seen on the cloud tops are not identical to the bands seen in the subsequent layers, although there is clearly a strong similarity. "They're evolving. They're not staying the same," Bolton said. The finding "hints [at] the deep dynamics and the chemistry of Jupiter's atmosphere. And this is the first time we've seen any giant planet atmosphere underneath its layers. So we're learning about atmospheric dynamics at a very basic level." Another breathtaking result came from the JunoCam , a visible-light camera that is being used for public outreach. The instrument took a snapshot of Jupiter's terminator line, or the place where night turns to day. As is the case with viewing the moon's terminator line, the change in light casts shadows, allowing viewers to see many features in three dimensions (like being able to see the depth of craters on the moon). In the Juno photo, scientists spotted a cyclone rising above the main atmospheric layer. The storm appears to be about 52 miles (85 km) tall and about 4,300 miles (7,000 km) wide, which is more than half the width of the Earth. © NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/Alex Mai The sunlit part of Jupiter was created by a citizen scientist (Alex Mai) using data from Juno's JunoCam instrument. JunoCam's raw images are available at www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam for the public to peruse and process into image products. The first flyby also demonstrated that scientists have a lot to learn about what's happening inside Jupiter, the researchers said. The Juno team discovered that very close to the planet, Jupiter's magnetic field, its auroras and its gravitational field (that is, the characteristics of the planet's gravity at different points in space) all provided surprises. The auroras on Jupiter, which were first spotted by the Hubble Space Telescope, are not unlike the northern and southern lights that flash in the polar skies on Earth. But the data collected by Juno on Aug. 27 has thrown into question the models scientists had for Jupiter's auroras. "Nothing about the aurora that we measured on Aug. 27 was as expected," Bolton said during a talk at the meeting. The probe flew over the auroras with multiple instruments turned on, but "the things we expected to see weren't there, and things we didn't expect were there. "We're sort of sorting it out," Bolton said. "We've certainly got a mission of discovery [with regard to] the aurora and understanding that complex system." In addition, measurements of the planet's magnetic field matched planetary models fairly well as Juno sped toward Jupiter. But in the last few minutes before the probe reached its closest point of approach to the planet, the data drastically diverged from the predictions, showing that the magnetic field was much stronger than expected, Bolton said. That implies that the internal magnetic field is "much more complex than people thought" he said. But, of course, Bolton noted, no probe has ever come this close to Jupiter before, and the purpose of the Juno mission is to gather data that will put models like those to the test. More surprises came from preliminary measurements of Jupiter's gravitational field (that is, the strength and direction of the planet's gravity at different points in space). Bolton said the Juno team members who made initial models of the planet's internal gravity field "are already having to redo the field model" based on those early measurements. "The internal gravity field also holds a lot of guarded secrets that are going to help us understand Jupiter," he said. © NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/ASI/INAF/JIRAM An infrared image of the southern aurora of Jupiter, captured by NASA's Juno spacecraft on Aug. 27, 2016. More science to come Juno's orbit around Jupiter isn't circular. Instead, the probe makes a loop that takes it right up next to the planet — to within 3,100 miles (5,000 km) of the cloud tops — and then far out into space, before looping back in for another close pass. Jupiter is surrounded by a donut-shaped ring of very intense radiation that could easily destroy most electronic equipment. Juno, with its unique orbit, does a thread-the-needle maneuver, slipping between the planet and the radiation ring. Right now, Juno makes one orbit every 53 days. Juno was scheduled to fire its engines on Oct. 19 and reduce its orbit to every 14 days. Because of a problem with the engine valves, the Juno team has delayed that engine firing until the issue can be diagnosed. Juno is still able to complete its science mission if it stays in the 53-day orbit, Bolton said.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:25 UTC © NASA/CXC/UA/J.Irwin et al. In this Chandra X-ray Observatory image of NGC 5128 (also known as Centaurus A), low, medium, and high-energy X-rays are coloured red, green, and blue. Five flares were detected from the source located near NGC 5128, which is at a distance of about 14 million light-years from Earth. A movie showing the average change in X-rays for the three flares with the most complete Chandra data, covering both the rise and fall, is shown in the inset. Astronomers have found a pair of extraordinary cosmic objects that dramatically burst in X-rays. This discovery, obtained with NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and ESA's XMM-Newton observatory, may represent a new class of explosive events found in space. The mysterious X-ray sources flare up and become about a hundred times brighter in less than a minute, before returning to original X-ray levels after about an hour. At their peak, these objects qualify as ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) that give off hundreds to thousands of times more X-rays than typical binary systems where a star is orbiting a black hole or neutron star. "We've never seen anything like this," said Jimmy Irwin of the University of Alabama, who led the study that appears in the latest issue of the journal Nature . "Astronomers have seen many different objects that flare up, but these may be examples of an entirely new phenomenon." While magnetars — young neutron stars with powerful magnetic fields — have been known to produce bright and rapid flares in X-rays, these newly discovered objects are different in key ways. First, magnetars only take a few seconds to tens of seconds to decline in X-rays after a flare. Secondly, these new flaring objects are found in populations of old stars in elliptical galaxies, which are spherical or egg-shaped galaxies that are composed mostly of older stars. This makes it unlikely that these new flaring objects are young, astronomically speaking, like magnetars are thought to be. Also, these objects are brighter in X-rays during their "calm" periods. "These flares are extraordinary," said Peter Maksym, a co-author from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. "For a brief period, one of the sources became one of the brightest ULX to ever be seen in an elliptical galaxy." When they are not flaring, these sources appear to be normal binary systems where a black hole or neutron star is pulling material from a companion star similar to the Sun. This indicates that the flares do not significantly disrupt the binary system. While the nature of these flares is unknown, the team has begun to search for answers. One idea is that the flares represent episodes when matter being pulled away from a companion star falls rapidly onto a black hole or neutron star. This could happen when the companion makes its closest approach to the compact object in an eccentric orbit. Another explanation could involve matter falling onto an intermediate-mass black hole, with a mass of about 800 times that of the Sun for one source and 80 times that of the Sun for the other. "Now that we've discovered these flaring objects, observational astronomers and theorists alike are going to be working hard to figure out what's happening," said co-author Gregory Sivakoff of the University of Alberta. One of the sources, located near and presumably associated with the galaxy NGC 4636 at a distance of 47 million light-years, was observed with Chandra to flare once. Five flares were detected from the other source, which is located near the galaxy NGC 5128 at a distance of 14 million light-years. Four of these flares were seen with Chandra and one with XMM-Newton. The team looked at the X-ray variation of several thousand X-ray sources in Chandra observations of 70 nearby galaxies. Although several examples of flaring X-ray sources were found, none exhibited the behaviour of the giant rapid flares reported here.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:37 UTC © AFP The Pentagon loves to throw good money after bad ‒ to the tune of nearly $60 billion on failed big-ticket weapons systems over the last two decades, according to a new internal Department of Defense review. From the Army's Future Combat Systems (FCS) that focused on fighting the last war to its RAH-66 Comanche stealth helicopters that never quite got off the ground, between 1997 and October 2016, the Pentagon invested $58 billion on weapons technology it never received. That doesn't include the boondoggle that is the F-35 jet , which was finally declared "ready for combat" at the beginning of August. The FCS ($20 billion) and the Comanche ($9.8 billion) are just two of 23 major weapons programs that were canceled before they were finished, and together the two Army projects made up more than 50 percent of the "sunk costs" outlined in the Pentagon's annual internal acquisitions performance review. The 224-page report by Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall was published earlier this week. The report noted how much money was spent on each canceled program, how far along in the process they were before they were killed, and if any of the technology was rolled up into new programs. For example, although the FCS was canceled, parts of it ‒ including many of the manned ground vehicles and the Intelligent Munitions System ‒ were swept up into a current program called the Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization Program. Most of the programs were killed before they blew through their budgets, but eight of them spent all the money allotted to them before the Pentagon canceled them, the report found. The Government Accountability Office, a Congressional watchdog, conducted an audit of Pentagon spending in 2011 and found $70 billion in waste, the New York Times reported at the time . Much of the overspending happened because the DOD started building weapons systems before the designs were fully tested, the auditors said. With acquisitions overruns long being a thorn in the side of the Pentagon's budget, in March the Air Force enlisted IBM's Jeopardy! -winning cognitive computer , Watson. Two contractors are currently working to create programs that would enable Watson to navigate the 1,897-page Federal Acquisition Regulation, helping potential government vendors actually bid for military contracts. The project is expected to become operational by 2018. Another way the Pentagon has sought to cut down wasted spending is through the latest update to its acquisitions program, called 'Better Buying Power 3.0', which was announced in April 2015 . The program was designed to have "a stronger emphasis on innovation, technical excellence, and the quality of our products," Kendall wrote in a memo ordering the program's implementation. It calls on the military-industrial complex to make projects more affordable in terms of funding, schedule and manpower throughout the entire lifespan of their products. It will also reward contractors for successful expense management, and ask them to eliminate unproductive processes and unnecessary bureaucracy. Of course, holding contractors accountable for their failures when it comes to major cost overruns or weapons systems that don't work is easier said than done. And it doesn't help when someone at the Pentagon thinks it's a good idea to spend money on bomb-sniffing elephants .

Radio Free Europe Tue, 25 Oct 2016 20:50 UTC Azem Syla is a former member of parliament and prominent politician in President Hashim Thaci's (pictured) ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK). An international prosecutor has charged an ally of Kosovo's President Hashim Thaci with leading a crime ring responsible for a multimillion-dollar land scam and money laundering. The European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) made the charges against Azem Syla and 38 associates on October 25. Syla is a former member of parliament and prominent politician in Thaci's ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK). In a statement, Kosovo prosecutor's office said Syla's crime syndicate was involved in illegally acquiring public property in Kosovo worth around $33 million. The prosecutor's office added that the 39 defendants cooperated "to deprive Kosovo of socially owned properties through criminal activities including the falsification of verdicts and of other official documents, fraud and corrupt behavior." Prosecutors said the criminal gang had been operating since 2006. Syla, 65, was arrested in April after he surrendered to authorities. He was a top commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army during the Kosovo War.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 21:10 UTC © Jonathan Ernst / Reuters The Kingdom of Bahrain's authoritarian ruler King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa visited British Prime Minister Theresa May at Downing Street on Wednesday, despite outcry from human rights and anti-arms trade groups. The Gulf regime is a close ally of both the UK and Saudi Arabia, as well as being a major UK arms customer, and is currently bearing much of the cost for building the Royal Navy's new Mina Salman naval base. Human rights groups have highlighted widespread abuses committed by Bahraini government forces against pro-democracy activists during the 2011 Arab Spring. The king's visit was met with protests by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, and Campaign against the Arms Trade (CAAT) on Wednesday afternoon. Two activists were escorted away by police. Already in 2016, senior British Royals, who are known for their closeness to the Gulf monarchies, have been criticized for meeting the Bahraini monarchy both in the UK and during trips to the nation. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will soon visit Bahrain on behalf of the UK government, despite long-standing concerns over human rights abuses and UK arms sales. In April, a report for the Foreign Affairs Select Committee blasted Bahrain's record on human rights abuses, not least during the violent crushing of Arab Spring protests with the direct support of another controversial UK ally, Saudi Arabia. The report also argued that human rights had effectively been downgraded by the UK government in a bid to shore up relations with the authoritarian state, which enjoys arms trading and security arrangements with Britain. A broad campaign is currently underway, including MPs, to put a halt to UK arms sales to the Saudi regime in light of repeated reports of war crimes in its UK-assisted aerial bombing campaign in Yemen.

Fri, 21 Oct 2016 21:32 UTC Clinton can't draw crowds this large The question regarding the meaning of Trump is unlike questions concerning the person of Trump or what the Republican candidates stands for. The meaning of Trump is that, pretty much, half of the American people say enough is enough. Half of the American people are expressing a total fatigue of the system and their ruling elite. In the last few weeks we learned that Trump left behind a score of offended women. He was disrespectful and grossly misbehaved, allegedly. This may tell us something about who Trump is; yet the fact that all those embarrassing revelations had zero impact on Trump's popularity suggests that we are dealing with a force of nature. No one else in modern politics would have survived a fraction of such bad publicity. Trump may be a horrid and disrespectful human being, and yet, he appears to be invincible. Trump is not as eloquent or as lucid as Hillary Clinton or President Obama but he manages to express in a just a few words the deepest and most profound philosophical ideas and criticisms of Western life. It was Trump who reminded us, once again, that true utopia is in fact nostalgia. Trump's campaign slogan 'Make America Great Again' is probably the most profound existential rejection of the progressive delusional mantra. It is an essentialist admission that the prospect of a better future is actually rooted in the past, in the soil, in manufacturing and agriculture -- pretty much the few things from which Wall Street's mammonites were happy to divest . Trump hinted in the last debate that he may challenge the result of the US presidential election if he loses. "I'll keep you in suspense," is how he phrased it. Once again, Trump is not a philosophy graduate, yet, he manages to unleash an existential viper into the room. Secretary Clinton and President Obama were appalled by the man who doesn't adhere to the great American democratic tradition. They were probably correct. Trump, puts into question the entire American or, more accurately, Western paradigm. Democracy is not sacred to him - it is a means rather than the end. Like the vast number of his followers, Trump believes that America and its democracy are currently rotten. American democracy is set up to serve its own oligarchy. It conveys the image that the dystopia in which we live is a product of our 'free (democratic) choice'. While Clinton and Obama communicate persuasively within the symbolic order, Trump manages to revolutionize the discourse constantly. This is a quality that is usually associated with the artist and the Athenian spirit not with real estate moguls. But does Trump really mean what he says? Is he genuine or is he playing a game. No one knows. But far more interesting, no one really cares and it doesn't really matter. And this is probably the real meaning of Trump. Donald Trump is merely a vehicle. It doesn't really matter whether Trump will be the next president or not. The call for a radical social change has been established. It is now becoming aware of itself.

March 2, 2016: Zika PAYDAY! Obama wants to funnel $1.8 billion for vaccine research and more I even published a mini-documentary revealing the published science that shows how DEET insecticide causes brain damage in humans. You can watch it at this link or view the video below: If anyone from the Washington Post bothered to read Natural News and learn about real science, they would have learned that Zika has infected tens of millions of people throughout South America for decades, with absolutely no measurable increase in neurological deformations. (But facts be damned, the WashPost had a panic to push!) Nation after nation records tens of thousands of infections with ZERO birth defects...Despite the factual reality of the situation, the state-controlled propagandists writing for rags like the Washington Post - a bogus newspaper that has lost all credibility in the minds of intelligent people - continued to pummel home their kooky science theories that claimed much of the U.S. South would be overrun by brain damaging mosquitoes, turning Southerners into shrunken-brained mutants while pregnant women fled northward to survive the airborne insect onslaught. Instead, nothing happened. No explosion in shrunken-headed babies. No wave of birth defects across Florida, even as city officials desperately bombarded their own cities with brain-damaging insecticides. No national emergency declared by Obama to bring back DDT and eradicate baby-murdering mosquitoes by dousing our open streets with thick clouds of organophosphate neurotoxins. Instead, the rate of neurological birth defects in most countries approached zero. Via the Washington Post 's own graphic: (partial list) Venezuela: 60,791 Zika infections... ZERO birth defects Honduras: 31,933 Zika infections... ONE birth defect Guadalupe: 30,969 Zika infections... ZERO birth defects Puerto Rico: 29,084 Zika infections... TWO birth defects Mexico: 4,837 Zika infections... ZERO birth defects From the WashPost article: Brazilian officials were bracing for a flood of fetal deformities as Zika spread this year to other regions of the country, Marinho said. However, "we are not seeing a big increase." Gee, really? The vast majority of the brain defects, it turns out, came from just one small region of Brazil. A total of 2,033 children are so far recorded with neurological defects there, even while most other countries throughout the region had ZERO birth defects (or near zero). So what gives? Zika mosquitoes apparently carry geopolitical maps so they can solely target Brazil You don't have to be a genius to figure out that the stupid science theories of the mainstream media are total hokum and bunk. If Zika really did cause brain defects, it would have spread all across South America by now. It would have spread into Florida, California, Mississippi and Louisiana. It would have devastated the American South, Cuba, Haiti, Curacao and all the other island nations across the Caribbean. Yet the neurological defects were limited almost exclusively to Brazil. Somehow, if we believe the illiterate Washington Post science writers - who may in fact be the only brain damage victims of Zika in North America -- mosquitoes carry MAPS to make sure they only activate their brain damage voodoo in Brazil. "...[A]lthough the outbreak has spread this year to more than 50 nations and territories across the Western Hemisphere, U.N. data shows just 142 cases of congenital birth defects linked to Zika so far outside Brazil," says WashPost . Yes, my friends: GPA-carrying Zika mosquitoes are very careful to limit their pandemic voodoo to just one region of Brazil. By sheer coincidence, that's the same region where larvacide chemicals were dumped into the public water supply. Apparently, there isn't a single "official" scientist in the entire global government who has thought to test the water. Just freaking WOW... Let's throw these morons out of power in every election, okay? They don't deserve any positions of authority over anyone else. They're all so incredibly stupid, they couldn't survive at all unless they functioned as parasites on the taxpayers. They aren't giving up hope just yet... science writers desperately hope for more brain damaged babies to prove them right Enthusiasm for more brain damaged babies runs high at the Washington Post , which explains why they are all in for Hillary Clinton, the candidate of choice for brain damaged adults. Writing with a sense of real enthusiasm, the Washington Post can't wait for more brain damaged babies to appear: Scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are closely watching Puerto Rico, which has reported more than 26,800 cases of Zika. More than 7,000 pregnant women could be infected by the end of the year, according to the CDC.(Yippee?) And now, the loony tunes quack science of the Zika "scientists" goes apoplectic, grasping for silly metaphors to try to obscure the fact that they are all stupid beyond belief. Via the WashPost: "Now we've settled on Zika as the smoking gun, but we don't know who pulled the trigger," said Marques, speaking from Recife, where he is working with government researchers. Huh? Wha? The metaphor doesn't even make any sense. Maybe the problem is too much fornicating. Seriously, this is now part of their idiotic theory: "Sexual habits and hygiene may also play a role," he said, explaining that researchers are looking at whether sexual transmission can infect the uterus and placenta with the virus, potentially exposing the fetus to elevated risk. "We suspect the villain has an accomplice, but we don't know who it is," Marques said. Huh? Do they seriously think that people only have sex in Brazil but not other South American countries? Where does the Washington Post find these morons? I'm a real scientist saying all this As you read all this, remember that I have rapidly become one of the world's leading research scientists on the quantitation of cannabinoids in hemp extracts using mass spec instrumentation. I led the team that developed the most pioneering (and accurate) CBD mass spec analysis method in existence today. You can read about it at this link . I also routinely test water, food and environmental samples for heavy metals, pesticides and a multitude of chemical contaminants. When I say these Zika scientists are complete morons, that's the educated opinion of an accomplished scientist correctly pointing out the lunacy of Zika scaremongering. I could have solved this entire problem in the first few days by analyzing and detecting brain-damaging larvacide chemicals in the public water supply in Eastern Brazil. The entire project would have taken just a few days and cost almost nothing. Instead, Obama handed $1.8 billion to the vaccine companies in the midst of the Zika panic pushed by laughable rags like the Washington Post . It's all a racket, of course, just like their coverage of elections and political candidates. Everything you read at the Washington Post is a deception of one kind or another. The paper exists solely to promote the propaganda of the state so that the population can be manipulated and controlled. The Washington Post exists to terrorize the citizens with fascist propaganda parading as science As you've also learned by now, the corrupt leftist establishment of junk science, criminal politicians and idiotic journalists isn't interested in legitimate scientific solutions. They all function as extensions of a fascist state that must routinely terrorize its citizens with pandemic boogeyman scare stories in order to demand absolute obedience to the vaccine mandates that actually do damage the brains of children. Thus, SCIENCE be damned. They've got an agenda to push, and it doesn't matter to them whether that agenda is based on a single shred of real science.

Thu, 31 Mar 1994 21:37 UTC 'Magic trick!' Washington — The White House has portrayed the commodities market trading that netted First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton almost $100,000 in a two-year period as a case of an ordinary small investor who took her chances and came up a winner with shrewd judgment and a little guidance from an experienced friend. But experts and officials in the volatile futures trading industry said Wednesday that what she did would be highly unusual for the average small investor to pull off successfully . And many commodities trading firms would never have allowed such an investor to try it. For one thing, the experts said, her activities involved exposure to possible losses in the unpredictable market for farm commodities futures that substantially exceeded the available capital--losses that potentially could have been greater than her family's net worth if the market had turned sharply against her. Normally, commodities specialists said, an inexperienced investor with such limited assets would not be allowed to run the risks Mrs. Clinton did unless she had the backing of--and perhaps financial guarantees from--a wealthy backer. At the time she made her huge profits, starting with an initial capital investment of just $1,000, Bill Clinton was a rising political star in Arkansas but he and his wife had only modest assets. They did not even own their own home. Yet Mrs. Clinton took surprisingly large positions in cattle futures, earning one-day profits as high as $30,000 . Had the market moved the other way, she could have lost huge amounts virtually overnight, according to market specialists. The White House has insisted that Mrs. Clinton risked her own money, made all decisions herself about when to buy and sell and bore full responsibility for any losses. They have said that she got advice from prominent Arkansas lawyer James B. Blair, but also consulted other advisers and studied the market through the Wall Street Journal . Futures market analysts and officials who have examined the records of her activities, however, question whether a responsible broker would have allowed her to trade the way she did without some kind of financial protection. One commodity trader with 30 years' experience who reviewed the records of Mrs. Clinton's market activity said that her account is highly unusual, both in the frequency and size of trades and in the small amount of capital behind them . "There's no way in the world that Hillary Clinton should have been trading 50 (cattle futures) contracts. That's 2 million pounds of beef. The risk posture is just not consistent with (the Clintons') income and net worth," said this trader, who works for one of the nation's biggest brokerage houses. "We would not let either one of them (the Clintons) trade commodities. In the late 1970s, we required a couple hundred thousand dollars in liquid net worth before we let them in the door to trade commodities . This is not for the faint of heart," the broker said. Another commodities trader, Phil Tiger of Smith Barney Shearson, described the First Lady's successful trading as "unusual and fortuitous, and her timing was perfect." He said that she entered the market just at a point of rocketing growth and rode it until she had made a small fortune. "It surprised me she stuck it out as long as she did. Most novices just take their profits and get out," Tiger said. But other market experts noted that s hortly after Mrs. Clinton ceased trading, her broker, Robert L. (Red) Bone, and the brokerage company, Ray E. Friedman & Co., were disciplined by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for "serious and repeated" violations of exchange rules on margin requirements and record-keeping functions at their Springdale, Ark., office. Margin is the amount of cash a trader must put up versus the amount of borrowed money used to make the investment. Bone was suspended from trading for three years. The brokerage was fined $250,000. White House officials have said that Mrs. Clinton was unaware of allegations that her brokerage was allocating successful trades to clients or that Bone had previously been suspended for trading violations. Elliot Bercovitz, vice president for strategic planning at Lind-Waldock Inc., of Chicago, one of the nation's leading commodities trading firms, said that it was possible at the time to turn a small stake into $100,000 with savvy trading in the booming market in cattle futures. But one transaction caught his and a number of other brokers' attention: the very first trade in October, 1978, when her account balance went from her initial $1,000 investment to $6,300 in one day. There is no documentation for what was traded at what price, but some brokers said that she could not possibly have had enough in her account to cover the large position in cattle futures that she would have had to take to make that much profit that quickly. " There are holes in these records ," said John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Assn. and a former official in the Richard Nixon Administration who examined the Clinton trading records. "They show the original $1,000 and next day $6,000. How does that compute? "Her $1,000 wouldn't margin the cattle position on that day, necessary to create the profit on the next day. Maybe there was more than $1,000 up front, maybe there were some guarantees." "Most firms weren't taking small individual investors like Hillary Clinton. This is a professional's business. But somehow, Hillary Clinton made $100,000 very quickly , and I would be remiss as president of the FIA to allow the general public to believe this is commonplace," Damgard said. Neither Blair nor Bone was authorized to trade on Mrs. Clinton's behalf, White House officials said. Blair offered "advice but no guarantees," said a senior White House official familiar with Mrs. Clinton's trading who asked not to be named. "He wasn't backing her trades and he wasn't custodian of her account," the official said. On Wednesday, Blair and Bone did not respond to telephone calls from The Times . The White House official familiar with Mrs. Clinton's trading said that the initial $6,300 profit was based on a single futures trade but that the First Lady could not locate the documentation for it. From that first trade, Mrs. Clinton traded aggressively, staking out ever-larger positions and booking profits of more than 3 to 1 over losses. When the market began to go sour in May and June, Mrs. Clinton switched from betting on rising cattle prices--taking a "long" position--to betting that the market would fall, or selling "short." In June, she took a very large short position in cattle futures, selling them three weeks later in mid-July for a quick profit of almost $25,000. Her boldness astounded market observers who have reviewed her record. "That was a very large and aggressive position. . . . This is heavy-duty trading by someone who was not averse to taking risk," said Bercovitz. After that series of trades, Mrs. Clinton stopped trading, took a check for $60,000 from Friedman & Co. and never re-entered the market in any substantial way. "She got the money and walked away," Bercovitz said. "You've got to give her credit." Other brokers question how she could have taken such risks without the means to cover potential losses. " It would take a person of enormous wealth to take on 50 contracts of cattle, as she did ," said a trader involved in similar transactions at the time. "If they lost, where would the Clintons come up with $100,000 to pay for it? They didn't have it." Comment: She may have had an 'in' with people setting cattle prices. As for collateral, the Clintons were in the business of collecting secrets and trading political favors (also known as blackmailing). They never had any problem getting rich with other people's money.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 23:19 UTC An expansive new analysis by Yale School of Public Health researchers confirms that numerous carcinogens involved in the controversial practice of hydraulic fracturing have the potential to contaminate air and water in nearby communities. Fracking is now common in the United States, currently occurring in 30 states, and with millions of people living within one mile of a fracking site . The study suggests that the presence of carcinogens involved in or released by hydraulic fracturing operations has the potential to increase the risk of childhood leukemia. The presence of chemicals alone does not confirm exposure or risk of exposure to carcinogens and future studies are needed to evaluate cancer risk. "Because children are a particularly vulnerable population, research efforts should first be directed toward investigating whether exposure to hydraulic fracturing is associated with an increased risk," said lead author Nicole Deziel, Ph.D., assistant professor. Childhood leukemia is a particular concern because of the severity and short latency period of the disease. The study is published in the journal Science of the Total Environment . The team examined an extensive list of more than 1,000 chemicals that may be released into air or water as a result of fracking. "Previous studies have examined the carcinogenicity of more selective lists of chemicals," said Deziel. "To our knowledge, our analysis represents the most expansive review of carcinogenicity of hydraulic fracturing-related chemicals in the published literature." According to the findings, the majority of chemicals (>80 percent) lacked sufficient data on cancer-causing potential, highlighting an important knowledge gap. Of the 119 compounds with sufficient data, 44 percent of the water pollutants and 60 percent of air pollutants were either confirmed or possible carcinogens. Because some chemicals could be released to both air and water, t he study revealed a total of 55 unique compounds with carcinogenic potential . Furthermore, 20 chemicals had evidence of increased risk for leukemia or lymphoma specifically. This analysis creates a priority list of carcinogens to target for future exposure and health studies. Fracking, also known as unconventional oil and gas development, has increased dramatically in recent years, and the practice is expected to grow in the future. The process involves drilling deep, as far as two miles, into the earth and releasing a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals that fracture the rock and release the gas or oil trapped inside. While fracking increases the production of domestic oil and natural gas and decreases prices, it is controversial because of the significant amounts of water that must be used as well as transported to fracking sites, as well as the release of carcinogens. The team has begun been testing air and water samples for some of these known and suspected carcinogens in a community with particularly intense exposure to fracking to evaluate whether people there are exposed to these compounds, and if so, at what concentrations.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 23:00 UTC Authorities in North Dakota may be feeling the heat from the international attention the Dakota Access Pipeline is getting. They're now saying they lack the manpower to remove the encampment of protesters located on federal land near the controversial pipeline. The announcement may signal a softening of the treatment the protesters, up until now, have been receiving. For months now, The Free Thought Project 's spotlight has been shining on the, some might say, dark and dirty deeds of law enforcement and their treatment of largely Native American peaceful protesters. Attack dogs were unleashed on the protesters in September, injuring six, and an additional 30 protesters, including children, were sprayed with pepper spray. In all, more than 260 people have reportedly been arrested since the protests began in Morton County — over 100 this weekend alone. The sheriff's office's announcement comes just two days after The Free Thought Project encouraged readers to contact Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier's office demanding him to allow for peaceful protest, even providing a link to a petition for his removal. Spokeswoman Donnell Preskey told The Associated Press the department doesn't "have the manpower" to remove the more than 100 protesters from the property. "We can't right now," she said. Preskey said the land belongs to a Texas-based firm, Energy Transfer Partners, and was purchased from a local rancher for an undisclosed price. According to the AP , the Native Americans claim the land is theirs by way of an, "1851 treaty and they won't leave until the pipeline is stopped." "We never ceded this land," said protester Joye Braun. "The $3.8 billion pipeline, most of which has been completed, crosses through North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. Opponents worry about potential effects on drinking water on the Standing Rock Sioux's reservation and farther downstream on the Missouri River, as well as destruction of cultural artifacts," writes the AP. The disputed ranch is more than 100 years old and was the first one to be inducted into the North Dakota Cowboy Hall of Fame. According to the AP: "It is within a half-mile of a larger encampment on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' land where the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and hundreds of others have gathered in protest. Protesters do not have a federal permit to be on the corps' land, but the agency said it wouldn't evict them due to free speech reasons . Authorities have criticized that decision, saying the site has been a launching point for protests at construction sites in the area." While the announcement by the Morton County Sheriff's office may signal a change in tone and the potential for more relaxed police tactics, it remains to be seen. Late Monday, Standing Rock Sioux chairman Dave Archambault II issued the following statement, calling on the Obama Administration's U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the militant treatment of its peaceful protesters, and asked for an injunction to the pipeline's construction. Archambault wrote; The militarization of local law enforcement and enlistment of multiple law enforcements agencies from neighboring states is needlessly escalating violence and unlawful arrests against peaceful protestors at Standing Rock. We do not condone reports of illegal actions, but believe the majority of peaceful protestors are reacting to strong-arm tactics and abuses by law enforcement. Thousands of water protectors have joined the Tribe in solidarity against DAPL, without incident or serious injury. Yet, North Dakota law enforcement have proceeded with a disproportionate response to their nonviolent exercise of their First Amendment rights, even going as far as labeling them rioters and calling their every action illegal. We are disappointed to see that our state and congressional delegations and Gov. Jack Dalrymple have failed to ensure the safety and rights of the citizens engaged in peaceful protests who were arrested on Saturday. Their lack of leadership and commitment to creating a dialogue towards a peaceful solution reflects not only the unjust historical narrative against Native Americans, but a dangerous trend in law enforcement tactics across America. For these reasons, we believe the situation at Standing Rock deserves the immediate and full attention of the U.S. Department of Justice. Furthermore, the DOJ should impose an injunction to all developments at the pipeline site to keep ALL citizens - law enforcement and protestors - safe. The DOJ should be enlisted and expected to investigate the overwhelming reports and videos demonstrating clear strong-arm tactics, abuses and unlawful arrests by law enforcement. The chairman's request seems to validate many of the reports coming from the field, that peaceful protesters are being labeled as rioters and are not being treated with the dignity they feel they deserve. As The Free Thought Project reported two days ago, many of the protesters are being thrown to the ground, squashed underfoot, strip-searched, and forced to remove sacred hair braids — all considered "strong-arm tactics, abuses, and unlawful," by Archambault.

Date: 2015-12-20 17:26 Subject: Last night Hi John, I wanted to reach out to say thanks for the principled and nuanced stance the Secretary took last night on encryption and the tech sector. Leadership at Apple certainly noticed and I am sure that is true though out the Valley. Please know that Apple will continue its work with law enforcement. We share law enforcement's concerns about the threat to citizens and we work closely with authorities to comply with legal requests for data that have helped solve complex crimes. Thousands of times every month, we give governments information about Apple customers and devices, in response to warrants and other forms of legal process. We have a team that responds to those requests 24 hours a day. Strong encryption does not eliminate Apple's ability to give law enforcement meta-data or any of a number of other very useful categories of data. Tonight, Tim and Apple will be featured on "60 Minutes." We expect encryption and taxes to be covered. In previews, Tim reacts strongly to the EU tax investigation of Apple and other American companies. We will amplify encryption messaging tomorrow when we publicly release our comments on the draft UK Investigatory Powers bill. Best wishes to you and your family and the HRC family for a peaceful and joyous holiday season and a prosperous and bright 2016. Lisa Her comments about handing over data to the government are in marked contrast to the strong pro-customer statement on encryption made by Apple chief executive Tim Cook earlier this year when the FBI demanded that Apple hand over data on an Apple iPhone 5C belonging to one of the two people who participated in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California. Jackson was referring to comments made by Hillary Clinton during the third debate between candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination. The email was released by WikiLeaks which has gained access to a trove of correspondence from Podesta's Gmail account. In that debate , Clinton was asked: "You've talked a lot about bringing tech leaders and government officials together, but Apple CEO Tim Cook said removing encryption tools from our products altogether would only hurt law-abiding citizens who rely on us to protect their data. So would you force him to give law enforcement a key to encrypted technology by making it law?" Her response was: "I would not want to go to that point. I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners." On 2 December 2015, two terrorists shot and killed 14 people and injured 22 others in San Bernardino. Early this year, there was a pitched battle between the FBI and Apple over a demand by the former that data on an iPhone 5C be handed over to law enforcement authorities. The issue went to court and the FBI finally backed down . Jackson wrote, in what appears to be an effort to stay in the Democrats' good books, "Please know that Apple will continue its work with law enforcement. We share law enforcement's concerns about the threat to citizens and we work closely with authorities to comply with legal requests for data that have helped solve complex crimes. " Thousands of times every month, we give governments information about Apple customers and devices, in response to warrants and other forms of legal process. We have a team that responds to those requests 24 hours a day. Strong encryption does not eliminate Apple's ability to give law enforcement meta-data or any of a number of other very useful categories of data."

In previews, Tim reacts strongly to the EU tax investigation of Apple and other American companies. We will amplify encryption messaging tomorrow when we publicly release our comments on the draft UK Investigatory Powers bill." Comment: Here we go again, rampant hypocrisy, this time from Apple. Just like Killary, Apple has a public and a private position. The public position for the gullible sleeping consumer "we care about your privacy, hence our encryption" The other for the government "don't worry we can give you whatever you want." And you would never have known if not for the WikiLeaks emails.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 21:49 UTC © Naif Rahma / Reuters As the death toll in Yemen surpasses 10,000, Saudi Arabia, one of the principal parties in the conflict, is poised to be reelected to the UN human rights body. Saudi airstrikes are responsible for the majority of the nearly 4,000 civilian deaths in Yemen. A secret ballot vote at the UN General Assembly on Friday will select the 14 members of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), or a third of its 47 members. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, China, and Japan are running for the four seats from the Asia-Pacific region, and are all expected to secure seats. Riyadh's term at the UNHRC would be the third in a row, and its presence at the body has been increasingly puzzling to human rights groups, given its record of twisting arms at the UN to hush up its rights abuses. In June, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon publicly admitted that Saudi Arabia threatened to withdraw funding from numerous programs due to an upcoming report on violations of children's rights. The report would list the Arab kingdom among violators over the toll its military campaign and blockade of Yemen has taken on children. The threat resulted in Saudi Arabia's removal from the blacklist, even though Riyadh's tactics had been exposed. "The report describes horrors no child should have to face," Ban Ki-moon told reporters at the time. "At the same time, I also had to consider the very real prospect that millions of other children would suffer grievously if, as was suggested to me, countries would defund many UN programs." "It is unacceptable for UN member states to exert undue pressure," the secretary-general added, pledging to review the removal of the Saudis from the list. This incident of Saudi Arabia working against UN human rights efforts is far from being isolated. In Yemen, the kingdom used control of air traffic to prevent foreign journalists, employees of international aid organizations, and UN officials from visiting the war-torn country and reporting on the situation there. In September, it used diplomatic pressure against the Netherlands after it introduced a resolution at the UNHRC that would launch an independent investigation into airstrikes on Yemen. The Dutch proposal failed and an Arab version was passed, one which entrusted the probe to the exiled Yemeni government, which the Saudis want to put back into power through its military actions. Domestically, Riyadh's policies often run against those of the UN human rights body. Seven petitions to allow special rapporteurs for the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights to investigate abuses in Saudi Arabia remain pending , some for over a decade. The kingdom was also reported to persecute its own subjects who cooperate with UN investigations. For instance, human rights defender Mohammed al-Qahtani, who contributed to several UNHRC reports, was accused of things like "distorting the reputation of the country" and "provoking international organizations to adopt stances against the kingdom." He is currently serving a lengthy prison term. While far from being the only authoritarian regime with a seat at the UNHRC, Saudi Arabia maintains some of the most restrictive domestic policies. Homosexuality and conversion from Islam to another religion are punishable by death. Sentences include corporal punishment, as highlighted by the case of blogger Raif Badawi who is to be flogged 1,000 times while serving a 10-year sentence for "insulting Islam." Saudi Arabia is also one of the world's most enthusiastic executors. The number of beheadings spiked under King Salman with 157 executions reported in 2015, and 124 between January and September 2016. Comment: Once again it seems to be all about the money Saudi Arabia brings to the UN, kind of like 'hush money'.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 03:20 UTC From CARDIFF UNIVERSITY Why does our planet experience an ice age every 100,000 years? Deep storage of carbon dioxide in the oceans may have triggered this unexplained phenomena, new research shows. © Lisieki and Raymo LR04 δ18O from Lisieki and Raymo (2005) correlated to the temperature anomaly inferred from the deuterium concentration in ice cores from EPICA Dome C, Antarctica (Jouzel et al., 2007). The main orbital (purple), tectonic (brown) and oceanic (blue) events are indicated (see the text for the references of each event). The orange box represents the start of the onset of the Northern Hemisphere glaciations. 100 kyrs and 40 kyrs correspond to the orbitally-driven glacial/interglacial cycles period. This period changed from 41 kyrs to 100 kyrs during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition toward 1 Ma (MPT). click to enlarge Experts from Cardiff University have offered up an explanation as to why our planet began to move in and out of ice ages every 100,000 years. This mysterious phenomena, dubbed the '100,000 year problem', has been occurring for the past million years or so and leads to vast ice sheets covering North America, Europe and Asia. Up until now, scientists have been unable to explain why this happens. Our planet's ice ages used to occur at intervals of every 40,000 years, which made sense to scientists as the Earth's seasons vary in a predictable way, with colder summers occurring at these intervals. However there was a point, about a million years ago, called the 'Mid-Pleistocene Transition', in which the ice age intervals changed from every 40,000 years to every 100,000 years. New research published today in the journal Geology has suggested the oceans may be responsible for this change, specifically in the way that they suck carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere. By studying the chemical make-up of tiny fossils on the ocean floor, the team discovered that there was more CO2 stored in the deep ocean during the ice age periods at regular intervals every 100,000 years. This suggests that extra carbon dioxide was being pulled from the atmosphere and into the oceans at this time, subsequently lowering the temperature on Earth and enabling vast ice sheets to engulf the Northern Hemisphere. Lead author of the research Professor Carrie Lear, from the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, said: "We can think of the oceans as inhaling and exhaling carbon dioxide, so when the ice sheets are larger, the oceans have inhaled carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, making the planet colder. When the ice sheets are small, the oceans have exhaled carbon dioxide, so there is more in the atmosphere which makes the planet warmer. "By looking at the fossils of tiny creatures on the ocean floor, we showed that when ice sheets were advancing and retreating every 100,000 years the oceans were inhaling more carbon dioxide in the cold periods, suggesting that there was less left in the atmosphere." Marine algae play a key role in removing CO2 from the atmosphere as it is an essential ingredient of photosynthesis. CO2 is put back into the atmosphere when deep ocean water rises to the surface through a process called upwelling, but when a vast amount of sea ice is present this prevents the CO2 from being exhaled, which could make the ice sheets bigger and prolong the ice age. "If we think of the oceans inhaling and exhaling carbon dioxide, the presence of vast amounts of ice is like a giant gobstopper. It's like a lid on the surface of the ocean," Prof Lear continued. The Earth's climate is currently in a warm spell between glacial periods. The last ice age ended about 11,000 years ago. Since then, temperatures and sea levels have risen, and ice caps have retreated back to the poles. In addition to these natural cycles, manmade carbon emissions are also having an effect by warming the climate.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 03:29 UTC © Chinchilla News A young pygmy elephant walking near her dead mother in Gunung Rara Forest Reserve in Malaysia's sabah state on Borneo Island. The world is hurtling towards the first mass extinction of animal life since the dinosaurs were wiped out 65 million years ago, according to the most comprehensive survey of wildlife ever carried out. By 2020, the populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and other vertebrate species are on course to have fallen by more than two-thirds over a period of just 50 years, the Living Planet report found. The current rate of extinction is about 100 times faster than is considered normal - greater than during some of the previous five mass extinctions in the Earth's history. While the dinosaurs probably died out because a giant meteor hit the planet, just one species is the cause of the current problems: humans. This is one of the reasons why geologists are close to declaring a new epoch, called the Anthropocene after the Greek for human, because the fossils of so many extinct animals will one day form a noticeable, global band in the rocks of the future. The Living Planet report , produced by conservation charity WWF and the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), analysed data for 3,706 species in what was described as the most comprehensive study of the state of wildlife globally. They found that between 1970 and 2012, the average decline in population was 58 per cent. And at the current rate this figure will hit 67 per cent by 2020, the year by which the world has pledged to halt the loss of wildlife. Dr Mike Barrett, director of science and policy at WWF-UK, said: "For the first time since the demise of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, we face a global mass extinction of wildlife. "We ignore the decline of other species at our peril - for they are the barometer that reveals our impact on the world that sustains us. "Humanity's misuse of natural resources is threatening habitats, pushing irreplaceable species to the brink and threatening the stability of our climate." Some of the most iconic animals are under severe pressure for multiple different reasons with one common factor. For example, poachers have slaughtered vast numbers of African elephants with the population falling by 111,000 to 415,000 in only a decade. The giant anteater and maned wolf are under threat because the grasslands where they live in Brazil are being converted into soy fields and pasture for cattle. Chemical pollution is affecting marine life from orcas to polar bears. PCBs used in paints, pesticides and flame retardants have been linked to cancer and weakening the polar bears' penis bone to the point they can snap. And numbers of Himalayan griffons have plummeted because of a drug given to cattle which gives the majestic birds kidney failure after they eat the meat of dead animals. But Dr Barrett stressed the situation was far from hopeless. "We know how to stop this. It requires governments, businesses and citizens to rethink how we produce, consume, measure success and value the natural environment," Dr Barrett said. The UK, he added, needed a "serious plan" to increase protection for species and habitats. But it should also take steps to reduce its "global footprint" on wildlife around the world. Professor Ken Norris, ZSL's science director, said the report should spur people into action. "Human behaviour continues to drive the decline of wildlife populations globally, with particular impact on freshwater habitats," he said. "Importantly, however, these are declines - they are not yet extinctions - and this should be a wake-up call to marshal efforts to promote the recovery of these populations." Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom has repeatedly said the Government wants this generation to be the first to leave the environment in a better state than it found it. And she said: "The Living Planet Report is a stark reminder of the scale of the challenge we face, but it also makes clear that the solutions are there if we all play our part. "The UK has a strong track record in wildlife conservation and I am committed to protecting and restoring our natural environment for future generations." Ms Leadsom added the Government planned to create a "Blue Belt of protection" around British Overseas Territories which were "home to unique marine species and habitats, which, without protection, could be lost forever".

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 17:26 UTC © Sandro Perozzi/AP The Church of San Sebastiano stands amid rubble in Castelsantangelo sul Nera following an earthquake. A 6.0 magnitude earthquake hit the Marche region in central Italy, just hours after a 5.4-magnitude tremor damaged buildings and cut power lines across the area. Buildings in the region have been damaged, but there have been no reports of fatalities. A series of powerful aftershocks between magnitude 4 and 4.9 struck the area about five hours after the first tremor. The strongest earthquake occurred 9.18 p.m. on Wednesday, 71 km (44 miles) east of Perugia. The United States Geological Survey reported it as a 6.0 magnitude temblor, while Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology said it was a 5.9. "It was a very strong, apocalyptic earthquake - people were screaming in the street, and now the lights are cut off," said Marco Rinaldi, the mayor of Ussita, a community of 400 that was also affected by the initial earthquake. "Many houses have collapsed. Our area is devastated." Trains were stopped for checks, while police closed off some roads in danger of potential landslides. A football match was briefly suspended. Impact was felt as far away as Naples, Rome and Florence. In the capital, historical monuments were shaking from the shockwaves. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has returned from a trip inside the country to chair an emergency meeting in Rome, and has canceled a planned TV appearance. The first earthquake was detected at 7:11pm local time, about 66km to the southeast of Perugia, striking a mountainous part of the Marche region and lasting several seconds. The exact epicenter of the tremblor remains unclear, but it was relatively shallow, at about 9km below ground. Within an hour of the first earthquake, there was a series of small but noticeable aftershocks, ranging in magnitude from 2.5 to 2.8. After the second there were at least four after shocks exceeding 3 on the Richter scale. "We're in the square, all the lights are out, we can't see, we're counting each other to see who's here, we still don't know how bad the situation is," Mauro Falcucci, mayor of Castelsantangelo sul Nera, the small commune closest to the epicenter, told Sky News by phone. "The situation is delicate. It is important to remain calm." The official said that the emergency is exacerbated by a downpour, and intermittent problems with mobile phone communication. Police say that the town is in "crisis" and have dispatched rescue teams, Castelsantangelo sul Nera. A video posted by a Huffington Post journalist shows rubble strewn through the streets of Visso, a commune less than 10 km from the epicenter. The Civil Protection Agency, which has been overseeing the response, says that so far only two injuries have been identified, in Visso. The first, smaller earthquake, may have served as a warning, as people were in open areas, and prepared, when the second temblor struck. Schools will be shut in some cities throughout eastern and central Italy on Thursday, and in Ascoli, local media is reporting that hundreds of people are gathering in public squares, and sleeping outside in cars. The earthquakes are in the same area of seismic instability in the Apennines as the one that struck the village of Amatrice this summer, killing almost 300 people. The strongest earthquake there was 6.2-magnitude on August 24. Seismologists now fear a multiplier effect from the increased disruption resulting from the twin natural disasters. "The earthquake today has further disrupted the tectonic plates, and in the coming hours we may see aftershocks of today's earthquake on top of those from August 24," Salvatore Mazza, the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology told RAI News24. "This earthquake is likely the activation of a new fault line, connected to August's calamity . But we need to get closer to the epicenter, before drawing conclusions," said Paulo Messina, for the Institute of Environmental Geology and Geoengineering of the Italian National Research Council.

A landslide on the main highway linking Colombia's two biggest cities has killed at least six people and trapped an unknown number under tons of earth. Antioquia state rescue chief Mario Parodi says four people were rescued and hospitalized after the Wednesday morning disaster covered all four lanes of the highway linking Bogota with Medellin. Rescuers with dogs joined the search for victims. Parodi said two motorcycles, a truck and two small vehicles were buried by the slide, which covered two football fields. He said the highway would be closed for several days. Landslides are not uncommon in Colombia's rugged mountainous terrain. Source: Associated Press

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 08:27 UTC Aleppo destruction Russia's ambassador to the United Nations has criticized UN's failure to properly organize humanitarian evacuations of the wounded from terrorist-held areas of Aleppo. The UN envoy to Syria defended the team, pinning the blame on the warring parties. "We regret to note that the United Nations has not properly worked out an operation to evacuate the sick and the wounded," Vitaly Churkin noted at the UN Security Council session, according to RIA. The ambassador added that the UN work with various opposition groups in Aleppo and the local council was "left to take care of itself." He stressed that the UN personnel did not "exert the necessary pressure" on "sponsors" of illegal armed groups to convince them to cooperate with the aid workers on the ground. Besides criticizing the UN team, the Russian envoy also accused entities that have influence over fighters in besieged neighborhoods of Aleppo of not applying enough pressure on the militants to make the most of the Russian-Syrian humanitarian pause. "External patrons of entrenched groups in eastern Aleppo could not or did not want positively influence the fighters and convince them to stop the shooting, to release civilians or leave the city themselves," Churkin said. The ambassador noted that militants in Aleppo continue to get supplies and arms, including portable surface-to-air shoulder launchers (MANPADs) and missiles. The humanitarian pause was introduced in Aleppo on October 20, as Syrian and Russian jets halted all strikes in the vicinity of the city. While only an estimated ten percent of the city's populace live in terrorist-held Eastern Aleppo, Moscow is doing everything possible to secure the evacuation of civilians. Those civilians who want to leave jihadist-held areas may use six humanitarian corridors. Fighters can also leave the city with their weapons by using two other corridors established by the Russians and the Syrians. However, terrorists have refused to leave and instead resorted to shelling the civilian escape routes. Russian and Syrian planes have stayed out of the city for eight consecutive days. In that time, only a few dozen civilians managed to escape the terrorist-held areas. Meanwhile, the Russian reconciliation centers continued to pour aid into Aleppo. During the Security Council session, the UN official in charge of humanitarian aid defended the world organization's actions in Syria, laying blame at both the rebels, Damascus, and Moscow for not allowing the UN humanitarian assistance to take place. "The United Nations were ready to launch our operations on Sunday, 23 October. However, objections by two non-State armed opposition groups, namely Ahrar as-Sham and Nureddin Zenki, scuppered these plans. The United Nations made every effort to get assurances from all parties, only for the parties to then fail to agree on each other's conditions about how evacuations should proceed," said Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Stepen O'Brien. In the meantime, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent teams working in Aleppo have complained that delivering the humanitarian aid and treating the wounded has been a challenge, as the ICRC failed to "secure the security guarantees of some armed groups." Back at the UNSC, O'Brien painted a clear picture for the members of the UN Security Council of human suffering in Eastern Aleppo where terrorists use civilians as human shields. In a graphic yet poetic account, O'Brien said that civilians - mostly children and elderly - are stuck in basements where "the stench of urine and the vomit caused by unrelieved fear never leaving your nostrils" is omnipresent. "Or scrabbling with your bare hands in the street above to reach under concrete rubble, lethal steel reinforcing bars jutting at you as you hysterically try to reach your young child screaming unseen in the dust and dirt below your feet, you choking to catch your breath in the toxic dust and the smell of gas ever-ready to ignite and explode over you." "These are constant, harrowing reports and images of people detained, tortured, forcibly displaced, maimed and executed," O'Brien added. While mentioning the destructive role of terrorist on the ground, the UN envoy to Syria went out of his way to blame Damascus and Moscow for their air raids. "Aleppo has essentially become a kill zone. Since my last report to this Council less than a month ago, 400 more people have been killed and nearly 2,000 injured in eastern Aleppo. So many of them - too many of them - were children," O'Brien said. "Never has the phrase by poet Robert Burns, of 'Man's inhumanity to man' been as apt. It can be stopped but you the Security Council have to choose to make it stop," the envoy added. Taking the mic at the UNSC meeting, Churkin criticized O'Brien's report, which he said lacked factual information and failed to stress the cessation of Syrian and Russian air raids on the city. He asked O'Brian not to recite poetry but base his reports on concrete facts. "If we wanted to hear a sermon, we would go to church. If we wanted to hear poetry, we would go to a theater," Churkin said. Security Council members wanted to hear "objective analysis" of the situation on the ground from O'Brien, the Russian ambassador stressed. "You clearly did not achieve this," Churkin said, reminding O'Brien that no strikes have been conducted over Aleppo since October 18. Calling O'Brian's statement "provocative and unacceptable," Churkin pointed that in the past eight days Syrian and Russian planes had not flown over Aleppo, staying at least 10 km away from the city. "This moratorium on the flight lasted eight days [now]. Mr. O 'Brian, you did not mention a single word about it. You have built your speech so to paint a picture that aerial bombardment did not stop for one day and that it is happening now, as we speak," said Churkin. US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power also criticized the Russian humanitarian corridors in Aleppo. "Russia made an announcement about 6 humanitarian corridors and urged to take these corridors, including people with arms. But those families were terrified about entrusting their fates to the people who have been bombing their neighborhoods," she said. Churkin replied that Power resorted to her usual tactics - "distorting the Russian stance to the point of absurdity." "It is terrifying to live here [in Aleppo]. And the US is asking: 'What can we do?' We told you what to do - to have both Russian and American military work together on Castello road [in Aleppo]. You said no!" Churkin said. Power and the US delegation, along with the UK, French, and Ukrainian delegations, later staged a walkout as Churkin passed the floor to the Syrian representative.

Mon, 24 Oct 2016 08:13 UTC © Nutrition Review Mold toxin in cereals, coffee and wine inhibits cell regeneration in the brain. Chronic sinus problems, brain fog, unrelenting fatigue, ice pick headaches, increased gut permeability, and prone to static shocks may be signs of trouble with mold allergies and mold toxins. Sources of molds can easily come from fall foliage decay, water damage from heavy rains, floods, and hurricanes, and even several foods. Exposure to mold leads to not only the common respiratory symptoms, but can cause increased gut permeability and more severe immune disorders like CIRS and Mold-Related Illness. Mold toxins are ubiquitous and must be managed for health. Mold Allergies Mayo Clinic describes mold allergy as similar to other types of upper respiratory allergies. Common symptoms include sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, cough and postnasal drip, itchy eyes, nose and throat, watery eyes, and dry, scaly skin. Mold allergy problems may lead to asthma, fungal sinus infections, and allergic reactions in the lung like allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In this context, the mold allergies recognized are IgE reactions. IgE reactions reflect immunological inflammation caused by immediate or acute hypersensitivity. This is the same response as someone who eats peanuts or strawberries and develops hives or has anaphylactic symptoms. Treatment focuses on nasal corticosteroids like Flonase and Omnaris along with antihistamines. Natural support for acute allergic mold symptoms focus on antihistamines, reducing congestion, and blocking immune system chemicals like leukotrienes that lead to excess mucus. A number of antihistamine drugs are modeled after the nutrient quercetin, a natural antihistamine and bioflavonoid found in apples, onions, and other natural foods. Carnosine, chlorella, arabinogalactan, B vitamins, vitamin C, D, tocotrienols and DHA help reduce histamine release, help stabilize the immune (mast) cells that release histamine, and help lymphatic congestion. Antihistamine medications are not without side effects. Benadryl affects acetylcholine and may increase the risk for dementia. Mold Toxins In addition to mold allergies, there is the concern of mold toxins impacting the health of the gut and immune system. Changes in childhood growth, increased gut permeability, autoimmune disorders, and even systemic autoimmune inflammatory reactions, known as Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) may occur as a result of mold biotoxins or mycotoxins. Mold emits toxins that the body must detoxify. These substances, known as volatile organic compounds or VOCs, produce the musty odor of mold. Some of the gases produced include hexane, benzene, acetone and methylene chloride. These gases are known for their role in upper respiratory inflammation and sick building syndrome. Another toxic substance produced by mold is trichothecenes. Trichothecenes are toxic metabolites or mycotoxins produced by mold or fungus. They are found in the agricultural and food industry worldwide, which poses health hazards for animals and humans alike. Trichothecenes decrease macrophage activity in the immune system, which may increase the susceptibility to bacteria and viruses. Macrophages are a type of white blood cell that helps clean up cellular debris, germs, cancer cells, etc. It is the pac-man garbage collector of the immune system. Mold Toxins and Gut Changes Foods contaminated with molds are of concern around the globe. Mycotoxins , like aflatoxin, deoxinivalenol (DON), and fumonisins, etc. effect the intestines and cause significant damage to the gut lining and function. The direct impact includes decreased intestinal cell viability, reductions in short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations elimination of beneficial bacteria, increased expression of genes involved in promoting inflammation and counteracting oxidative stress. Researchers report that as technology is able to better measure food contamination to mold toxins, they find "that a significant proportion of the human population is chronically exposed to DON doses exceeding the provisional maximum tolerable daily dose." Recent research demonstrates just how powerful these mold biotoxins are, affecting intestinal function but also damaging immune, endocrine, and neurological function, and stunting the growth process in children . Animal and human studies focus on three major mycotoxins - aflatoxin (AF), fumonisin (FUM), and deoxynivaenol (DON). These different toxins have distinct actions, but they all cause intestinal damage, affect protein synthesis and create inflammation. As a result of consuming foods contaminated with mycotoxins, children in this study experienced environmental enteropathy. This is a low grade chronic condition of the small intestine that causes poor absorption of nutrients and increased intestinal permeability (Leaky Gut Syndrome). The mycotoxin contaminated food causes a breakdown in the villi or fingerlike projections of the gut resulting in inflammation affecting the entire body. Researchers believe that the chronic exposure to mycotoxins in the food supply contributed significantly to loss of growth, wasting, and stunting in these children. This concern is widely present in third world countries, but it certainly raises questions for all, even in affluent countries. Common Mold Toxins in Foods Aflatoxins may be present in many different types of foods. This includes cereals, tree nuts, corn, peanuts/peanut butter, pistachios, Brazil nuts, chilies, black pepper, dried fruit and figs. Milk, cheese, and dairy products may be contaminated with aflatoxins. Fumonisins are primarily found in corn-based products like yellow cornmeal, blue cornmeal, corn muffin mix, and mixed grain cereals. The mold mycotoxin DON (deoxynivaenol) is frequently found infecting grains in the field or during storage . Humans are exposed to it with the consumption of cereal grains like corn, wheat, oats, barley, and rice. Researchers note that it has been detected in buckwheat, popcorn, sorghum, triticale, and other food products including flour, bread, breakfast cereals, noodles, infant foods, pancakes, malt and beer. Pointing out these foods is not meant to make one "food phobic" but rather it is to realize that these toxins are ubiquitous and they can be problematic especially if they are a staple to the diet. Certain foods will have more or less amounts than others. Individuals who struggle with mold toxins, leaky gut syndrome, and insufficient antioxidants may need to limit or avoid these foods while their body heals. CIRS - Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Mold biotoxins can have a severe impact on health in those who are genetically susceptible. These biotoxins commonly occur in the environment from water damaged buildings and as noted above from the food supply, etc. Once the source of mold toxins has been removed and the damaged structure repaired, many individuals are able to clear these mold toxins out of the body without trouble. However, it is estimated that almost 25 percent of the population is genetically susceptible to chronic mold illness, which is known as Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome or CIRS. An older name is "mixed mold exposure" . CIRS occurs because of genetic susceptibility with the HLA DR/DQ genes. Individuals who have this gene and the protein (MHC Class II protein) that it commands, fail to recognize mold toxins or biotoxins. The mold biotoxins stay activated in the body and continue to cause inflammation and damage. Until the toxins are cleared out, the chronic inflammation stays smoldering . The same genes also affect how the MHCII proteins recognize Lyme biotoxins. Lab Tests for Severe or Unresolved Concerns If you wonder why you can't get rid of chronic respiratory concerns, ongoing fatigue, and feel like your losing your memory, you may want to look into testing for the HLA DR/DQ (DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, DRB5 and DQ) mold susceptibility genes. Other labs of great value include TGF-beta, MSH, VEGF, VIP, C4a, C3a, anti-gliadin (gluten) intolerance, ADH, MMP-9, and leptin. Estrogen, progesterone, thyroid and adrenal hormones are also affected by mold toxins leading to deficient or imbalanced levels. Common lab tests that measure inflammation, i.e. CRP and SED rate, are not elevated with mold biotoxins. What Does CIRS Look Like? Symptoms or common diagnoses associated with or affected by CIRS and mold toxins includes Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, ulcerative colitis , fibromyalgia, Lyme disease , Hashimoto's thyroiditis, chronic EBV and other herpes viruses, rheumatoid arthritis , brain fog, brain fatigue , Crohn's disease, Celiac disease, poor memory, exercise intolerance, respiratory problems, chronic sinusitis, blood sugar problems, and poor oxygenation . Fatigue, muscle aches, muscle cramps, ice pick headaches/sharp stabbing pain in the head, light sensitivity, morning stiffness, word finding difficulties, decreased academic or work performance, frequent or increased static shocks, appetite changes, vertigo, body temperature dysregulation, diarrhea, and other symptoms may be present. Autoimmune disorders and neurological inflammation should raise the question of mold toxicity. Sudden increase in weight after moving into water damaged building or new work environment may occur due to the inflammatory overload to the brain that leads to leptin resistance . Elevated leptin and weight gain in this context will fail to respond to dietary changes and physical activity. Removal of oneself from the toxic environment is critical followed by mold remediation of the building. Removal of dust particles saturated with mold VOCs is important as these circulate through the air and will continue to affect the mold toxin susceptible individual. Work with mold experts if you suspect or have CIRS and live or work in a water damaged building. How to Help Ease the Toxic Burden One of the most important things that you can do to help your body, i.e. your liver, gut, brain deal with these toxins is to ensure healthy glutathione levels, detoxification and removal of these substances from the body, and gut repair . Support and treatment of mold toxins includes several different nutrients. Mold toxins must be detoxified through the liver and the cytochrome P450 pathway. This detox system relies heavily on adequate glutathione and SOD enzymatic antioxidant pathways which require several nutrients. This includes B vitamins, NAC, MSM sulfur, acetyl-l-carnitine, lipoic acid, taurine, choline, glycine, glutamine, arginine, manganese, iron, coenzyme Q10, zinc, copper, silymarin, omega 3 fish oils, vitamin A, C, and E, and others. It is also helpful to support healthy gall bladder and bile acid function to help bind onto and clear mold toxins. Friendly flora/gut bacteria, fiber , lipoic acid, oregano oil , chlorella , or d-limonene help support this process. By supporting glutathione, cytochrome P 450 system, bile acids and gall bladder, the body stands a better chance in clearing out the VOCs and inflammatory compounds that mold exposure creates. Rebuilding and healing of the damaged gut lining is just as essential as the detoxification of mold toxins to stop autoimmune, endocrine, and neurological injury. Leaky Gut Syndrome repair relies heavily on vitamin D, vitamin A, glutamine, omega 3 oils, the good omega-6 oil GLA, and probiotics. Curcumin, boswellia, and resveratrol provide vital anti-inflammatory support for the gut and also the brain. Use enough digestive enzyme support to help breakdown all food types and reduce the strain on the gut and immune system. For those who have CIRS, other steps and medical support may be needed. Mold toxins are invariably present. It is a matter of how we handle their toxic effects or if we struggle under the burden of this environmental challenge. Genetics, exposure amounts, and efficiency and efficacy of the detoxification pathways determine the outcome of this equation. If you feel worse in certain environments or by consuming foods with these toxins, then it may be time to remediate the damaging effects of mold. Nutritional Options Chlorella - This blue-green algae super food packs power when it comes to detoxification. Chlorella binds onto toxins in a safe manner without stressing the liver, gut, or gall bladder. Quality of chlorella varies in the industry. Choose only chlorella grown indoors that is free of environmental toxins. A very thin or semi-permeable cell membrane is preferred over a broken cell membrane. B Vitamins - B vitamins are essential for detoxification and the cytochrome P 450 system. Several of the B vitamins are required for glutathione production and antioxidant function. Given the demands of today's world, B vitamin replenishment and support is a must. Omega-3 and -6 oils - The omega-3 oil DHA and the omega-6 oil GLA are critical in protecting the brain and body from inflammation. The gut lining requires DHA and GLA to heal when increased permeability exists. Vitamin A - This often overlooked vitamin is essential for the epithelial lining of the gut as well as the mucosal lining of the sinuses and lungs. Without adequate vitamin A, the immune system struggles to maintain integrity. Those who struggle with thyroid concerns may not be able to convert beta carotene into vitamin A. Oregano Oil - This spice provides powerful anti-fungal support. It also demonstrates anti-inflammatory and antihistamine benefits. We have used oregano oil for many chronic sinus and respiratory concerns for nearly 25 years with great results. Many low quality forms of oregano oil add olive, soy, or other oils. It is best to use a product free of added, unnecessary ingredients. Silymarin - Silymarin is the active ingredient of milk thistle extract. It has been shown highly protective to the liver and is essential for the cytochrome P 450 system. In addition to its benefits for detoxification, it helps to recycle glutathione and acts a natural anti-inflammatory compound for the liver and brain. Fiber - Fiber is critical to binding onto toxins dumped into the gut. This includes the toxins from the liver and gall bladder. Arabinogalactan fiber and oat bran fiber provide excellent forms of soluble and insoluble fibers. In order to clear toxins and keep the bowels moving, it is often very helpful to increase fiber intake to 30 - 50 grams of fiber per day. Today's diets often have very low fiber intakes of 8-10 grams per day.

 44 UTC © Ronen Zvulun/Reuters Israel presented an ancient fragment of text in Hebrew referencing Jerusalem and recalled its ambassador to UNESCO in a gesture of protest against a resolution which criticized Israel for restricting Muslims' access to a holy site in the city. The text, written on a 11cm by 2.5cm papyrus, was dated by the Israel Antiquities Authority to the 7th century BCE and was said to be the earliest Hebrew reference to Jerusalem outside of the Bible. "From the king's maidservant, from Na'arat, jars of wine, to Jerusalem," read the two lines of script. Archeologists believe it to be document detailing payment of taxes or transfer of goods. "Hey UNESCO, an ancient papyrus dating to the 1st Temple 2700 yrs ago has been found. It bears the oldest known mention of Jerusalem in Hebrew," Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wrote on Twitter. The official's jab was directed at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which earlier on Wednesday passed a controversial resolution criticizing Israel for its handling of the holy site in Jerusalem called Temple Mount by Jews and Haram al-Sharif by Muslims. The resolution was adopted after heated debate over its wording, and particularly the Arabic names used in the document. Israel accused UNESCO and its Arab members of trying to undermine Jewish connections to the holy site. In response to the move, Israel also recalled its ambassador to UNESCO for consultations, while Netanyahu called the situation a "theatre of the absurd." "We'll decide what to do, what our next steps will be," toward the organization, the Israeli PM added. Temple Mount is administered by the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, a religious institution under the auspices of the Jordanian crown, which is responsible for managing rights of visitation and worship, management and repairs under the so-called Status Quo agreement. Israel has controlled East Jerusalem since 1967 and officially annexed it in 1980, though the move has not been recognized by the international community. Israeli authorities have been increasing security in the area recently, occasionally blocking access to the Al-Aqsa mosque and sparking outrage among the Muslim worshipers. The conflict over the holy site and the perception that Israel was trying to change the status quo is seen as a major factor in the latest spree of knife violence by Arabs against Jews. Although the UNESCO resolution removed multiple references to Israel's "occupation" of east Jerusalem and the Old City from the original draft, the softened text did not address all of Israel's complaints. The conflict is aggravated by the fact that many Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be capital of their national state, while Israel considers the entire city its own capital.

 38 UTC © Denis Balibouse / Reuters The NGOs that demanded Russia's removal from UN Human Rights Council lack impartiality as they ignore terrorist activities as well as violations by the US-led coalition in Syria, the Russian Foreign Ministry's Commissioner for Human Rights told RT. Targeting Russia was "a gross misstep on the part of the human rights defenders," Konstantin Dolgov said. "If they call themselves [human rights defenders] they have to be objective. Al least, they have to try to be impartial. How can they assess the human rights situation in Syria in this one-sided manner? Just to join the chorus of Western governments and politicians, groundlessly accusing Russia of bombing civilian targets in Syria, without providing any evidence of this," Dolgov added. The NGOs, which failed to provide any solid proof of Russia's alleged wrongdoings, "completely ignore the bulk of the problem" in Syria, the commissioner stressed. "And the bulk of the problem is the activities of the terrorist organizations like Islamic State, [Jabhat] al-Nusra... which have been persistently killing dozens of thousands of civilians in Syria." Dolgov wondered "how can those NGOs ignore... numerous killings of civilians and destruction of infrastructure by the coalition led by the US?" when "there are multiple examples" of such violations. "If you're against violations of human rights, you should be against violation everywhere and by everybody," he said. The commissioner pointed out that, on Wednesday, Amnesty International - which had not signed the petition - blamed the US for killing hundreds of civilians in Syria and refusing to investigate those incidents. The numbers of civilian victims provided by the group - around 300 - "aren't complete," Dolgov said. "I don't think that an accurate number. I don't think anybody there has an accurate number." More than 80 international organizations - including Human Rights Watch, CARE International and Refugees International - have signed a petition for Russia to be thrown off the UN Human Rights Council. They claimed that Moscow was no longer fit to hold its position in the United Nations body, due to its military operation in Syria. It turned out that most of the organizations are part of the very same Syria Relief Network based in Turkey, however, casting potential doubts over their impartiality. The petition came ahead of the UN Human Rights Council election, scheduled to take place on Friday. The Foreign Ministry official opted not to predict the outcome of the vote, but said that Russia was "definitely" running to regain its seat on the council. "We're running because we have a very strong record in the protection of international law; in the protection of international human rights law. We don't have right now, at this last moment before the election, to prove anything. Our policies are well known and we've been one of the most active and creative members of the UN Human Rights Council for many-many years now," Dolgov stressed. Moscow is aware that there some international players who want to block Russia's activities in the Human Rights Council, because "we're not professing double standards. We are consistently against politicizing human rights. We have a lot of supporters," Dolgov added.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 09:10 UTC A new large study presented at the American Neurological Association Annual Meeting has found a strong connection between cholesterol-lowering medications and Parkinson's disease. Contradicting previous claims that statins are protective against PD. In recent years there has been a considerable effort to try to find new applications for statins. Reports have tried to link statins with positive results on a wide range of conditions, such as: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Cancer, Multiple Sclerosis and Depression. These claims have been somewhat surprising considering that the brain and nervous system have the highest requirements for cholesterol and low cholesterol levels are associated with cognition problems, increased suicide, and an increased risk for some types of cancer . Many people have suspected that the data is being carefully cherry picked in an attempt to show a false benefit and expand the use of statins into other areas. In the new study, researchers analysed data from the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database - including information on 30,343,035 persons aged 40 to 65 years. The use of cholesterol-lowering drugs was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of Parkinson's disease. This is not the first time that we have seen an absence of the predicted benefits of statins in real life data. For example, a large study in 2011 collected data from 289 of 290 municipalities in Sweden and found that the predicted benefits of statins had not materialised, despite a dramatic increase in statin use. An important finding of this new study is that all of the cholesterol lowering drugs included were associated with an increased risk of PD. Suggesting that the harms of the drugs could be directly related to the cholesterol-lowering effect. This adds to the mountain of data that now exists to show that having a low level of cholesterol is worse than having a high level. Sources Nilsson, S et al. No connection between the level of exposition to statins in the population and the incidence/ mortality of acute myocardial infarction: An ecological study based on Sweden's municipalities.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 08:47 UTC © Francois Lenoir/Reuters Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel German Chancellor Angela Merkel launched a broadside at internet media giants, accusing them of "narrowing perspective," and demanding they disclose their privately-developed algorithms. Merkel previously blamed social media for anti-immigrant sentiment and the rise of the far right. Comment: Obviously it has nothing to do with your immigration policy. Only right wing racists would ever have a problem with that. Right comrades? "The algorithms must be made public, so that one can inform oneself as an interested citizen on questions like: what influences my behavior on the internet and that of others? " said Merkel during a media conference in Berlin on Tuesday. Comment: What we have here is a confluence of stupid. Take a politician who doesn't understand technology, give them a microphone, and listen as they embarrass themselves with hyperbolic pronouncements and decrees. "These algorithms, when they are not transparen t, can lead to a distortion of our perception, they narrow our breadth of information. " Google uses an algorithm to decide which search results are first shown to a user, while Facebook arranges the order of the news feed, and decides to include certain posts from a user's liked pages and friends, at the expense of others. Both sites also promote links to news articles, often based on a user's own media interests . These algorithms are at the core of the intellectual property of any social media or search website, and comprise some of the most highly-protected trade secrets in the world, potentially worth billions. No internet giant has ever revealed its inner workings. Merkel did not specifically name Facebook, Google or Twitter, but implied that the large platforms are creating "bubbles" of self-reinforcing views, and squeezing out smaller news providers. Comment: Hypocrite says what? The rule with politicians is: ALWAYS INVERT. What Merkel means to say is that: large platforms allow people to get a more concise summary of news from smaller providers, which is squeezing out the larger state propaganda news agencies. "The big internet platforms, via their algorithms, have become an eye of a needle which diverse media must pass through to reach users ," warned Merkel. "This is a development that we need to pay careful attention to." Comment: See what we mean. What she is saying here is: "People shouldn't be able to choose what they want to read, we should make sure that what they read is what we (the state) wants them to read. " Can't have all willy-nilly preference reading, now can we. The internet giants themselves have argued that the so-called social media bubble is largely a myth, and that online users have a wider access to differing views than under a pre-internet model, where most news would be acquired from just a handful of newspapers and one or two TV channels. German establishment raises 'Sword of Damocles' over social media   attack on social media by Merkel and her Grand Coalition government , and while the German politician advocates diversity of views, she has previously accused it of perpetrating opinions t hat are most at odds with those of the establishment and traditional media . Comment: Her agenda is showing. Last month, Merkel accused AfD, the recently-established anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim party, which receives overwhelmingly negative coverage in most newspapers, of "spreading their lies" through social media, as it achieves breakthroughs in regional elections around the country. Comment: Couldn't be because of popular support? What functioning brain buys this horsehockey? This is the same kind of thinking that leads tot he belief in magical spells. What, these "right-wing" parties have learned the 14 words to magically turn anyone into a racist? A year ago, at the height of the refugee influx into the country, Merkel, who was first elected in 2005, was caught on a hot mic personally pressing Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to clamp down on anti-migrant posts during a UN session in New York. A fortnight ago, the leader of Merkel's parliamentary CDU faction, Volker Kauder, said that social media should be fined €50,000 for failing to remove "hate speech," saying that a "Sword of Damocles" has to hang over social media. Kauder also called for warnings, similar to those on cigarette packs or before entering pornographic websites, to be given to those about to go on social media. Justice Minister Heiko Maas - who said that there had been a 77 percent increase in hate crimes following the arrival of 900,000 asylum seekers - has given internet media companies until February next year to comply with EU directives on xenophobia and racism , or face legal action. Comment: You see the language game? Immigrant = asylum seeker = refugee. But those words are not the same, they are all different things. Xenophobia is the fear of foreigners, and racism is the belief that certain ethnicities have inescapable inherent traits. These words are not cognates, nor are they even within the same semantic continuum. They are bombarding you with a bunch of negative words hoping they'll stick. Why? What do they want you to think? And do you really want to think it?

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 03:59 UTC © Robyn Beck / AFP Despite officers threatening to clear private land, Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) protesters are refusing to leave. As tensions have built up, police handling of the protest has reportedly cost nearly $6 million in just one month. "We have the resources. We could go down there at any time and we are trying everything we can to not have to do that,"Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney told reporters on Wednesday. Protesters have been occupying private land known as Cannonball Ranch, which belongs to the Dakota Access Pipeline's developer, the Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners. Since the weekend, both the company and law enforcement have been asking dozens of protesters to leave the area and move to public land. The occupation began Sunday, when demonstrators set up a new camp of at least 15 tents and 100 teepees. They have also blocked State Highway 1806, putting themselves directly in the path of the planned 1,172-mile pipeline, which will span four states. "Just come off the private property, go back to the big camp and let's talk and try figure out the solution for this. Their message was absolutely not, we are standing here," Laney said, adding that "at some point rule of law has to be enforced." Energy Transfer Partners also said in a statement that "all trespassers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and removed from the land." More than 125 people were arrested over the weekend, but the message had no effect on the protest. Demonstrators have refused to vacate the land or leave State Highway 1806, keeping traffic and local residents from using the road. Dozens of protesters formed a human blockade, enforced with horses and hay bales. "No surrender, no retreat!" protest organizer Mekasi Camp-Horinek, of Oklahoma, reportedly yelled to the people as he left negotiations. "We've got to make our bodies a living sacrifice," John Perko, a protester from South Dakota told The Bismarck Tribune. "This is the most honorable thing I could be doing right now." Last week, the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which has been leading the protest since August, agreed to provide its land to relocate the unauthorized camp from the US Army Corps of Engineers property for the winter. As police try to abstain from using force, even the peaceful handling of the protests appears to be draining the budget at high speeds. According to the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services, authorities have spent $5.8 million since early September. This is nearly all of the $6 million the state borrowed from the Bank of North Dakota in emergency funds to deal with the protest against the $3.78 billion pipeline. Meanwhile, an investigation into a September 3 confrontation between protesters and private security guards has revealed license violations. It says that officers who deployed dogs on protesters were not properly licensed and could face criminal charges.

Mon, 24 Oct 2016 10:26 UTC © Sophie Wolfson 'Music probably does something unique. It stimulates the brain in a very powerful way, because of our emotional connection with it.' The multimillion dollar brain training industry is under attack. In October 2014, a group of over 100 eminent neuroscientists and psychologists wrote an open letter warning that "claims promoting brain games are frequently exaggerated and at times misleading". Earlier this year, industry giant Lumosity was fined $2m, and ordered to refund thousands of customers who were duped by false claims that the company's products improve general mental abilities and slow the progression of age-related decline in mental abilities. And a recent review examining studies purporting to show the benefits of such products found "little evidence ... that training improves improves everyday cognitive performance". While brain training games and apps may not live up to their hype, it is well established that certain other activities and lifestyle choices can have neurological benefits that promote overall brain health and may help to keep the mind sharp as we get older. One of these is musical training. Research shows that learning to play a musical instrument is beneficial for children and adults alike, and may even be helpful to patients recovering from brain injuries. "Music probably does something unique," explains neuropsychologist Catherine Loveday of the University of Westminster. "It stimulates the brain in a very powerful way, because of our emotional connection with it." Playing a musical instrument is a rich and complex experience that involves integrating information from the senses of vision, hearing, and touch, as well as fine movements, and learning to do so can induce long-lasting changes in the brain. Professional musicians are highly skilled performers who spend years training, and they provide a natural laboratory in which neuroscientists can study how such changes - referred to as experience-dependent plasticity - occur across their lifespan. Changes in brain structure Early brain scanning studies revealed significant differences in brain structure between musicians and non-musicians of the same age. For example, the corpus callosum, a massive bundle of nerve fibers connecting the two sides of the brain, is significantly larger in musicians. The brain areas involved in movement, hearing, and visuo-spatial abilities also appear to be larger in professional keyboard players. And, the area devoted to processing touch sensations from the left hand is increased in violinists. These studies compared data from different groups of people at one point in time. As such, they could not determine whether the observed differences were actually caused by musical training, or if existing anatomical differences predispose some to become musicians. But later, longitudinal studies that track people over time have shown that young children who do 14 months of musical training exhibit significant structural (pdf) and functional brain changes (pdf) compared to those who do not. Together, these studies show that learning to play a musical instrument not only increases grey matter volume in various brain regions, but can also strengthen the long-range connections between them. Other research shows that musical training also enhances verbal memory, spatial reasoning, and literacy skills, such that professional musicians usually outperform non-musicians on these abilities. Long-lasting benefits for musicians Importantly, the brain scanning studies show that the extent of anatomical change in musicians' brains is closely related to the age at which musical training began, and the intensity of training. Those who started training at the youngest age showed the largest changes when compared to non-musicians. Even short periods of musical training in early childhood can have long-lasting benefits. In one 2013 study, for example, researchers recruited 44 older adults and divided them into three groups based on the level of formal musical training they had received as children. Participants in one group had received no training at all; those in the second had done a little training, defined as between one and three years of lessons; and those in the third had received moderate levels of training (four to 14 years). The researchers played recordings of complex speech sounds to the participants, and used scalp electrodes to measure the timing of neural responses in a part of the auditory brainstem . As we age, the precision of this timing deteriorates, making it difficult to understand speech, especially in environments with a lot of background noise. Participants who had received moderate amounts of musical training exhibited the fastest neural responses, suggesting that even limited training in childhood can preserve sharp processing of speech sounds and increase resilience to age-related decline in hearing. More recently, it has become clear that musical training facilitates the rehabilitation of patients recovering from stroke and other forms of brain damage, and some researchers now argue that it might also boost speech processing and learning in children with dyslexia and other language impairments. What's more, the benefits of musical training seem to persist for many years, or even decades, and the picture that emerges from this all evidence is that learning to play a musical instrument in childhood protects the brain against the development of cognitive impairment and dementia. Unlike commercial brain training products, which only improve performance on the skills involved, musical training has what psychologists refer to as transfer effects - in other words, learning to play a musical instrument seems to have a far broader effect on the brain and mental function, and improves other abilities that are seemingly unrelated. "Music reaches parts of the brain that other things can't," says Loveday. "It's a strong cognitive stimulus that grows the brain in a way that nothing else does, and the evidence that musical training enhances things like working memory and language is very robust." Learning to play a musical instrument, then, seems to be one of the most effective forms of brain training there is. Musical training can induce various structural and functional changes in the brain, depending on which instrument is being learned, and the intensity of the training regime. It's an example of how dramatically life-long experience can alter the brain so that it becomes adapted to the idiosyncrasies of its owner's lifestyle.

Tue, 25 Oct 2016 13:25 UTC Officials say more than 900 wildfires have destroyed over 100,000 acres across the state this month amid an ongoing drought that has no signs of ending anytime soon. Interim State Forester Gary Cole said in a statement Monday that extremely dry conditions have created favorable environments for wildfires during the past several weeks. "The drought creates a dangerous scenario where wildfire can quickly spread out of control, destroying forestland and threatening homes," Cole said. Gov. Robert Bentley on Oct. 12 signed a drought emergency declaration, putting 46 counties under the no burn order. Cole says that order will remain in effect until weather conditions have significantly improved. Citing a 10-day forecast of low potential for rainfall, Cole says there is "no relief in sight." Violators of the burn ban could face a fine of up to $500 and up to six months in jail if convicted. Source: Associated Press

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 13:29 UTC © The Free Thought Project Dramatic video from Intercept reporter, Jihan Hafiz , was released this week from the Dakota Access Pipeline protests showing a full on assault by militarized police on peaceful people. The video is from Saturday but took several days to be released as cops confiscated the camera used to film it. The video was taken as water protectors and reporters covering the protests marched toward the construction site. However, their peaceful walk was swiftly interrupted by militarized shock troops armed with massive cans of pepper spray, batons, rubber bullets, and assault rifles. According to Hafiz, the march was undertaken in solidarity with several protesters who had chained themselves to bulldozers and pipeline machinery at the construction site. But the marchers never made it to their destination. Instead, they were attacked by police forces who used pepper spray and beat protesters with batons. Dozens of officers, backed by military trucks, police vans, machine guns, and nonlethal weapons, violently approached the group without warning. "Don't move, everyone is under arrest," a voice says from the military vehicle that appears to be equipped with a Long Range Acoustic Hailing Device, or LRAD. As protesters attempted to leave, the police surrounded them and began their attack. According to Hafiz, several women were targeted for leading the march and dragged from the crowd to be arrested. Police body slammed one man and another woman's ankle was broken as she ran. The militarized police then circled the protesters in an apparent move to 'kettle' them — a tactic usually reserved for urban protests in which riot police force large crowds into corners to seemingly provoke them. However, the protesters stayed entirely peaceful. Police continued their mass arrests even though the people were trying to leave. Some natives were seen running for the hills as the assault began. One officer is seen in military camouflage with a ski mask and a tear gas grenade launcher — as if he were going to war . In total, reports Hafiz, more than 140 people were detained in half an hour. It was the largest roundup of protesters since the movement against the pipelines intensified two months ago. A majority of those arrested were charged with rioting and criminal trespass. Overall, close to 300 people have been arrested since protests against the pipeline kicked off over the summer. Among those arrested were journalists, a teen child who was also pregnant, and an elderly woman. They were all brought to the jail where protesters were forced to sit in the jail's common area as police had no other place to put them. According to Hafiz, women were strip searched, protesters were refused phone calls, and no one received food or water. One woman even had her medication confiscated by police, causing her to shake and sweat profusely. When Hafiz was finally released, she attempted to get back her camera and was told that she could not have it back. "Your camera is being held as evidence in a crime," they said. In the land of the free, filming cops assault peaceful men, women, and children is considered a 'crime.' Over the past several weeks, the police state has come out in full force as Native Americans fight to protect their water sources from the threat of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Mainstream media has remained largely silent as federal, state and local authorities worked on behalf of Energy Transfer Partners to squash dissent. Even prominent journalists, like Hafiz, have found themselves targets of the State, charged with dubious "crimes" such as " inciting a riot " and " conspiracy to theft of services " - for doing nothing more than filming protests and the ensuing violent crackdowns. As the video below shows, the First Amendment is no obstacle when it comes to advancing the interests of the corporatocracy. Comment: We are one breath away from an all out massacre!

Juice News Thu, 27 Oct 2016 14:46 UTC The Dakota Access pipeline is a fracked oil pipeline that is part of the Bakken pipeline that will run through North Dakota South Dakota, Idaho and Illinois. In the process, oil will travel beneath the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers and across Indian Reservation land. Bulldozers working on the pipeline have already destroyed the graves of the ancestors and relatives the Standing Rock Sioux and other Lakota tribes. Irreplaceable, unique, historic Indian sacred sites have also been destroyed. The pipeline is part of a concerted effort by the US government to gain "energy independence" and be in a position to supply oil and gas to Europe as an alternative to Russian gas. It is a literal pipe dream in both respects given that the US cannot wean itself off its massive addiction to and greed for oil and energy and the fact that Europe will be dependent on Russia oil and gas for decades to come. The pipeline not only threatens the environment in the USA including the drinking water supply from the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, but also the American people given that fracking has been implicated in earthquakes .

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 11:40 UTC © Joshua Lott / Reuters It will take close to two centuries for women to earn the same as men, according to the World Economic Forum's latest report. The annual Global Gender Gap Report was released Tuesday and found economic disparity between the sexes is on the rise. When looking at income and employment, we are back to similar levels of inequality seen during the 2008 financial crash. "At the current rate of change, and given the widening economic gender gap since last year, it will not be closed for another 170 years," the report read. The Gender Gap Index uses economics, education, health and political empowerment to rank 144 countries that have enough available data to use. Last year's report estimated it would take 118 years for economic equality to be achieved. Iceland, Finland, Norway and Sweden were the best countries on the Global Gender Gap Index having closed the gender gap in more than 80 percent of cases, but all still have disparities between the sexes. Rwanda and Ireland came fifth and sixth in the index. The UK came 20th and the US came 45th, falling 17 places from last year. Yemen came last. "There also continues to be a persistent wage gap in paid work," the report says. "Women's average earnings are almost half those of men, with average global earned income for women and men estimated at US$10,778 and $19,873, respectively. Countries that perform well in this dimension of gender parity span all regional and income groups." To examine economic participation and opportunity, the report looks at the ratio of female and male workers, wage equality for similar work and the ratio of women to men in various roles. The greatest gap between the sexes was found in political empowerment. The first Index was conducted in 2006 to track gender disparities and countries' progress over time.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 13:42 UTC Dead blue whale A dead whale was spotted floating near a beach in Daly City on Wednesday afternoon. Around 12:30 p.m., the whale was found floating about a quarter-mile off shore from Thornton State Beach in Daly City. The whale has now since drifter closer to shore, spokesperson Giancarlo Rulli said. The Marine Mammal Center was notified around 1:00 p.m., however they are unable to do anything until the whale has come ashore. According to the Marine Mammal Center, though the whale is only about a quarter mile offshore, they cannot predict when or where the whale will wash up. Researchers have determined that the whale is a male blue whale. Officials from the center have sent a team member to look at the whale but at this time, the age and size of the whale is unknown. The center, along with its partners including the California Academy of Sciences, have decided to not send a necropsy team out until the next day, on Thursday, as there are only a few hours of daylight left today. With the tide expected to rise Thursday, scientists hope the whale gets pushed up the beach so they will have more access to it, Rulli said.

Mint Press News Tue, 25 Oct 2016 13:50 UTC An inmate makes a sandwich while working in the employees' cafeteria at Coxsackie Correctional Facility in Coxsackie, N.Y. Food Services of America, a subsidiary of Services Group of America is funding efforts to keep marijuana illegal. It makes sense, considering that a vast majority of America's prisoners are locked in prison on marijuana charges, and the company stands to gain a lot of business from the laws staying the same. Marijuana.com report ed that the company donated $80,000 to a campaign committee opposing the legal cannabis measure on Arizona's November ballot. Services Group of America has been criticized in the past for providing food to prisons that failed to meet basic nutritional requirements. The report also indicated that the Arizona state Chamber of Commerce contributed $498,000 to the same campaign week. The effort also received a half million dollar donation from opioid maker Insys Therapeutics as well as sizeable contributions from various players in the alcohol industry. The influence that the alcohol and pharmaceutical industries have on keeping marijuana illegal has been well documented, but the influence of prison contractors is rarely discussed. The prison industry is one of the fastest growing and top-earning businesses in the United States. In the past three decades, this enterprise has grown into a monstrous system of oppression that now houses over 2 and a half million people in the US. This number is, by far, the largest prison population in the world. No country on earth has as many inmates as the "land of the free." Ironic isn't it? Since 1991 the violent crime rate in America has dropped at least 20%, while the amount of people in prison has increased by 50% in that time. These numbers show that the rapid growth in the prison population is primarily due to over prosecution of nonviolent crimes. This has nothing to do with "cleaning up the streets" or making our society safer — it is all about money and control. The prison system as it stands now does not make our society any safer but instead turns average nonviolent offenders into hardened criminals by exposing them to such a harsh environment. The sad truth is that the way our prison system has been structured has actually outlawed more than half of the US population. Nonviolent offenders have no place behind bars. The savage conditions of prison will turn most people into violent offenders once they get out. Which is exactly what the prison establishment wants - return customers. This establishment is the collection of state and quasi-state/private industries that make up the "prison industrial complex." Billions of dollars are made every year in this industry. One company, Wackenhut Corrections, makes over a billion dollars a year and they aren't even the biggest prison service in the country. Comment: It's a no brainer why the US has more prison inmates than any other country in the world, private prisons get slave labor and are making billions of dollars in profits! These numbers also don't take into consideration the many satellite businesses that surround this industry. There are over 1,000 vendors that specifically sell correctional paraphernalia. Even local phone companies cash in on the operation. The companies install payphones for free because those phones can generate $15,000 per year from each inmate making a phone call every day. Those companies are just the tip of the iceberg. That isn't even counting the police, lawyers, wardens, politicians and food distributors that line their pockets through the incarceration of peaceful Americans. All of these organizations have a distinct interest in keeping nonviolent people in jail. So, it should come as no surprise a prison contractor is working to keep marijuana illegal.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 13:01 UTC Arsen Pavlov, or Motorola, was the leader of the Sparta battalion in the war for Donbass. The people of Novorossiya (aka the Donbass) have suffered a terrible loss. Arsen Pavlov better known to the world as Motorola was assassinated in a brutal terrorist bombing on October 16, 2016. He was a beloved commander and a hero to the people of the Donbass, to Russia, and to people all over the world who oppose the fascist junta in Ukraine and US imperialism. The murder was no doubt ordered by the empire in revenge for Russia's intervention in Syria which one year later appears to have decisively shifted the war. On every front the SAA are making advances and winning new victories especially in the battle to fully liberate Aleppo from NATO's terrorist death squads. Thankfully after the treacherous bombing at Deir Ezzor Russia was in no mood to give into the empty threats of full scale nuclear war the empire claimed it was prepared to launch in order to halt the liberation of Eastern Aleppo. Slowly the SAA are making gains on multiple fronts in Eastern Ghoutha, in Homs, in Aleppo. Arsen Pavlov was born in the Komi Republic at 15 he became an orphan and moved in with a grandmother. He joined the Russian Naval Infantry where he gained the callsign Motorola. He joined as a conscript but volunteered to reenlist and served in the 2nd Chechen War where he gained valuable experience, and they say became addicted to war. He was a bit of an adrenaline junky which added to his charisma since he was paradoxically cheerful in the most dangerous situations. He had a great sense of humor which came through even to non-russian speakers like myself but he was even more beloved in Russia and Ukraine for his hilarious narrations of the war in Ukraine. He was involved in the war in Ukraine from the start. He visited Maidan where he overheard some Ukrainian fascists saying that they would kill ten Russians for every Ukrainian they lost. He decided to join the anti-maidan movement participating in counter-protests in Eastern Ukraine in Karkov and other cities before heading to Crimea to aid the people in fulfilling their long held dream of reuniting with Russia. It was in Crimea that he met Igor Strelkov who was impressed with his military experience and cheerful daring. Thus Motorola was one of the small group of men he brought with him to Slavyansk where a handful of veterans worked with the brave locals managing keep the Ukrainian Military tied down for months allowing vital time for Donetsk and Lugansk to solidify their defenses . In Slavyansk Strelkov and Motorola would become legends. Motorola became well known early on because not only was he a brave fighter he was also a master of information war. It was Motorola who filmed many of the early battles of the war and also helped sympathetic journalists cover the war from the front lines. He well understood that the wars of today are fought not just on the battlefields but on the internet, on youtube, on social media. He helped mobilize Global support for Novorossia's war to remain independent of fascist Ukraine inspiring volunteers from around the world. He was also able wage psychological warfare on the Ukrainians using his instincts as a prankster. He managed to convince the Ukrainians that there were 300 Chechen special forces aiding the Novorossian's in the area by playing a recording of the Muslim call to prayer every day. The paranoid Ukrainians fell for it and did not dare to invade the area. Motorola would go on to fight in many of the major battles of the war. He was not one of those commanders who lead from behind. Instead Motorola often fought on the front lines with his men. How could he ask his fighters to risk their lives when he would not do the same he would explain when questioned. Thus like the legendary Mozgovoi Motorola was reported dead many times in the course of the war by the Ukrainian media always reappearing to make a mockery of such claims. To do justice to his heroic actions in the war in Ukraine would require writing a history of much of the war since he was at so many famous battles Nikolayevka Semyonuka, Ilovaisk, Debaltsevo, Donetsk. He became the commander of the Spartak Battalion and was instrumental in liberating Donetsk airport from the fascist self styled "cyborgs." He had a beautiful and courageous wife and three children. He was Officially declared a Hero of Novorossia and honored in Last years victory parade celebrating both the victory over fascism in "The Great Patriotic War" as World War 2 is known in Russia but also the victories in the 2014-2015 wars of independence that saw the NATO backed Fascist Ukrainian army and it's death squad allies thoroughly smashed. Arsen Pavlov with his wife Yelena Kolenkina Read the rest of the article here . Comment: Further reading: The commander of the Sparta battalion of the Donetsk People's Republic and famous defender of Donbass known by his callsign "Motorola," Arsen Pavlov, was killed today, October 16th, by a bomb in his apartment building's elevator.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 14:10 UTC © Getty Images A lawyer for Gary Byrne, whose book " Crisis of Character: A White House Secret Service Officer Discloses His Firsthand Experience with Hillary, Bill, and How They Operate , " has sent notices to Media Matters for America and David Brock informing them that he intends to file suit. "Officer Byrne will bring legal action against you, in your personal capacity, and against Media Matters," a lawyer for the former Secret Service officer wrote to Brock, a loyal Clinton ally and the founder of the liberal advocacy group Media Matters. The letter requests Brock and Media Matters to "hold" all records and communications associated with their communications regarding Byrne — including "Any communication(s) between David Brock and The Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton" regarding the former Secret Service officer, suggesting there might be collusion between the campaign and her defenders. It also demands Brock "immediately and publicly retract any statement or inference by yourself and/or Media Matters to the effect that Officer Byrne was not fully truthful in recounting within 'Crisis of Character' details from any previous testimony." Additionally, Byrne's attorney demanded a retraction for "the utterly false statement(s) that Officer Byrne was not in close proximity to President William Jefferson Clinton." His lawyer states that "some of our best witnesses to such immediacy are George Stephanopoulos, John Podesta, Leon Panetta, Bruce Lindsey, Hillary Rodham Clinton and President Clinton himself — who appear to have already confirmed ... under oath ... the regular proximity of Officer Byrne to the President for many years." Byrne claims the liberal advocacy group tried to hurt his credibility to defend the Clintons. Lawyers for Brock and Media Matters, Marc Elias and Ezra Reese, acknowledged receiving the letter from Byrne's lawyer. Elias is also a lawyer for Hillary Clinton's presidential election campaign. Byrne, who has been a surrogate for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, told The Post , "We're moving forward with the suit regardless" of whether retractions are issued. My goal here is to get the message out - that everything in my book is true." Byrne has sent a similar letter — and has threatened similar legal action — to Jan Gilhooly, president of the Association of Former Agents of the United States Secret Service, who also questioned the claims made in " Crisis of Character. " Byrne expects the legal filings to come after the November presidential election.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 15:01 UTC © Sputnik/ Hikmet Durgun Ankara will benefit from the Mosul operation in case the city is not divided into sectarian areas after liberation, Yasar Yakis, Turkey's former minister of foreign affairs, told Sputnik on the sidelines of the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi. "Benefits for Ankara from Mosul operation will depend on what will be done in Mosul after ISIS [Daesh] is cleared from there, whether it will be divided into six small pockets according to ethnic and confessional and sectarian divides. Because there are Turkmens there, but 60 percent of them are Shia, 40 percent of Turkmens are Sunni, then there are also Kurds, non-Muslims, and Arabs. So if six cantons are to be established there, then do we sow the seeds of the new conflict? Because it will not be a monolith composition... We should not create new problems," Yakis said. He said that getting rid of sectarianism in this issues would be best for Turkey. "If Turkey can secure this and prevent Shia militants from entering the center of the city, which is inhabited by Sunnis, this would be the best gain for Turkey," Yakis said. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Abadi announced the start of a military operation to recapture Mosul from Daesh, outlawed in Russia, with the help of airstrikes by the US-led international coalition. According to local media, about 30,000 Iraqi soldiers and 4,000 Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are taking part in the operation. Turkey has repeatedly said it is willing to take part in the operation, though Iraq has raised objections.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 15:33 UTC © Jonathan Ernest/Reuters Donald Trump called for a "new deal for black America" in a Wednesday afternoon address as he works to bridge the gap he faces with the crucial voting bloc less than two weeks from Election Day. Speaking in Charlotte, N.C., the GOP presidential nominee criticized years of Democratic rule for leaving black America behind and outlined his plan to help. My "deal is grounded in three promises: safe communities, great education and high-paying jobs," Trump said, speaking off what appeared to be scripted remarks "Whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion. We live in a very divided country, and I will be your greatest champion." Trump called on voters to repudiate Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her party in favor of change. "American politics is caught in a time loop. We keep electing the same people over and over and over," he said. "Every day, I'm out on the trail proposing fresh solutions and new thinking. And every day, the same people, getting rich off our broken system, say we can't change and we can't try anything new, because it's not good for them." The subdued beginning of his speech stood in sharp contrast to the fiery tack Trump usually takes at his campaign rallies, which are meant to inject his brand of politics directly into the veins of his supporters. "I have a message for all the doubters in Washington: America's future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics and not the critics," he said. "African-American citizens have sacrificed so much for our nation. They fought and died in every war since the Revolution and from the pews and the picket lines, they've lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for civil rights. Yet too many African-Americans have been left behind." Trump called for incentives to move companies into blighted neighborhoods to bolster employment, help African-Americans get better access to credit and push cities to declare "blighted communities" disaster areas to help rebuild infrastructure. He also said he'd support increasing the number of police officers in such areas, connecting a lack of officers to a rise in murder rate in major cities. But while Trump's call focused on removing "gang members and criminal cartels," he blamed Clinton for promoting a "war on police." He did not mention the accusations of police brutality by minorities who feel that they are disproportionately targeted. It's not the first time Trump has made a direct appeal to black voters — overtures first appeared in scripted speeches in the late summer. He's struggled to gain traction with minority voters in general in polls: He won just 20 percent of the nonwhite vote in a recent CNN/ORC poll, 25 percent of nonwhite voters in Quinnipiac University's recent poll and 17 percent in the recent Fox News poll. Black voters were an important voting block for then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) when he upset Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in North Carolina in the 2008 presidential election.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 15:29 UTC The United States has called for a special meeting with Russia over alleged violations of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty - a landmark Cold War-era agreement. Washington wants the Special Verification Commission (SVC) to discuss the problems related to the treaty's compliance . The event is expected to take place in mid-November. The INF set up the Special Verification Commission as a way to deal with disputes surrounding the treaty. Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan can also attend the meeting because they housed intermediate range missiles before the disintegration of the Soviet Union and remain parties to the treaty. No SVC meeting has been convened since 2003. Russia welcomes the United States' offer. «We have responded positively», said Mikhail Ulyanov, the head of Foreign Ministry's Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Department. The treaty, which bans testing, producing, and possessing ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 to 5,500 kilometers, eliminated an entire class of missiles from Europe, and set up an extensive system of verification and compliance. Two years ago, the United States first asserted that Russia was in violation of the treaty , by developing a missile system that fell within the INF prohibitions. Last year, Rose Gottemoeller, the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, said that Russia risked provoking «military and economic countermeasures» if it continued to stonewall the INF issue. The US has not released any specifics about which exactly Russian missile is the source of the violation. It should be noted that if Washington cannot present compelling evidence of the Russian non-compliance, the United States could be seen by the world as the party that killed the INF Treaty . The only thing the State Department has said is that an unspecified Russian ground-launched cruise missile breaches the agreement. The issue has been in focus of US media outlets recently. For instance, an article published by The New York Times on October 19 said « Russia appears to be moving ahead with a program to produce a ground-launched cruise missile». According to the article, «the concern goes beyond those raised by the United States in July 2014, when the Obama administration said that Russia had violated the 1987 treaty on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces». On the very same day, The Wall Street Journal chimed in saying «The US is escalating a dispute with Russia over its accusations that Moscow possesses banned missile technology» . On October 17, two top House Republican chairmen - House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (Texas) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (Calif.) - wrote a letter to the US president saying «It has become apparent to us that the situation regarding Russia's violation has worsened, and Russia is now in material breach of the treaty» . Russia, in turn, has accused the US of violating the pact. According to Russia's officials, the Aegis Ashore missile defense system that the US has activated in Romania and plans to install in Poland represents a violation of the treaty. Aegis Ashore uses the naval Mk-41 launching system, which is capable of firing long-range cruise missile. This is a blatant violation of the INF Treaty provisions. The treaty bans launchers capable of firing intermediate range missiles. Mk-41s deployed in Europe may launch short and intermediate range cruise missiles deep into Russian territory . A US intermediate range weapon launched from Romania or Poland would require only a short flight time to reach beyond the Urals. Russia has also said that American armed drones violate the treaty. The US plans to arm tactical aviation in Europe with modernized B61-12 guided warheads will virtually nullify all the benefits of the INF Treaty from the point of view of Russia's security. The aircraft could fly from bases in Lithuania, Estonia and Poland to Russia's largest cities in 15-20 minutes - not that much longer than the flight time of the missiles scuttled by the INF treaty. If the US really wants the talks to produce a positive result, all these concerns should be part of the agenda. The SVC meeting will take place against the background of Russia's withdrawal from the plutonium disposal deal with the US because of Washington's non-compliance , recent movement of nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad , rising tensions over NATO's ground forces to deploy near Russian borders in 2017, US withdrawal from the agreement over Syria and apparent disintegration of arms control regime. Only political unity among the major global powers can reverse the disintegration process. Non-compliance, technical or material, is not the only problem the INF faces. Russia and the US adherence to the treaty's provisions does not prevent other countries from efforts to acquire ground-based intermediate range nuclear capability. The treaty should become multilateral. Russia and the US could cooperate in an effort to reach this goal with the help of the United Nations. It may be kind of forgotten today as so many things have happened since then, but in October 2007 Russia and the United States issued a joint statement to call on all countries to join a global INF Treaty addressing the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) of the UN General Assembly. Setting the existing differences aside, the parties could revive the process in an effort to involve other states. The SVC meeting may become a venue for addressing other issues related to arms control. The concerns are there. Candid talk is the best way to address the burning problems of mutual interest. The US has demonstratively refused to discuss the host of problems related to the ballistic missile defense in Europe. This stance is erroneous. The US should change its approach to the problem. The two great powers do need a venue for arms control dialogue. The reached agreement to restart contacts within the framework of SVC against the background of US presidential election gives hope that the tide may gradually turn. Comment: As usual, the U.S. blames Russia for what the U.S. is doing. And as usual, they provide no evidence or argumentation. They can't even say which Russian "missile" violates the treaty! Thankfully, these talks will give Russia the opportunity of bringing up the issue of the U.S.'s very real violation of the INF treaty.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 15:03 UTC © EPA Montenegro's Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic has resigned, hours after suggesting that Russia was involved in an alleged coup attempt on the country's election day and accusing the opposition of collaborating with the Kremlin. Djukanovic said on October 25 that there was "a strong connection of a foreign factor" in the October 16 vote, which was marked by the arrest of 20 people suspected of planning armed attacks against the prime minister and his supporters after parliamentary election results were announced. Comment: 20 Serbs arrested in Montenegro over planning armed attacks on election day - police Russia has strongly opposed Djukanovic's bid to join NATO and the European Union while opposition leaders made frequent visits to Moscow ahead of the vote. The Montenegro prosecutor's office has alleged that the detained group planned to attack people in front of parliament after the vote results were proclaimed, then storm the building and arrest Djukanovic. Opposition parties cried foul, however, charging that Djukanovic -- whose pro-Western party won the election but did not secure a parliamentary majority -- staged the alleged coup attempt to try to extend his quarter century of dominance over Montenegrin politics. But, not long after implicating Russia in the plot, Djukanovic announced he was stepping down and would not continue as prime minister. His Democratic Party of Socialists said it would nominate his deputy Dusko Markovic to replace him. It is not clear if there is any connection between Djukanovic's claims of a coup attempt and his sudden departure. Among those arrested in the purported coup plot was a former commander of Serbia's special police forces. Djukanovic said authorities would investigate the extent of the involvement in the alleged coup attempt both by Russia and Serbia. Montenegro split from Serbia after an independence vote in 2006. "There should be no panic... We will find out the facts," Djukanovic told reporters. Russia has launched a propaganda campaign to keep both Montenegro and Serbia, which is also seeking EU membership, within its sphere of influence. Both countries are traditional Christian Orthodox allies. After first denying that Serbia was involved in Montenegro's election, Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said on October 24 that an unspecified number of people were arrested in Serbia who provided evidence of a plot in Montenegro. Vucic said the people arrested were not connected to politicians in either country, but had ties to a third country and criminal groups. He did not name the country.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 15:33 UTC Danney Williams and Bill Clinton YouTube on Wednesday terminated the account of Danney Williams, the 30-year-old man who has claimed since the 1990s to be the black son of former President Bill Clinton. But YouTube suddenly reversed its decision on Thursday amid public outcry and reinstated the account in the early morning hours, posting a notice that said only: "After a review of your account, we have confirmed that your YouTube account is not in violation of our Terms of Service. As such, we have unsuspended your account." When it terminated the account on Wednesday, YouTube cited unspecified "repeated or severe violations of our Terms of Use and/or Community Guidelines" and declared the account "cannot be restored." The YouTube decision to terminate Williams' account blocked the nine-minute feature "BANISHED - The Untold Story of Danney Williams," which had received 1.2 million views since Williams posted it last week. Produced by filmmaker Joel Gilbert, it drew nearly 100,000 views per day and more than 1,000 viewer comments , with the overwhelming majority expressing support for Williams and outrage at the Clintons for not being willing to allow a DNA test to determine paternity. "My YouTube account has been deleted, but the same video appears in 50 other places on YouTube alone," Williams said on his Facebook page after being notified of YouTube's decision to suspend the account. "[YouTube] can't handle the truth! Please share #BillClintonSon." Twitter also continued to allow Williams to post the "Banished" video on Danney Williams' page , but the Twitter link to YouTube displayed the message : "This video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated. Sorry about that." The video is still running on Danney Williams-Clinton's Facebook page , as well as on the YouTube channel operated by Gilbert. Attempt to silence Danney Williams? Gilbert told WND on Wednesday he helped Williams file an online appeal form on YouTube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated. "The behavior of YouTube/Google in suspending Danney's account is outrageous! There have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any YouTube terms or guidelines," Gilbert said. Gilbert was outspoken in charging YouTube with partisan political motives. "The only possible explanation is that the Clinton campaign requested YouTube/Google to silence Danney, 'to run him off the plantation' as Danney said Hillary Clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the Arkansas governor's mansion in 1990," Gilbert said. "Danney cannot be silenced any longer," he continued. "Hillary may try to sweep Danney Williams under the rug, but it's not going to work this time. His story is out there, and every day more and more people understand Bill and Hillary Clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin." See the Danney Williams video feature: WND reported Oct. 19 that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate, attorneys for Williams were in Las Vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding DNA evidence from the former president. Accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating Williams that went viral on the Internet. No definitive DNA test WND reported that no DNA test was conducted in 1999, despite media reports to the contrary when Williams' claim first surfaced. Clinton defenders since 1999 have contended the tabloid Star Magazine conducted a "DNA showdown" proving Bill Clinton was not Williams' father, citing Star Magazine editor Phil Bunton saying at the time, "There was no match, nothing even close." But in an interview, Bunton told WND that no blood sample was obtained from Clinton and Star Magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test. "I don't remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on Clinton's DNA," Bunton told WND. Bunton is now the owner of the Rivertown Magazine in Haverstraw, New York. He affirmed to WND that the tabloid relied on the DNA evidence for Clinton published by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, extracted from the infamous Monica Lewinsky blue dress. "We got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media, including the New York Times, wanting to know when we were going to get the DNA back," Bunton recalled to WND. "We thought it was going to turn out to be his son, but when the DNA came back there was no story there even to write." The DNA test released by Kenneth Starr was the second of two DNA laboratory tests the FBI had run on Clinton, but the public record leaves no doubt that Starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the FBI. 'Twitter rules' Many other figures who have challenged the Democratic Party or the left-leaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets, including James O'Keefe and his Project Veritas, which has exposed Clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hidden-camera videos. Just as O'Keefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud Oct. 13, Twitter shut down his account , claiming violations of "Twitter Rules." The notice said he "must delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules, which prohibit: harassing other users, threatening other users, disclosing other users' private information" or violating "other rules." In a statement, O'Keefe said he relies on social media to "bypass the media and directly reach the public." On Monday, O'Keefe wrote in a tweet Project Veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to YouTube, calling the apparent block "bizarre." Earlier this month, O'Keefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a Hillary Clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day. His account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hidden-camera video that exposed a Clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns, the Daily Caller reported . Project Veritas posted an undercover video Oct. 17 proving Hillary Clinton supporters were inciting violence at Donald Trump rallies to gain negative media coverage. Millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours, but it didn't show up on Google's "trending" list on YouTube, which Google owns, noted SilenceisConsent.net . It did, however, trend on Twitter, which Google does not own. Breitbart blogger Milo Yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by Twitter minutes before his "Gays for Trump" party at the Republican National Convention. For some 11 months, the makers of the new movie "I'm Not Ashamed," about the first victim of the Columbine killers in Colorado in 1999, were unable to promote their movie through YouTube. The trailer was taken down late in 2015, and the movie's entire channel was suspended . Among the conservatives censored by Facebook : Conservative activist and Trump supporter Lauren Southern received a 30-day ban from Facebook because she complained about a friend's account being censored. Facebook locked a 12-year-old black middle schooler's account for posting a video supporting Rudy Giuliani's comment that Obama "doesn't love America." The admin of a pro-Trump group was banned for saying Trump is not anti-Muslim, but anti-ISIS.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 15:15 UTC With all eyes on Russia's unveiling their latest nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which NATO has dubbed the "SATAN" missile , as tensions with the U.S. increase, Moscow's most potent "weapon" may be something drastically different. The rapidly evolving geopolitical "weapon" brandished by Russia is an ever increasing stockpile of gold, as well as Russia's native currency, the ruble. Take a look at the symbol below, as it could soon come to change the entire hierarchy of the international order - potentially ushering in a complete international paradigm shift - and much sooner than you might think. The symbol is the new designation of the Russian ruble, Russia's national currency. Similar to how the U.S. uses the dollar sign ($), the U.K. uses the pound sign (£), and the European Union uses the euro symbol (€), Russia is about to begin exporting its symbol internationally. After the failed "reset" in U.S./Russian relations by the Obama administration, and the continued deterioration of the countries relationship, Washington began targeting entire sectors of the Russian economy, as well as specific individuals, meant to impose an economic burden so severe that it would force Moscow into compliance. Instead of decimating Russia, what it precipitated was a Russian response of gradually weaning themselves off of the hegemony of the U.S. petrodollar, and working with China to create an alternative to the SWIFT payment system that isn't solely controlled by Western interests (see Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , New Development Bank). According to the Corbett Report : New reports indicate that China is ready to launch its SWIFT alternative, and for those who have their ear to the ground this is the most significant move yet in the unfolding process of de-dollarization that is seeing the BRICS-led "resistance bloc" breaking away from the financial stranglehold of the US-led "Washington Consensus." For those who don't know, SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication and is shorthand for the SWIFTNet Network that is used by over 10,500 financial institutions in 215 countries and territories to transmit financial transaction data around the world. SWIFT does not do any of the clearing or processing for these transactions itself, but instead sends the payment orders that are then settled by correspondent banks of the member institutions. Still, given the system's near universality in the financial system, it means that virtually every international transaction between banking institutions goes through the SWIFT network. This is why de-listing from the SWIFT network remains one of the primary financial weapons wielded by the US and its allies in their increasingly important financial warfare campaigns. Recently, financial guru Jim Rickards, author of the book " Currency Wars ," wrote that "Russia is poised for a major comeback in its economy. Russian bonds and stocks and the Russian currency, the ruble, will all benefit." Rickards believes a "strong turnaround" is coming within Russia, and that this comeback will benefit the ruble. While still suffering from the economic warfare being waged by the U.S., Russia has realized that as long they are subservient to the petrodollar, there remains a clear and present danger of the Russian economy being devastated by the whims of Washington. The Bank of Russia, that nation's central bank, is extremely clear about its mission, and monetary policy declaring on its website: Monetary policy constitutes an integral part of the state policy and is aimed at enhancing well-being of Russian citizens. The Bank of Russia implements monetary policy in the framework of inflation-targeting regime, and sees price stability, albeit sustainably low inflation, as its priority. Given structural peculiarities of the Russian economy, the target is to reduce inflation to 4% by 2017 and maintain it within that range in the medium run. In layman's terms, that means that monetary policy, similar to nuclear weapons and the military, are "an integral part of the state policy" in Russia. While many analysts have noted the increased build-up in Russia's military arsenal, seemingly few have highlighted the massive build-up of Russian gold reserves over the past decade. Below is a chart showing Russian gold reserves between 1994 and last year, 2015: Since 2006, there has been a year-on-year increase that reveals a significant upward trend. The chart clearly reveals that Russia's state policy of increasing state monetary assets, in the form of gold. Additionally, the Russian government has been converting state rubles into gold assets. From 2006 to 2015, Russia's state holdings of gold tripled. Within just the past year Russia has substantially increased its gold holdings According to the Business Insider : In July of this year, the central bank of Russia added 200,000 ounces of gold to its reserves. The one-month uptick in Russian gold reserves — 200,000 ounces — is approximately equal to the entire annual output of Barrick Gold's Turquoise Ridge gold mine in Nevada. At that same rate — 200,000 ounces per month — in a mere five months, Russia would add to state gold reserves the equivalent of the entire annual output of Barrick's massive Goldstrike mine in Nevada . Currently, Russian gold reserves rank seventh in the world. It's clear that there is a concerted effort by Russian authorities to build up the country's gold reserves as part of a national strategy to negate the effects of economic warfare waged by the United States. Rickards, in his 2011 book " Currency Wars ," theorized that Russia and China could combine their gold reserves to form a global gold-backed currency to compete against the U.S. dollar. Currently, Russian reserves stand at roughly 1,500 tonnes, with Chinese reserves totaling over 1,800 tonnes (according to China — it's likely more), which would amount to a combined total of roughly 3,300 tonnes of gold. The U.S. is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the International Monetary Fund (IMF), thus the U.S. lockup on global gold is about to vanish, according to Business Insider. Imagine for a moment the distinctly real possibility that Russian-Chinese alliance could exercise indirect (or even direct) control over the IMF's gold reserve of over 2,800 tonnes. Russian, Chinese and IMF gold combined would equal roughly 6,100 tonnes, and would allow for direct competition with the U.S. gold reserves, estimated at 8,100 tonnes. Russia and China have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by Washington as it's weapon of choice when opposing a well-armed state, and clearly see the writing on the wall - thus working together to create a new global financial paradigm. The reality is that the United States is $20 trillion dollars in debt, and eventually the time will come when the U.S. economy begins to implode — and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper it's printed on. Hard assets, such as gold and silver, should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so, as a means of hedging against the potentially disastrous results of the U.S. using the petrodollar as a "weapon." Ultimately, the United States, Russia and China are all controlled by centralized power-hungry tyrants attempting to command powerful global bureaucracies like the IMF, the World Bank, SWIFT, New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. It's not Russian nuclear weapons that people should fear, as the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially voids any benefit of a state launching a first-strike nuclear attack. The true threat to America is our economic house of cards, built upon the back of a neoliberal trade policy that puts the "rights" of corporations over that of people .

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 15:17 UTC © Pascal Rossignol / Reuters Some have faced criticism in their own country for aiding asylum seekers, while others are themselves migrants who have seen their accommodation centers burnt down. RT Russian talked to residents and volunteers at migrant centers in Germany. Miriam Düsterhöft, 27, studies social science at university and believes that working at one of the refugee centers in Düsseldorf, Germany, will be a good experience. Düsterhöft told RT Russian that she wants to help refugees to integrate into Europe. "At first it was very difficult. There was a lack of essentials, it was hard to communicate with refugees. Many didn't make any effort to learn German," she said. One of the issues at the center was a lack of interpreters of Persian or Kurdish. There was a man who translated from Arabic for men, and a woman translating for female residents. "[Kurdish and Persian] women do not communicate with men, they are afraid to speak about certain things. Even we [volunteers] don't know what they feel or need." Asylum seekers have to spend at least six months at the center before authorities can grant them refugee status and provide them with accommodation. Sometimes they have to wait longer before receiving the status, or because the condition of the accommodation provided is much worse than that of the center, Düsterhöft said. Düsterhöft's style of clothing at the center differs greatly from what she wears in her everyday life. Here at the migrant center she wears long skirts and trousers, and covers her hands with sleeves. "This is my decision - I have a lot of tattoos all over my body, and I don't want to confuse people who aren't accustomed to this. I don't think that it infringes on my rights." "No one has ever tried to rape me," she added. This isn't a random comment - asylum seekers have been accused of numerous sexual harassment incidents towards women and children in Europe since the start of 2016. Earlier in October, a female interpreter for a French journalist was raped near the notorious Calais 'Jungle' migrant camp. Reports also emerged that the woman's attackers were three Pashto-speaking male asylum seekers. Düsterhöft said she hasn't had any major conflicts with refugees. The most serious incident was when the father of one child asked not to draw animals or humans during classes because Islam forbids the depiction of people. "We solved this issue and removed the controversial exercise," she said. 'There are bad people both among Europeans and migrants' The mother of 18-year-old student Fiona Braun, who is giving German lessons to refugees, says that her life hasn't changed with the arrival of asylum seekers. "My daughter works with refugee children from Syria and Afghanistan in camps in Vienna and in Bratislava," Jana Olearnikova told RT Russian. "She [Fiona] now has a lot of female friends among migrants. Fiona comes home with new recipes that she learned from the Arab girls," she said, adding that she welcomes "the opportunity to dive into Arab life" and likes "the diversity of cultures in Europe." Olearnikova said she's not afraid to walk alone in the evenings, despite the stories that have emerged since the refugee crisis started. "Of course, there may be criminals and bad people among migrants, but they may be among the Europeans, too," she said. Syrian refugee: 'ISIS killed my entire family, I have nowhere to go' Aid Abu Kasem was an architect back in Syria. He understands that when he receives refugee status, he won't be able to find the same job in Germany. "But I don't mind. The most important thing for me is to find myself in a new reality. I'm learning German, it's very difficult, but I'm trying," he told RT Russian. Kasem says it will be difficult for him to settle into his new home. "I know that in Germany there are common swimming pools and common saunas for men and women. They bathe together naked, although completely unfamiliar with each other. I can't understand it. I guess I just won't attend such places." He said that the center in the town of Zirndorf, Bavaria, where he is currently living, was set on fire twice. "It's unpleasant. I didn't do evil to anyone and shouldn't suffer for the fact that these people hate anyone who runs away from war." "ISIS [Islamic State/IS] killed my entire family, I have nowhere to go, so I decided to start a new life," he added.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 15:25 UTC Authorities are only 'contemplating' criminal charges against an East Cleveland police officer today after he discharged his weapon sending a bullet hurling into a day care center. The staff and children at the KinderCare Learning center were likely terrified when a bullet came blasting through the fence and lodged into the wall of the school around 3:35 pm on Tuesday. Police have refused to release the name of the officer who negligently discharged his firearm. Authorities did, however, note that the officer was unloading his 9mm Glock inside his home, directly behind the daycare, when it 'accidentally' discharged. Up until that point, the staff and parents of the children at KinderCare probably thought that their children were safer being neighbors with a police officer. Despite the officer clearly admitting to committing the misdemeanor offense of discharging a firearm within city limits, police have yet to charge him. "Right now our law department has it and they are reviewing it to see if there should be any charges," Police Chief Jack Davis said Wednesday morning. "It was a very unfortunate incident for the school, as well as him," he added. Outside of skating out of the misdemeanor charge so far, this officer also seems to be avoiding the felony offense of discharging a weapon in a gun-free school zone. Imagine for a moment that you were cleaning your pistol and all of the sudden, you accidentally squeeze off a round sending the deadly projectile through the wall of a daycare center, in a gun-free zone. There are two possible scenarios that would take place; the first one being that a SWAT team responds and you are killed. The second, less lethal result would be your inevitable arrest and charges of public endangerment, unlawful discharge, illegal use of a firearm, assault with a deadly weapon, terrorism, or a myriad of other charges associated with sending a deadly projectile hurling through walls and near the heads of innocent people. You would immediately be facing fines, jail time, probation, and firearms restrictions. However, if you are a government agent who's trusted with carrying a deadly weapon into places others cannot, you needn't worry about any of those repercussions as this case will likely prove. When the Akron Beacon Journal contacted the East Cleveland police department to inquire as to what would happen to this officer, they said their department was unaware of the incident. "We're just grateful that nobody was hurt," KinderCare spokeswoman Colleen Moran told Ohio.com. So are we. As the gun controllers call for guns to be taken out of the hands of US citizens, what they really mean is they only want cops to have guns. This cop proves how silly, and dangerous, that demand actually is.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 15:16 UTC A concert in Istanbul by the Dresden Orchestra to mark the 1915 genocide of Armenians by the Ottomans has been cancelled by Germany. That follows reports that the musicians sent out invitations to the Turkish President and his top aides. The concert, run by the renowned Dresden Symphony Orchestra, was scheduled to take place on November 13 in the German consulate in Istanbul. Called 'Aghet' or 'catastrophe' in Armenian, the performance was to commemorate the victims of the 1915 massacre that left around 1.5 million Armenians dead and hundreds of thousands forced to flee. Turkish President Recep Erdogan was personally invited to attend the event by the orchestra, along with other top Turkish politicians , including Prime Minister Binali Yildirim and Foreign Minister Melvut Cavusoglu, German T-Online news outlet reports , citing DPA news agency, which gained access to copies of the invitations. The invitations were made despite Erdogan taking a hard stance against Germany's recognition of the Armenian genocide - even threatening Germany with some "response measures." The concert was cancelled by Berlin . On Wednesday, the German Foreign Office said that "the premises in the Istanbul consulate are not available on November 13th," according to Deutsche Welle . Later in the day, orchestra director Markus Rindt said he received notification from the ministry with nearly the same content. "It's definitely been canceled. They said they wanted to reschedule at a better time, but when would that be? This has been planned for years ," Rindt told Reuters. The piece by the Dresden Symphony Orchestra includes musicians from Turkey, Armenia, Germany, and the former Yugoslavia. It premiered last year in Berlin with additional performances scheduled in Belgrade on November 5 and in the Armenian capital of Yerevan on November 10. The 'Aghet' has become one of several stumbling blocks in troubled Turkey-Germany relations. In April, the Turkish ambassador to the EU demanded that the bloc stop funding the project which received initial support from the European Commission's Executive Agency for Education, Audiovisual and Culture. On June 2, 2016, the German parliament almost unanimously passed a symbolic resolution recognizing the 1915 massacre of Armenians by Ottoman Turkish forces as 'genocide.' The move was praised by Armenia and sharply criticized by Turkey, which even tried to pressure Germany ahead of the vote. Following the move, Ankara recalled its ambassador to Germany , while Erdogan said that the government would discuss response measures. The mass killings began on April 24, 1915, when 250 Armenian intellectuals were detained by Ottoman authorities and later executed in Constantinople, present-day Istanbul. Most of the Ottoman Empire's Armenians were then displaced, deported, or placed in concentration camps on the pretext of rebelling and siding with Russia in World War I. Up to 1.5 million Armenians were affected by these measures. Turkey, the successor of the Ottoman Empire, concedes that many Armenians were mistreated at the time, but maintains that the number of victims has been grossly exaggerated. Comment: The Armenian genocide is one of Turkey's major political 'red lines' and a top priority for the Turkish lobby. (The parallels to Israel, the Nakbah, and the Israeli lobby should be obvious.) After relations between Germany and Turkey worsened this past year over the refugee crisis and Turkey's EU bid, Germany passed its Armenian genocide resolution. But after the failed coup, and with Turkey's alliance with the West shakier than ever, the Germans seem more willing to play nice. Back on September 2, FM Steinmeier made sure to reassure Turkey that the Bundestag resolution was " non-binding ". It looks like his latest event follows a similar line of force.

Tue, 25 Oct 2016 15:07 UTC © Getty Images The researchers compared believers in God to people with autism, saying both struggle to distinguish between the physical and the mental. Religious people are more likely to have a poorer understanding of the world and are more likely to believe objects like rocks and paper have human qualities, scientists say. Researchers at the University of Helsinki compared believers in God or the paranormal to people with autism after finding they tend to struggle to understand the realities of the world around us. Religious beliefs were linked with a weaker ability to understand physical and biological phenomenon such as volcanoes, flowers, rocks and wind without giving them human qualities. Believers were more likely to think that inanimate objects such as metal, oil, clothes and paper can think and feel, and agree with statements such as "Stones sense the cold". Marjaana Lindeman and Annika Svedholm-Häkkinen, who completed the study, said: " The more the participants believed in religious or other paranormal phenomena, the lower their intuitive physics skills, mechanical and mental rotation abilities, school grades in mathematics and physics, and knowledge about physical and biological phenomena were... and the more they regarded inanimate targets as mental phenomena" . The study defined "mental" as having human characteristics such as thoughts and sprit. Researchers said their findings suggest people's lack of understanding about the physical world means they apply their own, human characteristics to the whole universe, "resulting in belief in demons, gods, and other supernatural phenomena ". This confusion between mental and physical qualities "has [also] been recognised mainly among ancient people and small children", they added. The scientists compared religious believers to people with autism, saying both struggle to distinguish between the mental and the physical, although autistic people are at the opposite end of the spectrum because they often see the world as entirely physical and struggle to understand the mental state of others. Ms Lindeman and Ms Svedholm-Häkkinen asked 258 Finnish people to report how much they agreed that "there exists an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving God" and whether they believed in paranormal phenomena such as telepathy and visions of the future. They then matched their answers with a range of other factors, including exam results, survey answers and performances on different tests. They also found that people who believe in God and the paranormal are more likely to be women and tend to base their actions on instinct rather than analytical thinking. Previous studies have suggested religious people tend to have a lower IQ and are more likely to believe literally in what scientists called "bullshit statements" including phrases like "Earth wants water" and "Force knows its direction". However, they are also found to be happier and have greater life satisfaction than non-believers and are seen as more generous and trustworthy. Comment: Despite the overly materialistic view of the researchers (even quantum physics can seem a little mystical) the brains of religious people have bee found to work 'differently'.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 14:56 UTC South Korean electronics giant Samsung has reported a drop in third-quarter profit of 30 percent, following the disastrous recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. The company's overall operating profit fell to $4.6 billion which is the lowest level in two years. Its mobile division's operating profit collapsed 98 percent to just $88 million. Samsung said this month it will lose approximately $3.1 billion on the Note 7 recall over the next six months. The company has scrapped the entire line less than two months after its launch due to safety considerations. That followed a global recall of at least 2.5 million phones due to faulty batteries that could ignite. The manufacturer assured customers fixed devices were safe but the problems with overheating and fires continued. After weeks of unsuccessful attempts to save the brand's image, the electronics firm announced it was ending the production and sale of the Note 7's. The troubled smartphones have been banned by major airlines worldwide. "Regarding the mobile business, the company will focus on expanding sales of new flagship products with differentiated design and innovative features, as well as regaining consumers' confidence," Samsung said on Thursday. The company's new flagship smartphone, the Galaxy Note 8 is expected to be released in February. "Samsung has lost consumer confidence, but I think it still has at least one more chance. Rather than rushing to release the next product, it should conduct a thorough inspection and explain the results of its investigation into the Note 7, " Greg Roh an analyst at HMC Investment Securities told the BBC.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 14:52 UTC From the University of Sheffield and "The Day After Tomorrow" department comes this climate disaster movie plot wherein global warming, er, climate change, cause the polar jet stream to go wacky and freeze us extra good in winter. Really. No mention of what caused similar weather during the " Little Ice Age " between roughly AD 1300 and 1850 , except that they are sure they've ruled out "natural variation" now. The movie plot from IMDB : As Paleoclimatologist named Jack Hall is in Antartica, he discovers that a huge ice sheet has sheared off. But what he does not know is that this event will trigger a massive climate shift that will affect the world population. Meanwhile, his son Sam is with friends in New York to attend an event. There they discover that it has been raining non-stop for the past 3 days, and after a series of weather-related disasters begin to occur over the world, everybody realizes the world is entering a new Ice Age and the world population begins trying to evacuate to the warmer climates of the south. Jack makes a daring attempt to rescue his son and his friends who are stuck in New York and who have managed to survive not only a massive wave but also freezing cold temperatures that could possibly kill them. The paper press release via Eurekalert, they even have a scientist named "Hall": Extreme cold winters fueled by jet stream and climate change: Scientists agree for first time that climate change may be intensifying the effects of the jet stream , causing extreme cold weather in the UK and US Study could improve long-term forecasting of winter weather in most populous parts of the world More accurate forecasting could help communities, businesses and economies prepare for severe weather and make life and cost-saving decisions Scientists have agreed for the first time that recent severe cold winter weather in the UK and US may have been influenced by climate change in the Arctic, according to a new study. The research, carried out by an international team of scientists including the University of Sheffield, has found that warming in the Arctic may be intensifying the effects of the jet stream's position, which in the winter can cause extreme cold weather , such as the winter of 2014/15 which saw record snowfall levels in New York. Scientists previously had two schools of thought. One group believe that natural variability in the jet stream's position has caused the recent severe cold winter weather seen in places such as the Eastern United States and the UK. The other camp includes scientists who are finding possible connections between the warming of the Arctic - such as melting sea ice, warming air temperatures, and rising sea surface temperatures - and the emerging pattern of severe cold winter weather. Now, Professor Edward Hanna and Dr Richard Hall from the University's Department of Geography, together with Professor. James E. Overland from the US Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), have brought together a diverse group of researchers from both sides of the debate. The researchers have found that the recent pattern of cold winters is primarily caused by natural changes to the jet stream's position ; however, the warming of the Arctic appears to be exerting an influence on cold spells, but the location of these can vary from year to year. Previous studies have shown that when the jet stream is wavy there are more episodes of severe cold weather plunging south from the Arctic into the mid-latitudes, which persist for weeks at a time. But when the jet stream is flowing strongly from west to east and not very wavy, we tend to see more normal winter weather in countries within the mid-latitudes. "We've always had years with wavy and not so wavy jet stream winds, but in the last one to two decades the warming Arctic could well have been amplifying the effects of the wavy patterns," Professor Hanna said. He added: "This may have contributed to some recent extreme cold winter spells along the eastern seaboard of the United States, in eastern Asia, and at times over the UK (e.g. 2009/10 and 2010/11). "Improving our ability to predict how climate change is affecting the jet stream will help to improve our long-term prediction of winter weather in some of the most highly populated regions of the world. "This would be hugely beneficial for communities, businesses, and entire economies in the northern hemisphere. The public could better prepare for severe winter weather and have access to extra crucial information that could help make live-saving and cost-saving decisions." The study, Nonlinear response of mid-latitude weather to the changing Arctic, is published today (26 October 2016) in the journal Nature Climate Change on 26 October 2016. The research was partly sponsored by the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) and the Climate and Cryosphere (CliC) project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). It further cements the University's position at the forefront of climate change research and gives geography students at Sheffield access to the latest innovations in environmental science. Comment: In other words, "natural variations mostly account for the cold weather, but global warming causes cold weather"? Global warming stopped years ago, and is itself a natural variation over the long term. Humanity better face it: the global climate is self-regulating, and ice ages happen regularly. The Gulf Stream would probably be a better phenomenon to analyze in this regard: Fire and Ice: The Day After Tomorrow .

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 14:54 UTC © Sergey Kazak / Sputnik Russian strategic missile troops reportedly launched an RS-18 ballistic missile on Tuesday. The launch may have been a test of the advanced hypersonic glider warhead, which would be able to defeat US anti-missile systems. The test was conducted at midday from a site near the town of Yasny, Orenburg region, in the southern Urals, and the warhead reached the Kura test range in Kamchatka in Russia's Far East. "The test was a success. The warhead was delivered to Kura field," the Defense Ministry reported. Popular defense blog MilitaryRussia.ru says the launch was meant to test Russia's hypersonic glider warhead, currently known by its developer designation, 'object 4202', or Aeroballistic Hypersonic Warhead. A select few countries are currently developing the technology. The US has the HTV-2, a device developed by DARPA that has two partially successful tests under its belt. The Chinese warhead using the same technology is called DF-ZF, with Beijing first confirming a test in 2014. India is also studying hypersonic flight technology, but unlike Russia, the US and China, it is reportedly not developing a strategic missile warhead. A hypersonic glider vehicle (HGV) is different from a conventional ballistic missile warhead in that it travels most of the time in the stratosphere rather than in space. It gives an HGV-tipped missile greater range and may give anti-missile systems a shorter window to respond to an attack. More importantly, an HGV can maneuver during the approach to a target at high speed, making interception significantly harder, because it makes guiding an interceptor missile towards the attacking vehicle challenging and potentially impossible with current rocket technology. Object 4202 is reportedly meant to be used with Russia's next-gen heavy strategic missile the RS-28 Sarmat. Military experts estimate that the new ICBM, an image of which was first made public this week, may carry up to three HGVs as payload. A previous possible test of object 4202 was reported in April.

Mon, 24 Oct 2016 14:18 UTC © Matthew Jacobs Begonia species adapted to deep-shade conditions display blue leaf iridescence, a striking form of structural color originating from specialized chloroplasts in the epidermis. There's a very good reason for this plant's iridescent color. In the fading twilight on the rainforest floor, a plant's leaves glimmer iridescent blue. And now scientists know why. These exotic blue leaves pull more energy out of dim light than ordinary leaves because of an odd trick of quantum mechanics. A team of plant scientists led by Heather Whitney of the University of Bristol in the U.K. has just discovered the remarkable origin and purpose of the shiny cobalt leaves on the Malaysian tropical plant Begonia pavonina . The plant owes its glimmer to its peculiar machinery for photosynthesis, the process plants use to turn light into chemical energy. Strangely enough, these blue leaves can squeeze more energy out of the red-green light that reaches the eternally dim rainforest floor. Whitney and her colleagues describe the blue leaves today in the journal Nature Plants . "It's actually quite brilliant. Plants have to cope with every obstacle that's thrown at them without running away. Here we see evidence of a plant that's actually evolved to physically manipulate the little light it receives," says Whitney, "it's quite amazing, and was an absolutely surprising discovery." Slowing Down Light © Matthew Jacobs Begonia species adapted to deep-shade conditions display blue leaf iridescence, a striking form of structural color originating from specialized chloroplasts in the epidermis. These 'iridoplasts' contain highly-ordered grana whose arrangement enhances absorption Whitney and her colleagues made their fascinating discovery by working with a lab-grown crossbreed of two species of the the Begonia plant. The scientists couldn't simply use the native species found in the darkness of the Malaysian jungle, she says. It's absurdly delicate, grows slowly, and withers under anything less than perfect growing conditions. Instead, the scientists developed a much heartier breed that still sported the exotic blue leaves. The plant researchers then used an imaging tool called an electron microscope. Peering into the leaves' cellular structures, the scientists found that the plants had some peculiar chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are basically a plant's power generators—they're cellular capsules that hold all the machinery responsible conducting photosynthesis. In particular, Whitney and her colleagues noticed something funky with the spire-like structures called thylakoids found inside the chloroplast capsules. Thylakoids look like tiny towers, and the light that enters them is what's turned into chemical energy. Look inside the chloroplasts of most plants and you'd find these tower-like fairly randomly placed, like a slap-dash collection of buildings. But the thylakoids inside the Begonia's chloroplasts had a incredibly regular structure. Less like the irregular Manhattan skyline, and more like a planned city. According to Whitney, the rigid, precise structure of these thylakoids creates a couple of fascinating effects. First, their ordered placement means that the entire chloroplast capsules tend to reflect away blue wavelengths of light, which is why the leaves appear iridescent blue to our eyes. Losing this blue light isn't a problem for the Begonia plant's energy efficiency, since most blue light is absorbed by the rainforest growing above it anyway. Instead, the thylakoids are far better at absorbing red-green light, the flavor that tends to be most abundant in the perpetual dim of the rainforest floor. But here's the strangest quality of these cellular structures: Light itself actually slows down as it barrels through the Begonia plants' chloroplasts. That's due to the precise arrangement of the tower-like thylakoids, which together act like a dense crystal. While light always travels the same speed in a vacuum, it will slow down when passing through different types of matter. This effect is known in quantum physics as slow light . Combined with the increased uptake of red-green light, this effect increases the efficiency of the Begonia plant's photosynthesis up to 10 percent. Interestingly enough, Whitney says, the Begonia plants they studied had a mix of normal plant chloroplasts and the odd, highly ordered blue variety. "We think these serve a function almost like a backup generator," she says, "meaning the plant will use its [regular] chloroplasts if there's enough light, but can switch when the light levels get extremely low. "It's just wonderful and logical to think that a plant has evolved an ability to physically manipulate the lighting around it in a variety of different ways. I think it really raises the prospect that this type of phenomenon might even be more widespread than we realize in the plant kingdom. Perhaps we just don't notice other plants that are doing this because they don't have a strange color."

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 14:20 UTC © Andrew Cullen / Reuters Fracking has been banned in Maryland since last year, but next year's proposed regulations jeopardize the moratorium. While the planned regulations are strict, they would allow fracking - a practice which is opposed by the majority of voters. Maryland has a year until its moratorium on fracking expires, but voters are already being asked to consider new rules on the controversial practice. Those rules would introduce heavy regulations but leave room for the possibility to allow fracking. A statewide poll taken by OpinionWorks found that 56 percent of Maryland voters would support a complete, statewide ban on fracking. Fracking is the method of pumping water and various chemicals deep underground in order to extract natural gas. Only six percent of the voters in the Maryland poll believe fracking comes without any risks. The risks of fracking are still being studied and were part of the two-year moratorium issued in 2015. A study by the state's Department of Environment is expected to show the potential impact of fracking, then use those factors to develop industry guidelines. The department has until the end of the month to finalize its proposed regulations. With only 28 percent of polled voters opposing a complete ban on the practice, some Maryland politicians are looking to pass laws that would make the ban on fracking permanent. In September, State Senator Robert Zirkin (D-Baltimore County) told The Washington Post that he would push for a complete ban, saying "there is only one answer, and that is to ban fracking in the state." "If at some point in the future it is absolutely foolproof safe, then we can have another discussion," Zirkin added. "But as of 2016, multiple states have done this, and all of them have seen bad results." Other state lawmakers have kept their efforts local by trying to create small government regulations that would keep fracking out of their counties. Prince George's County banned the practice explicitly last spring, while Montgomery County effectively banned it through a change in its zoning laws. Comment: The oil and gas industry is battling tooth and nail to continue fracking as more communities are taking steps to institute bans - and with good reasons:

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 13:01 UTC Arsen Pavlov, or Motorola, was the leader of the Sparta battalion in the war for Donbass. The people of Novorossiya (aka the Donbass) have suffered a terrible loss. Arsen Pavlov, better known to the world as Motorola, was assassinated in a brutal terrorist bombing on October 16, 2016. He was a beloved commander and a hero to the people of the Donbass, to Russia, and to people all over the world who oppose the fascist junta in Ukraine and US imperialism. The murder was no doubt ordered by the empire in revenge for Russia's intervention in Syria which one year later appears to have decisively shifted the war. On every front the SAA are making advances and winning new victories especially in the battle to fully liberate Aleppo from NATO's terrorist death squads. Thankfully after the treacherous bombing at Deir Ezzor Russia was in no mood to give in to the empty threats of full-scale nuclear war the empire claimed it was prepared to launch in order to halt the liberation of eastern Aleppo. Slowly the SAA are making gains on multiple fronts in Eastern Ghouta, in Homs, in Aleppo. Arsen Pavlov was born in the Komi Republic. At 15 he became an orphan and moved in with a grandmother. He joined the Russian Naval Infantry where he gained the callsign Motorola. He joined as a conscript but volunteered to reenlist and served in the 2nd Chechen War where he gained valuable experience, and they say became addicted to war. He was a bit of an adrenaline junky which added to his charisma since he was paradoxically cheerful in the most dangerous situations. He had a great sense of humor which came through even to non-Russian speakers like myself but he was even more beloved in Russia and Ukraine for his hilarious narrations of the war in Ukraine. He was involved in the war in Ukraine from the start. He visited Maidan where he overheard some Ukrainian fascists saying that they would kill ten Russians for every Ukrainian they lost. He decided to join the anti-Maidan movement participating in counter-protests in eastern Ukraine in Kharkov and other cities before heading to Crimea to aid the people in fulfilling their long-held dream of reuniting with Russia. It was in Crimea that he met Igor Strelkov, who was impressed with his military experience and cheerful daring. Thus Motorola was one of the small group of men he brought with him to Slavyansk where a handful of veterans worked with the brave locals managing to keep the Ukrainian Military tied down for months, allowing vital time for Donetsk and Lugansk to solidify their defenses . In Slavyansk Strelkov and Motorola would become legends. Motorola became well known early on because not only was he a brave fighter he was also a master of information war. It was Motorola who filmed many of the early battles of the war and also helped sympathetic journalists cover the war from the front lines. He well understood that the wars of today are fought not just on the battlefields but on the internet, on youtube, on social media. He helped mobilize global support for Novorossia's war to remain independent of fascist Ukraine, inspiring volunteers from around the world. He was also able wage psychological warfare on the Ukrainians using his instincts as a prankster. He managed to convince the Ukrainians that there were 300 Chechen special forces aiding the Novorossians in the area by playing a recording of the Muslim call to prayer every day. The paranoid Ukrainians fell for it and did not dare to invade the area. Motorola would go on to fight in many of the major battles of the war. He was not one of those commanders who lead from behind. Instead Motorola often fought on the front lines with his men. How could he ask his fighters to risk their lives when he would not do the same?, he would explain when questioned. Thus, like the legendary Mozgovoi, Motorola was reported dead many times in the course of the war by the Ukrainian media, always reappearing to make a mockery of such claims. To do justice to his heroic actions in the war in Ukraine would require writing a history of much of the war since he was at so many famous battles - Nikolayevka Semyonuka, Ilovaisk, Debaltsevo, Donetsk. He became the commander of the Spartak Battalion and was instrumental in liberating Donetsk airport from the fascist self-styled "cyborgs." He had a beautiful and courageous wife and three children. He was officially declared a Hero of Novorossia and honored in last year's victory parade celebrating both the victory over fascism in "The Great Patriotic War", as World War 2 is known in Russia, but also the victories in the 2014-2015 wars of independence that saw the NATO-backed fascist Ukrainian army and its death squad allies thoroughly smashed. Arsen Pavlov with his wife Yelena Kolenkina Tragically after facing danger so many times on the battlefield Motorola was killed by a bomb in the elevator in his apartment building as he was returning to his family. The news was met with grief and rage the world over. In Donetsk huge crowds filled the streets to bury their fallen Hero. Ultimately whoever set the bomb was serving not merely the fascist puppet regime in Kiev but the CIA. Thats how the CIA operate in these dirty wars - they take control of their "allies" intelligence service through payoffs and sending in their advisers. Ukraine is little more than a NATO colony at this point . Thus we can be sure that someone in Washington green-lit the assassination. Like the bombing at Deir Ezzor this assassination is meant to bring the war in Ukraine to a suitable boil by the time Hillary takes over in a couple months. 2017 will probably see Ukraine erupt into full-blown war again. Of course the war never truly stopped with the Ukrainian army constantly shelling Novorossian civilians from a distance. There have been constant skirmishes. However, clearly things are escalating and the assassination of Motorola is part of a pattern that included a failed assassination attempt on Motorola this summer, plots to kill the Prime Ministers of Donetsk and Lugansk, Zhakarchenko, and Plotinsky, and the foiled terror plots in Crimea. Events in Ukraine are closely tied in with events in Syria. As I realized back in 2014, the whole Maidan coup in Ukraine was revenge for Russia preventing Obama from attacking Syria in the fall of 2013 after the "rebels" launched a chemical weapons attack and blamed the Syrian government. Russia sent its fleet to face down the potential attack, Putin authorizing his commanders to unleash a nuclear war if necessary and supposedly even shooting down two cruise missiles launched by the US navy towards Syria. It was at this moment that cold war 2.0 went into high gear . This despite the face-saving deal in which Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons despite being innocent of the attack. The neocons launched the Maidan coup in revenge, as has since been confirmed by Robert Parry. Since then whenever the empire met defeat in one of these countries it redoubled its efforts in the other. Motorola's death was revenge for the impending victory in Aleppo. This victory seems to be driving the empire of chaos absolutely mad with rage and in truth the survival of the world may depend on the people mobilizing to stop Hillary from starting a nuclear war with Russia over Syria or Ukraine. One hopes they are bluffing but the crazy rhetoric coming out of Washington these days suggests that the ruling class have completely lost their minds and seem to think nuclear war is just another "cakewalk" like the disastrous invasion of Iraq. Thankfully the Russians refused to give in to nuclear blackmail and other than a lacklustre "pause" in Aleppo to attempt to allow civilians to flee and the terrorists to escape, things have been looking ever bleaker for the NATO death squads. I'll briefly describe the situation based on a recent analysis by Canthama at Syrian Perspective. The SAA have been making slow but steady progress across the country. In Northern Hama they are reversing the gains made by the terrorist counteroffensive launched there in a failed attempt to distract the SAA from the battle of Aleppo. The terrorists have suffered heavy losses while being pushed back. In Western Ghouta recent SAA gains in Khan al Shaykh threaten to cut the terrorists off from a nearby town. In East Ghouta the terrorists are suffering heavy losses in their doomed attempt to defend Al Rayham vital for keeping their supply routes open. In Southwestern Aleppo the liberation of the air defense battalion by the SAA and their advance into the Tal Balazul and Tal Mahaba hills threaten to cut off the supply routes to the 1070 Apartments. In eastern Aleppo a 3-pronged offensive continues to liberate the area bit by bit. In other words for the moment the war is going well. We will have to see what schemes the empire concocts in order to try to reverse these steady gains. One major danger is the ever-expanding Turkish invasion in northern Syria and unfortunately Russia and Syria will probably come to regret not moving to stop the Turks from the start. This Turkish-controlled area could well be used in the long-running scheme to establish a no-fly zone in the north of Syria. Rumor also has it that the terrorists in Aleppo are hoping to be rescued by a Turkish offensive. In addition the US is using its Mosul campaign to herd ISIS into eastern Syria where they hope to use them to attack Deir Ezzor, and Palmyra and eventually attempt to turn eastern Syria into a Wahhabi terrorist state. The war in Syria will continue. We can only hope that one day the country will be fully liberated and at peace but unfortunately with Hillary heading for the White House the war will probably continue to intensify. As for Motorola we mourn with the people of Donbass over their fallen hero. Zakharchenko has sworn to take his revenge on Ukraine's SBU and even promised to take back Slavyansk one day in Motorola's honor. Donetsk has lost a brave and charismatic commander but his death will serve as a warning to prepare for renewed war. Like Mozgovoi before him we will never forget Arsen Pavlov: Motorola. Sources A special thanks to @NovaShpakova for advice and inspiration I recently read Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton by Diana Johnstone. The book is a must read. It catalogs Clinton's disastrous foreign policy record and her dangerous advisers. It also provides a brilliant analysis of the past 25 years of Imperial history. With the war in Ukraine heating up let me recommend Slavyangrad to my newer readers as a great English language site on Ukraine. A great tribute to Motorola from a journalist who knew him Igor Strelkov on Motorola

In March we wrote: Reading About Zika May Hurt Your Brain . We listed 35 sensational "news" headlines about potential catastrophes related to a Zika epidemic. The common factor of those panic creating media wave - all those headlines included the miraculous little word may . The pieces were pure speculations with some quoting this or that "expert" who was hunting for research funds or lobbying for some pharmaceutical or pesticide conglomerate. In June we added: Zika Virus Does Not Cause Birth Defects - Fighting It Probably Does . New serious research found what some people in Brazil had suspected from the very start of the small and strictly locally limited jump in microencephaly cases in Brazil: [D]octors in the Zika affected areas in Brazil pointed out that the real cause of somewhat increased microcephaly in the region was probably the insecticide pyriproxyfen, used to kill mosquito larvae in drinking water: The Brazilian doctors noted that the areas of northeast Brazil that had witnessed the greatest number of microcephaly cases match with areas where pyriproxyfen is added to drinking water in an effort to combat Zika-carrying mosquitoes . Pyriproxyfen is reported to cause malformations in mosquito larvae, and has been added to drinking water in the region for the past 18 months. Pyriproxyfen is produced by a Sumitomo Chemical - an important Japanese poison giant. It was therefore unsurprising that the New York Times and others called the Brazilian doctors' report a "conspiracy theory" and trotted out some "experts" to debunk it. ... But [s]cientist at the New England Complex Systems Institute also researched the pyriproxyfen thesis. They found : Pyriproxifen is an analog of juvenile hormone, which corresponds in mammals to regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development causes microcephaly . ... [T]ests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer, Sumitomo, widely quoted as giving no evidence for developmental toxicity, actually found some evidence for such an effect , including low brain mass and arhinencephaly—incomplete formation of the anterior cerebral hemispheres—in rat pups. Finally, the pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is unprecedented—it has never before been applied to a water supply on such a scale. ... Given this combination of information we strongly recommend that the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended pending further investigation. Today the Washington Post finally admits that the Zika virus does not cause birth defects: [T]o the great bewilderment of scientists, the epidemic has not produced the wave of fetal deformities so widely feared when the images of misshapen infants first emerged from Brazil. Instead, Zika has left a puzzling and distinctly uneven pattern of damage across the Americas. According to the latest U.N. figures, of the 2,175 babies born in the past year with undersize heads or other congenital neurological damage linked to Zika, more than 75 percent have been clustered in a single region: northeastern Brazil. The wide areas where the flue virus occurred outside of the small area in Brazil saw no increase in birth defect numbers. The number of (naturally occurring) microcephality cases stayed constant despite a very large increase in (harmless) Zika virus infections. The numbers in Brazil also turned out to be partially inflated because of a lack of standard diagnosis criteria and unreliable statistics. A factor we had pointed to in our very first piece. The WaPo piece today muses about several "possible" causes for the local increase in cases in northeastern Brazil that indeed happened. It quotes some of the very "experts", like from the pharmaceutical industry influenced CDC, that were wrong on the issue since the very first panic headline. It strenuously avoids to even mention the most likely cause - the excessive local use of an insecticide that is supposed to cause birth defects - in developing mosquitoes. Thus the reporting is still void of journalistic ethics and irresponsible in its conclusions. It did not take much effort to get this right. An hour or two of skimming through publicly available sources of good standing, some basic higher education and sound reasoning was enough. But instead of doing such basic inquiries "journalists" and media "served" panic and speculations by biased "experts". Keep this story in mind for the next sensationalist onslaught of panic headline. There surely will be some "interests" behind those; just don't expect unbiased facts and basic logic reasoning. Comment: And Zika -- like Ebola, SARS, bird flu, West Nile, etc. -- will fall down the memory hole...until the next scare comes along.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 00:00 UTC Triggered journalists from across the nation are bemoaning the treatment members of the press are receiving at Trump campaign rallies from the Trump supporters the media routinely misrepresents as ignorant racists, fascist Nazis, or disenchanted working whites. With increasing regularity, these journalist snowflakes are "reporting" their victimization at the hands Trump supporters who chant mean things like, "CNN sucks" and call them names like "presstitutes." For members of the media elite, the occasional taunts and jeers signal a dangerous threat to the free press. During an interview with Kellyanne Conway on Tuesday, CNN's Wolf Blitzer breathlessly asked Trump's campaign manager to ask Trump to stop calling out the press at his rallies because he is scared "there could be an ugly incident" between Trump supporters and the "hardworking young journalists" who cover his rallies. A quick review of media stories over the last two weeks reveals more than a dozen articles in major publications with the same "journalists victimized by Trump supporters at rallies" narrative. Trump supporters endure long waits, messy parking, and often obstructed view seating to rally for their candidate. The press, on the other hand, is given their own entrance, sectioned off seating, and protection from event security and the Secret Service. After an exhaustive search, this Breitbart reporter could find exactly zero incidences of members of the media being physically attacked or assaulted at Trump rallies. None of this has stopped the misleading characterization of Trump supporters creating a "menacing" and "dangerous" environment for these special snowflakes. The narrative sprung up briefly in August when NBC 's Katy Tur wrote a long piece in Marie Claire in which she gives her account of her confrontational relationship with Trump and the backlash his "insults" on her reporting created with his supporters. Here is a small piece from her "no-holds-barred" account: I was six months into covering the Trump campaign for MSNBC and NBC News, and there I was, in the belly of a World War II battleship, in a press pen made out of bicycle racks, surrounded by thousands of whipped-up Trump supporters. ... Trump decided to go further in Mount Pleasant, pointing his finger squarely at me and launching a personal attack as millions of Americans watched at home. "What a lie it was," Trump said, referring to the claim that he had left the stage abruptly. "What a lie. Katy Tur. What a lie it was. Third. Rate. Reporter. Remember that." The crowd's boos ricocheted off the iron hull of the USS Yorktown. Just a few days after the Tur piece was published, two other NBC press employees — Frank Thorp and Ali Vitali — tweeted out pictures and videos of Trump supporters showing insufficient deference to the press. It was so very traumatic that it inspired several stories, including this one in Real Clear Politics . On October 13th, the victimhood narrative kicked off in earnest when the "Committee to Protect Journalists" issued a statement claiming that Donald Trump is a "threat to press freedom." The same day Politico's Ben Schreckinger ran an article titled, "Trump crowds rain hate on the press" and CNN 's Jim Acosta claimed to have found a crudely written sign with a swastika and "media" written on it. The next day, on October 14th, the narrative of violent Trump supporters scaring the press was being pushed across the media . The Huffington Post 's Ed Mazza wrote a piece titled, "Frenzied Donald Trump Supporters Are Turning On The Media — And It's Getting Scary." The Washington Post 's Paul Farhi wrote , "The press always got booed at Trump rallies. But now the aggression is menacing." Ed Kilgore at New York Magazine titled his piece, "Trump's Dangerous Game of 'Beat the Press'." Tierney Mcafee 's article in People Magazine was titled, "Press Corps with Trump Now Needs Police Escort as Crowd Shouts 'Whores!'." Even the Wall St. Journal got in on the action when Reid Epstein wrote, "Trump Rally-Goers Dismiss His Vulgarities, Offer Their Own for Clinton, News Media." Just to name a few. The stories have continued until the time of this writing with similar articles in the New York Times , Media Matters , Washington Post (again), AlterNet , and on and on. Every special snowflake reporter with a Twitter account wanted in on the sweet victimhood action. McKay Coppins from Buzzfeed tweeted a seven-second video of someone "heckling reporters." Jose DelReal from the Washington Post tweeted that the "vitriol towards the media" was as bad as he has ever seen with the "boos and cursing and middle fingers." Poor little guy, Eric Boehlert from Media Matters didn't get his own video so he compiled several from other reporters for his own breathless article. Frank Thorp tweeted video of people chanting "CNN sucks." The horror! Rosie Gray , another Buzzfeed reporter, found a new angle to keep the narrative going when an attendee used the term Lugenpresse, a German term for "lying press." You know who else used the German term Lugenpresse? The Nazi's. As CNN 's Jake Tapper pointed out. CNN 's Jim Acosta wanted everyone to know just how hard it is to do a live shot when people are yelling at you. After weeks of nonstop reporting about the "menacing" and "scary" treatment of reporters at the hands of Trump supporters, one of the most regular victims, Sopan Deb from CBS, got a nice note from a do-gooding White Knight. At a rally in Naples Florida recently, Trump supporters heckled the press for refusing to stand for the national anthem and pledge of allegiance. Dustin Stockton is a political reporter for Breitbart News, a community liaison for Gun Owners of America, and a political strategist.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 15:50 UTC © yelp.com Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center. Three Philadelphia prison guards are facing charges including aggravated assault after allegedly beating up a handcuffed inmate and submitting a fraudulent report. They say the inmate harmed himself, but their actions were caught on video. Milton Gibbs, 52, Terrance Bailey, 30, and Shaun Lowe, 26, are facing charges of aggravated assault, conspiracy, and tampering with public records. There are also additional charges of misdemeanor, recklessly endangering another person, unsworn falsification to authorities, and obstructing the administration of law and official oppression. They turned themselves in for arrest on Wednesday. "We cannot stand for any kind of assault, and this attack on a handcuffed inmate by sworn corrections officers is egregious. Every inmate who is held in our prisons deserves to be treated with dignity and respect," Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said in statement following arrests of the three guards. According to the investigation, the assault at the Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center dates back to June, when Gibbs allegedly threatened inmate Brandon Kulb, 22, stating that he would "hang him and murder him." It is alleged that Gibbs called Bailey, and the two then entered Kulb's cell and began beating, kicking, and spitting on him. District Attorney Williams says they eventually put Kulb in handcuffs and walked him down a staircase, while continuing to beat him. "Once they arrived at the cell block's exit, Bailey struck the victim in the back of the head knocking him to the ground. Gibbs and Bailey then dragged the victim into the central control area and began to stomp on him. Lowe arrived on scene and joined in the assault," the DA's office said in a press release, adding that Kulb "lost consciousness" at least twice during that time. The guards tried to make sure that the assault would not get captured on surveillance cameras, but "much" of it was still caught on CCTV, offering the investigation irrefutable evidence. Despite that, guards tried to cover up the assault. After the purported beating of Kulb, Gibbs and Bailey submitted a mental health referral saying the inmate had intentionally harmed himself. Lowe allegedly transported the victim to the receiving room, and Gibbs tried to coerce the victim not to report the incident in exchange for food from the staff kitchen, the DA said. In their reports, the three wrote that they only used "open hand" control, because they had to subdue Kulb. They omitted their own actions. This is not the first time Gibbs has been arrested, according to NewsWorks. In 2004, he was reportedly fired for assaulting an inmate but was acquitted in a federal civil rights case filed against him.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 15:45 UTC © Lockheed An artist's illustration of a Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellite in orbit. A third U.S. Air Force weather satellite that launched more than 20 years ago has broken up in orbit, Air Force Space Command disclosed Monday evening. Air Force officials confirmed the breakup of the long-retired Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Flight 12 satellite (DMSP F-12) after the Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, detected an additional object orbiting alongside the 22-year-old satellite . DMSP F-12, which the Air Force retired from service in 2008, had the same battery assembly that was implicated in the February 2015 breakup of DMSP F-13. While both satellites were built by Lockheed Martin and launched less than a year apart, DMSP F-13 was still in service when it suffered its breakup, producing nearly 150 pieces of debris . DMSP F-12, in contrast, was shut down in 2008 — a process that entails burning off the satellite's remaining fuel, releasing compressed gasses, and discharging the battery. The Air Force said Monday evening it was tracking just one piece of debris associated with DMSP F-12's breakup. Properly shutting down a DMSP satellite at the end of its service life is no guarantee that it won't suffer a catastrophic breakup, however. In 2004, a 13-year-old DMSP spacecraft, dubbed DMSP-F11, broke apart and produced 56 pieces of cataloged space debris, even though it had been taken out of service and gone through the normal end-of-life showdown procedures . Following the February 2015 breakup of DMSP F-13 , the Air Force said a total of nine DMSP satellites launched between 1982 and 1997 all had the same failure-prone battery assembly. At the time, only seven were still in orbit. With the breakup of DMSP F-12, that number is down to six. Of those, only one — DMSP F-14 — is still in service. The Air Force said determining the cause of DMSP F-12's breakup will be especially difficult since they have no telemetry from the long-silent satellite to help assess the incident. The Air Force still has five DMSP satellites in service. The youngest, DMSP F-18, was launched in 2009. The oldest, DMSP F-14, was launched in 1997. In February, the DMSP suffered another setback when the Air Force lost the ability to command DMSP F-19 due to an onboard power failure. The satellite had been in orbit less than two years when the failure occurred. Comment: Are these satellites just falling to pieces because of bad design? Is someone using them as target practice? Or are some of them falling victim to the increase in space rocks penetrating our skies? (For example: Space rock collision? USAF satellite explodes in Earth orbit ) What exactly are these satellites used for? From Lockheed : Today, DMSP is still providing strategic and tactical weather prediction to aid the U.S. military in planning operations at sea, on land and in the air . The satellites, equipped with a sophisticated sensor suite, can: Image visible and infrared cloud cover Measure precipitation, surface temperature, and soil moisture Collect specialized global meteorological, oceanographic, and solar-geophysical information in all weather conditions

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 15:47 UTC © Getty A total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military build up on Russia's borders since the Cold War. Britain is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russia's borders as part of a huge military deployment. A total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia next spring, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said. The move is part of the biggest military build up of NATO troops on Russia's borders since the Cold War . © REX Mr Fallon said the deployment of the battalion, supported by French and Danish troops, will start from May 2017. "Although we are leaving the European Union, we will be doing more to help secure the eastern and southern flanks of NATO," Mr Fallon said. London is also sending Typhoon fighter aircraft to Romania to patrol around the Black Sea, partly in support of Turkey. It comes after an increase in tensions between the West and Russia in recent months. Earlier this month, 40 million Russians reportedly carried out nuclear evacuation tests after officials warned that the West wanted to launch strikes on the country. NATO is now pressing allies including the US and Britain to contribute to the military presence as the alliance prepares for a long quarrel with Moscow. Last week, a Russian aircraft carrier passed through the English Channel as it traveled to Syria in a show of force along Europe's shores. Alliance defense ministers aim to make good on a July promise by NATO leaders to send forces to the Baltic states and eastern Poland from early next year. The United States hopes for binding commitments from Europe to fill four battle groups of some 4,000 troops, part of NATO's response to Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and concern it could try a similar tactic in Europe's ex-Soviet states. Comment: This propaganda still lives despite Russia showing no interest invading any country. France, Denmark, Italy and other allies are expected to join the four battle groups led by the United States, Germany, Britain and Canada to go to Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, with forces ranging from armored infantry to drones. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the commitments would be "a clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond." Diplomats said it would also send a message to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has complained that European allies do not pay their way in the alliance. The battle groups will be backed by NATO's 40,000-strong rapid-reaction force, and if need be, further follow-on forces, for any potential conflict, which could move into Baltic states and Poland on rotation. The strategy is part of an emerging new deterrent that could eventually be combined with missile defenses, air patrols and defenses against cyber attacks. However, the alliance is still struggling for a similar strategy in the Black Sea region, which Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said is becoming a "Russian lake" because of Moscow's military presence there. Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey are expected to soon come forward with a plan to increase naval and air patrols in the area, as well as a multinational NATO brigade in Romania. For the Kremlin, the U.S.-led alliance's plans are already too much given Russia's grievances at NATO's expansion eastwards. Stoltenberg denied going too far. "This is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict." Comment: Stoltenberg's thinking is flawed since moving troops to a country's border based on no threats is an act of aggression that promotes conflict. Next year's deployments have taken on greater symbolism since Russia pulled out of several nuclear disarmament agreements in the past two months while moving nuclear-capable missiles into its Baltic exclave in Kaliningrad. The so-called Iskander-M cruise missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. "This deployment, if it becomes permanent, if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in (Russia's) security posture," the United States' envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute, said. Tensions have been building since Crimea and the West's decision to impose retaliatory sanctions, but the breakdown of a U.S-Russia brokered ceasefire in Syria on October 3, followed by U.S. accusations that Russia has used cyber attacks to disrupt the presidential election, have signaled a sharp worsening of East-West relations. EU leaders met last week to consider fresh sanctions over Russian bombing of civilian areas in Aleppo and NATO's Stoltenberg said he fears the Russian warships heading to the Mediterranean could launch new attacks on the Syrian city. Even before the break down of the Syrian ceasefire, Russian President Vladimir Putin suspended a treaty with Washington on cleaning up weapons-grade plutonium, signalling he was willing to use nuclear disarmament as a new bargaining chip in disputes with the United States over Ukraine and Syria.

Wed, 26 Oct 2016 16:06 UTC © podesta.com Because there's no job like being an agent for a country that kills Christians, gays, critics of the government, treats women like dirt, massacres thousands of foreigners, and funds terrorists. Good job, Tony! Tony Podesta — brother of the now-disgraced Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, whose files Wikileaks has been publishing — is not only a powerful Democratic Party lobbyist, but a registered foreign agent receiving a hefty monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of Saudi Arabia. No — as tinfoil-hat conspiracy theorist as it might sound — that scenario is the absolute truth. In 1988, John and Tony Podesta formed the Podesta Group and have used their bigwig party-insider status to lobby and influence government policies — while, at various times, simultaneously holding positions of power — which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest . According to the March 2016 filing made in accordance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, Tony Podesta is an active foreign agent of the Saudi government with the "Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court," and acts as an officer of the Saudi Arabia account. At this point, the web of pay-for-play between the Washington, political heavyweights, and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight. For starters, the Podesta brothers' lobbying firm receives $140,000 every month from the Saudi government , which, in no uncertain terms — and despite a status as privileged U.S. ally — wages a bloody campaign of censorship, murder, suppression, human rights abuse, and worse against its civilian population, while bombing hospitals, schools, and aid convoys in neighboring nations. John Podesta previously served as President Bill Clinton's chief of staff, founded the think tank Center for American Progress ( which oh-so-coincidentally touts the need to reframe Saudi Arabia's hopelessly tarnished image ), counseled President Obama, and now chairs Hillary Clinton's campaign. Tony Podesta acts as a foreign agent for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia — lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the Kingdom — while also contributing to and bundling for Hillary Clinton's campaign. Think about that for a moment. One brother uses the influence of money to both affect United States foreign policy and infuse the Clinton campaign with cash — while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities. As the Washington Post reported months ago in July, Tony Podesta's lobbying efforts "raised $268,000 for the campaign and $31,000 for the victory fund." "The Saudis hired the Podesta Group in 2015 because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in Yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home, including sentencing blogger Raif Badawi to ten years in prison and 1,000 lashes for 'insulting Islam,'" Alternet reported . "Since then, Tony Podesta's fingerprints have been all over Saudi Arabia's advocacy efforts in Washington DC. When Saudi Arabia executed the prominent nonviolent Shia dissident Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, causing protests throughout the Shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions, The New York Times noted that the Podesta Group provided the newspaper with a Saudi commentator who defended the execution." Comment: Think about that for a moment. Notably, the Saudis' reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up — concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year, but suspiciously reckless and errant U.S.-backed coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict. Additionally, Tony Podesta's status as a registered foreign agent for Saudi Arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from April 15, 2015 — ironically revealed by Wikileaks' publishing of his brothers personal communiques — in which former Clinton Foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director Dennis Cheng wrote to a small group of insiders: "Hi all - we do need to make a decision on this ASAP as our friends who happen to be registered with FARA [Foreign Agents Registration Act] are already donating and raising. "I do want to push back a bit (it's my job!): I feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table (both for primary and general, and then DNC and state parties)... and how do we explain to people that we'll take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them; that the Foundation takes $ from foreign govts but we now won't. Either way, we need to make a decision soon." To which general counsel to the Clinton campaign, attorney Marc Elias, replied [all errors original and emphasis added], "Responding to all on this. I was not on the call this morning, but I lean away from a bright line rule here. It seems odd to say that someone who represents Alberta, Canada can't give, but a lobbyist for Phillip Morris can. Just as we vet lobbyists case by case, I would do the same with FARA. While this may lead to a large number of FARA registrants being denied, it would not be a flat our ban. A total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eye-rolling and ill will that it did for Obama." As the exchange continues, how to precisely handle the campaign's image with potentially controversial donors — while, at all costs, maintaining the flow of cash — becomes even more apparent. As strategist and campaign manager Robby Mook responds, "Where do we draw the line though?" Elias suggests a particularly intricate solution: "If we do it case by case, then it will be subjective. We would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for. In judging whether to take the money, we would consider the relationship between that country and the United States, its relationship to the State Department during Hillary's time as Secretary, and its relationship, if any, to the Foundation . In judging the individual, we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and Hillary's past campaigns specifically. "Put simply, we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists, except with a somewhat more stringent screen. "As a legal matter, I am not saying we have to do this - we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely. I'm just offering this up as a middle ground." Mook eventually decides plainly, "Marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions don't really get you anything...that Obama actually got judged MORE harshly as a result. He convinced me. So...in a complete U-turn, I'm ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks . Are you guys ok with that?" All of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect — despite increasing calls for the United States to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody Saudi regime — the U.S. approved a stunning $1.29 billion sale of smart bombs to the Kingdom in November 2015. Tony Podesta's specific contract with the government-run Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court, which will earn $1.68 million by year's end, does, indeed, suggest the infusion of a pro-Saudi message into the U.S. media propaganda machine . "Saudi Arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in Washington," Sunlight Foundation spokesman Josh Stewart told the Washington Post . "That spans both what you'd call the inside game, which is lobbying and government relations, and the outside game, which is PR and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying." That broader audience — the American public — has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughly-corrupt Clinton campaign if not surreptitiously by the Saudis, as well. As The Free Thought Project has repeatedly reported , the evidence of collusion among the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton's campaign, and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable — including no less than 65 so-called journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign. Although this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet. And yet, at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the White House — who will not be held responsible for any number of questionable and criminal acts. The system isn't rigged — it's performing exactly as intended — and always will as long as the vote validates its existence. Comment: More from the Podesta front:

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 15:56 UTC © Brian Snyder / Reuters John Podesta WikiLeaks has released a 20th batch of emails from the account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chair. The issues discussed include Bill Clinton's past, Benghazi, the email server scandal and even alien life. The whistleblowing site has promised to release 50,000 messages from Podesta in the lead up to the US presidential election on November 8. A total of 34,197 communications have been released to date. Bill's past Bill Clinton's controversial past was evidently of concern to his wife's campaign team, which discussed how to handle questions on allegations of sexual assault against him. Preparation for what the media might throw at her included the questions: "Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?" and "How is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did?" The mail was sent by Ron Klain, a member of Clinton's debate preparation team, on January 12, 2016. Several days previous Paula Jones, one of Bill Clinton's accusers, gave an interview calling Hillary Clinton a"liar" and "two-faced" for trying to discredit her husband's accusers. Let's hope the Democratic party is not suicidal A July 2015 email from Clinton adviser Neera Tanden to Podesta discusses a CNN poll which she guesses will show, "Bernie doing pretty well w Hillary and doing as well against Jeb or close to it." "Can you imagine what Republicans would do with him if he were the nominee?" Podesta replies, referring to Sanders. "Well, let's see what the poll actually says. Let's hope the Democratic party is not suicidal," Tanden says. "Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email?" she asks. "And has that person been drawn and quartered?" "Like whole thing is f*cking insane," she adds. Downplaying Benghazi An October 2015 email chain between staffers discusses upcoming paid media ads about Benghazi and Clinton's email scandal. The group debates whether the ads should target Iowa and New Hampshire or be a national buy. "I know the boss wants a national cable buy to reach the inside the beltway types, press and donors," Jennifer Palmieri says. "But press will hate this." Oren Shur replies, "If the objective is purely to undermine the Benghazi hearings, I think these spots will certainly help do that. But if the objective is to connect emails-Benghazi and conflate the two in voters' minds (which consultants feel is an imperative here), I'm not sure we know whether we can credibly do that." The campaign appears to have decided to do a national ad on the subject. Small tweaks A March 2016 email chain discussing Clinton's inaccurate statement about the late Nancy Reagan starting a national conversation about AIDS, when she did the opposite, reveals Clinton's unwillingness to admit mistakes, even when she is proven to be wrong. The subject of the meeting is described as "the difference between our contiguous universe nonviolent ETI and the celestials in our own universe." The team go back on forth on Clinton's statement about the issue. "YESTERDAY I MADE A MISTAKE IN SPEAKING ABOUT NANCY REAGAN'S record on HIV AND AIDS," it begins. "I think the chances of her OK-ing this statement with that top are slim," Megan Rooney says. "Here is a revised draft of a statement. It does include the words 'I made a mistake' in the first line," Rooney says. "We need a strategy for getting her to approve this. I don't know if that means someone who is traveling with her (Maya?) making the case... or something else." A later draft was then sent, changing it to, "I said something inaccurate when speaking about the Reagan's' record on HIV and AIDS." "The Secretary approved the statement, with small tweaks," Rooney says. Extraterrestrial disclosure Former astronaut Edgar Mitchell, known for his correspondence with Podesta regarding extraterrestrials, emails Podesta regarding the "Phoenix Lights" incident in 1997, in which thousands of people reported sightings of hovering lights in the sky. Mitchell "was on the phone just as they were happening over Phoenix with an eyewitness describing on March 13, 1997. This incentives about disclosure, while other reports like Roswell disincentives," according to the mail from April 2015. The subject of extraterrestrial disclosure is "now more important than ever" according to another mail sent on Mitchell's behalf a month later. "It is also imperative that after your talk with Edgar, he then speak directly with President Obama via Skype for historical purposes, about the same issue, while the President is still in office," Podesta is told.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 16:08 UTC © Thaier Al-Sudan / Reuters Smoke rises from a sulfur factory after Islamic militants set fire to it releasing toxic smoke over the area at south of Mosul, Iraq, October 21, 2016. A sulfur mine and stockpile set ablaze by Islamic State terrorists has produced a huge toxic residue cloud, along with some apocalyptic scenery. The fire, set near Mosul, was aimed at slowing down Iraqi troops attempting to retake the city. The Al-Mishraq sulfur plant and mine were set on fire last Thursday, Iraqi commander Qusay Hamid Kadhem told AFP. At least two civilians in nearby villages have reportedly been killed from sulfur dioxide exposure, and 1,000 others have been treated for breathing problems. Comment: Mishraq: ISIS torches sulphur plant, 1,000 suffer breathing problems According to scientists, the sulfur dioxide emission is "significant" and alarming. The large sulfur dioxide cloud has been spotted by The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA's Aura spacecraft and the Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS) on Suomi NPP. It has been seen spreading cross northern and central Iraq. The sulfur dioxide emission is comparable to what typically takes place during a large volcanic eruption. The same sulfur field was on fire for one month in 2003, with scientists estimating that 21 kilotons of toxic sulfur dioxide were emitted daily during that time period. "After nearly a month of burning, the 2003 fire had released roughly 600 kilotons of sulfur dioxide - so much that it was the largest non-volcanic release of sulfur dioxide we had ever observed with satellites," said Nikolay Krotkov, an atmospheric scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 16:19 UTC © Khaled Abdullah / Reuters UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson claims if Britain did not sell arms to Saudi Arabia, other countries "would happily" take over the market. Johnson insisted the government is closely monitoring the situation in Yemen, where Saudi forces have been accused of war crimes over the course of their 19-month military intervention. He said boycotting the sale of arms to Riyadh would harm British interests in the region and diminish its diplomatic and political influence. Labour's Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry has called for an independent UN-led investigation into allegations of war crimes in Yemen, and the suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia while the inquiry takes place. Speaking in Parliament, Johnson said the Saudi government should conduct its own investigation first. "The Saudi government has approached this matter with great seriousness, and the seriousness it deserves," he said. "But the House should be in no doubt that we in this country are monitoring the situation minutely and meticulously, and will continue to apply our established criteria for granting licences with fairness and rigour, and in full accordance with UK law." Comment: And the UN must also be confident of Saudi Arabia's good intention by allowing a seat on the UNHRC board: What's wrong with the planet? Saudi Arabia to be reelected to UN Human Rights Council The Foreign Secretary added that other countries would "happily supply" weapons to the Gulf kingdom if the UK boycotted exports. "To those who say, as apparently they now do in this motion, that we should simply disregard those legal procedures, be in no doubt that we would be vacating a space that would rapidly be filled by other Western countries who would happily supply arms with nothing like the same compunctions or criteria or respect for humanitarian law. "And more importantly, we would at a stroke eliminate this country's positive ability to exercise our moderating, diplomatic and political influence on a crisis where there are massive UK interests at stake. " Comment: Boris means military industrial interests. A parliamentary motion calling for a boycott of arms to Saudi Arabia and an independent UN investigation was defeated in the House of Commons after more than 100 Labour MPs on the party's right wing failed to support it. MP John Woodcock defended Britain's role in arming and training the Saudi military as it carries out airstrikes in Yemen. "The coalition is precisely focused on training Saudis to be better able to be in compliance with international humanitarian law so that our interventions, if effective, will create fewer civilian casualties," he said. MP Toby Perkins said he could not back the motion because Britain has "significant economic interest in continuing to have positive relations with the Saudis." Comment: This is like saying it is better to be a war criminal and make money than forgo the money and not be a participant of war crimes. The damage has already been committed so why stop now?

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 16:45 UTC © Yves Herman / Reuters The Belgian government has reached a deal with the Wallonia region on the free trade agreement between the European Union and Canada, according to Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel. Michel said "an agreement" was found after a last minute round of negotiations with Belgium's French-speaking community who have been holding up the deal. Brussels has not released the details of the compromise. The signing of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) was cancelled on Thursday after the deal was blocked by Wallonia's regional parliament. Comment: Belgium's Wallonia region defying EU Junker's CETA trade deal Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was forced to cancel Thursday's trip to Brussels as the negotiations had stalled. Wallonia premier Paul Magnette said the region was not opposed to an EU trade deal with Canada. However, he insisted the secret arbitration scheme allowing corporations to sue governments had to be dropped from the agreement. Regional leaders in Wallonia voted 46 to 16 against CETA over fears of job losses due to cheaper farming and industrial imports. CETA promises to eliminate tariffs on 98 percent of goods immediately after ratification and also encompasses regulatory cooperation, shipping, sustainable development and access to government tenders. CETA's supporters say the deal would yield billions in added trade through customs and tariff cuts and other measures facilitating business ties. Opponents claim the trade deal will only benefit the wealthy and large corporations. For CETA to be ratified, all 28 European Union countries have to agree the treaty. Until now, Belgium has been the main obstacle to the free trade deal. "All parliaments are now able to approve by tomorrow at midnight. Important step for EU and Canada," Michel tweeted.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 16:35 UTC © UPI.com Successful eurobond sale in September, credit upgrade by Fitch, and sharp improvement in World Bank Ease of Doing Business ranking, all confirm effectiveness of Russian government's economic policies, amidst strengthening recovery. As economic recovery in Russia continues to gain hold, Russia has received authoritative endorsement both for its successful macroeconomic policies and for its rapidly improving business conditions. The US credit rating agency Fitch on 14th October 2016 upgraded Russia's rating from BBB- (negative) to BBB- (stable). Normally I pay no attention to ratings decisions by US credit rating agencies, which have been proved repeatedly wrong, and which in Russia's case are blatantly politicised. Back in 2015, during the worst period of the recession, I pointed out how obviously and completely wrong the decisions of the US credit rating agencies to downgrade Russia's credit rating at that time were. The market clearly agrees with me. Fitch's Russia rating is only just investment grade, whilst those of S&P and Moody's actually give Russia a junk rating. In spite of this - and as I predicted - Russia's last eurobond issue in September was six times oversubscribed, with almost the entirety of the issue on this occasion sold to US investors . Even the Western financial media has been finally forced to admit that Russia's latest eurobond issue was a success . If I refer to Fitch's latest upgrade of Russia's rating, it is not because I agree with Fitch's rating of Russia (I don't) but because of what Fitch has to say about Russia's economic policy "Russia has implemented a coherent and credible policy response to the sharp fall in oil prices. A flexible exchange rate, inflation targeting, fiscal consolidation and financial sector support have allowed the economy to adjust and domestic confidence to return gradually. The strength and quality of the policy response stands out relative to those of other oil producers similarly affected by the oil price shock. (bold italics added) In other words Russia has responded to the oil price fall intelligently and successfully - more so than have the other oil producers. In his State of the Union address of 20th January 2015 US President Obama famously gloated "today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated with its economy in tatters." Judging by the success of its latest eurobond issue, and the credit upgrade Russia has just been given by Fitch, neither the market nor even Fitch agree with him. Meanwhile Russia's World Bank Ease of Doing Business ranking continues its rapid rise. In 2011 Russia's ranking was 123 in the survey out of 183. By 2014 it had risen to 62 out of 189, by 2015 to 51 out of 189, and in this year's survey it has risen again to 40 out of 190. When I discussed last year's survey I made the point that the dramatic improvement in Russia's World Bank Ease of Doing Business ranking is simply incompatible with Russia being the corrupt kleptocracy of the West's imagination "In corrupt kleptocratic oligarchies courts do not function efficiently, contracts are not performed and enforced, rights of minority shareholders are not protected, and people are not able to register their property easily and do not pay their taxes." Comment: Putin's record for fighting corruption is world-class but the Western media will never tell you I also pointed out that the rapid improvement of Russia's World Bank Ease of Doing Business ranking proves that the claim that Russia is not "reforming" its economy is quite simply wrong. Russia is not only continuously reforming its economy, but it is doing so successfully " the demand for more and more "reforms" simply ignores the fact that reforms are in fact being carried out. Anyone who reads through the World Bank's annual surveys will see that they are all about "reforms". It is precisely because Russia is carrying out "reforms" that its ranking is rising so fast. To be clear, modernising the court system, introducing a new bankruptcy law, simplifying procedures for connecting to the electricity supply, and passing laws on registering property and on administering bankruptcy, are reforms. They may lack the drama of breaking up Gazprom, but academic research, historical experience and the World Bank all say the same thing: it is these sort of unexciting reforms that in the end are the ones that make a difference and which produce results. In other words Russia is reforming, and it is doing so successfully, in a methodical and purposeful way. Doing so requires hard work and unremitting attention to detail. The Russian authorities deserve credit for successfully doing it, not the criticism for doing nothing that they normally get." I also made an extended point about what Russia's ranking in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business survey says about the overall level of Russia's society and economy. The continued advance in Russia's ranking to 40th in the world shows that this point remains valid, so I reproduce it here in full "The second point is that if one looks at what sort of countries now outrank Russia in the survey, it turns out that they are - broadly speaking - the three Asian industrial giants: Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, the two Asian city states of Hong Kong and Singapore, and the traditional and well established industrialised societies of the West: the US, the three rich countries of the British commonwealth (Canada, Australia and New Zealand) and most (though not all) the states of the EU - in sum what was once called "the first world". If one removes the one indicator where Russia scores especially badly, Trading Across Borders - for which there are special reasons (see above) - Russia becomes even more clearly aligned with these "first world" countries rather than with those countries that make up what used to be called "the third world". The Russian government's target is to achieve 20th place in the World Bank's ease of doing business survey by 2018. That may be too optimistic, though it is worth pointing out that the target for this year was 50th, which Russia only missed by one place. If Russia does achieve a ranking of 20th in the world by 2018 then it will be right in the middle of the "first world" group of countries rather than just outside it. At that point it will also have one of the best business climates in the world. Even if Russia does not achieve 20th position by 2018, the pace of improvement in the rankings is so fast it suggests Russia will break in fully in terms of quality of its business climate into the list of "first world" countries before long." Inevitably, as Russia's position in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business survey has rapidly improved, some commentators both in the West and Russia have cast doubt on the survey, even though its methodology is rigorous (originating apparently with Harvard University) and even though it is based on thorough field work. Needless to say these are the same commentators who regularly cited the survey when Russia's ranking in it was poor. There is in fact no reason to think the rapid rise in Russia's position in the survey does not reflect actual business conditions. As I said in my discussion of last year's survey, its results were anecdotally confirmed to me in a meeting I had with a group of local businessmen in Perm. A far more authoritative person has now come forward and said the same thing. This is German Gref, the single individual who is perhaps best informed about conditions for businesses in Russia because he is the CEO of Sberbank, Russia's biggest bank, which is the national (as opposed to local) bank that small businesses in Russia are most likely to look to for credit. Gref stands politically at the farthest liberal end of the spectrum of Russia's political and economic establishment, and he is far from shy about criticising the government, which he does frequently. Yet in a meeting with Putin on 4th August 2016 he confirmed the improvement in business conditions in Russia "I think that the environment that we will have in place by the end of 2016, when all of the legal amendments take effect, will mean that Russia will be offering one of the most interesting and technologically convenient environments for small businesses. " (bold italics added) Because of the extremely poor relations between the West and Russia, Russia's economy and its economic management are continuously and relentlessly criticised in a way which plays well to Western prejudice but which grossly distorts understanding of the country and its government. Russia's highly conservative macroeconomic policies emphasising tight budget discipline (the federal budget deficit at the peak of the recession was 3% of GDP, roughly the same as that of the US and below that of Britain during their 'recoveries', with the Russian government planning to cut the deficit by 1% of GDP over each coming year), low taxes (income tax is levied at a flat rate of 13%), high real interest rates (currently around 4% above inflation), open financial markets, low debt (government debt in Russia is 17.7% of GDP compared to 104% in the US, 229% in Japan, 89% in Britain, 96% in France and 71% in Germany), low external debt (roughly 20% of Russia's GDP, compared to 114% of the US's, 570% of Britain's, 220% of France's, 145% of Germany's and 60% of Japan's) and floating exchange rate, have in reality enabled Russia - as Fitch says - to adjust rapidly and very successfully to the fall in oil prices. At the same time the rapid improvement in business conditions shown by the rapid rise of Russia's ranking in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business survey shows that Russia is also working hard and successfully at getting its microeconomic conditions right. In other words the people who run Russia's economy know their job and by and large they do it well. That does not mean they are infallible. In my opinion interest rates are far too high, with the 4% inflation target for next year in danger of becoming a fetish. However compared to the appalling mismanagement one sees elsewhere, far from being the collapsing kleptocratic empire of Western fancy, Russia looks like an island of stability and good sense.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 17:02 UTC © Daniel Acker-Bloomberg/Getty Images With their candidate lagging in most of the major polls, Donald Trump's supporters are hoping the election holds a surprise akin to June's Brexit vote. Goldman Sachs, though, believes the chances of a Nov. 8 surprise in the U.S. are remote. The two races differ in several key ways , Goldman economist Alec Phillips said, diminishing the possibility of a repeat where polling incorrectly suggested that Britons would vote to stay in the European Union. "We think the situation is different for two reasons. First, and most importantly, while both situations represented an opportunity for voters to endorse a change in the status quo, voters in the U.K. were asked to decide on an idea whereas in the U.S. they are being asked to decide on a person ," Phillips said in a note to clients Wednesday. "Second, the polls are simply not as close in the current presidential contest as they were ahead of the U.K. referendum." On the first point, Phillips obviously is correct. The second, though, isn't as clear. True, some polls have showed a yawning gap between the two candidates. The latest NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll put the Hillary Clinton lead at 11 points , the last ABC tracking poll had the Democrat ahead by 8 and CNN has the advantage at 6 points. However, the Real Clear Politics average of all major polls gives Clinton just a 4.4-point edge, and the Los Angeles Times ' tracker even sees Trump with a 1-point lead. By comparison, the final London Telegraph poll heading into the June 23 vote had the "remain" vote with a comfortable 4-point lead . Betting odds in the U.K. had given "remain" an 88 percent chance of prevailing, against the "leave" victory of 4 points. In his analysis, Phillips noted that The Economist magazine published an average of polls that showed the referendum tied, with a large percentage of undecided voters. He also said polls showing Trump ahead, like the LA Times and Rasmussen, use methodology different from many of the other mainstream outlets (though he concedes that polls showing Clinton with outsize leads also could be outliers). Comment: Translation: the other MSM polls are rigged, e.g., with their tendency to oversample Democrats. Phillips mostly dismisses the importance of third-party voters, whom he said often break toward a major-party candidate as Election Day approaches. "In theory, if undecided voters broke entirely in favor of Mr. Trump on Election Day, this could change the election outcome ," he wrote. "However, the views of undecided and third-party voters suggest that they are more likely to vote for Sec. Clinton than Mr. Trump, if they vote at all." Specifically, he cites a Washington Post poll showing that 46 percent of voters not supporting either Clinton or Trump had a "strongly unfavorable" view of Clinton, against 71 percent for Trump . Finally, he believes Trump won't be aided significantly by stronger-than-expected turnout, while early voting trends don't appear to favor the Republican either. However, Phillips does not address recent polls showing Trump with a solid chance of winning critical swing states Florida and Ohio, or narrowing gaps in Pennsylvania and North Carolina . "Overall, while one cannot rule out the possibility of an electoral surprise, most of the theories as to how this might occur are not borne out by the recently available data," Phillips said. "The declining share of undecided and third-party voters is shrinking, leaving fewer voters left to persuade, and while a shift in turnout could upend the models most pollsters use, there are no signs thus far in early voting that such a shift is occurring and, if anything, recent data suggest a slight Democratic turnout advantage." Wall Street is heavily invested in a Clinton victory. Securities and investment firms have poured nearly $65 million into her campaign coffers, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Goldman Sachs employees have donated $284,816 to Clinton and just $3,641 to Trump, who has received $716,407 from Wall Street. Comment: Two possibilities stand out: 1) The puppet masters have learned their lesson from Brexit. In other words, when rigging an election, don't underestimate the number of people who will actually vote the 'wrong' way. If you think you can swing 10% of the vote in your favor when you need 20-30%, you're going to fail, leading to an unexpected and undesired outbreak of actual democracy. 2) Goldman Sachs is just as myopic as their anti-Brexit peers. U.S. voters are not just voting for a person. For many, voting for Trump really is voting for an idea (rightly or wrongly). Even though he's a moron, Michael Moore captured this sentiment quite well: In other words, it's possible Goldman Sachs have started believing their own propaganda and the data from their media partners' fake polls. If so, they may be in for a bigger surprise than they expected.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 17:19 UTC © Abdalrhman Ismail / Reuters Terrorists in eastern Aleppo opened sniper fire on around 40 civilians who were trying to escape the rebel-controlled area of the city , the Russian Ministry of Defense announced, confirming that no airstrikes have been conducted in the area for nine days. "Because of the sniper fire from the militants, another attempt of the Syrian authorities and the Russian reconciliation center to evacuate around 40 people from eastern districts of Aleppo to safe regions of the city was derailed," Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said on Thursday, adding that the incident happened overnight . The general also said that Russian and Syrian planes have stayed at least 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) away from Aleppo for nine days, after the sorties were halted on October 18. Two days after the strikes ceased, Damascus and Moscow organized safe passage corridors for those wishing to leave the besieged neighborhoods. Six safe routes are now being offered to civilians, while two have been designated for armed rebels. The jihadists, however, refuse to surrender and constantly shell escape routes and government-controlled parts of the city. "The terrorists continue indiscriminately shelling residential districts of the city with makeshift rocket launchers, blocking the civilians from leaving using the humanitarian corridors," the general said. While air raids are suspended, Russia continues to facilitate aid deliveries to Syria's second largest city. On Wednesday, some 15 tons of aid was delivered to residents of Aleppo's Kurdish-run Sheikh Maqsood neighborhood, located close to the demarcation line, the Russian reconciliation center announced. The nine kilogram (19.8 pound) packages included rice, macaroni, and cooking oil. The humanitarian rescue mission was discussed at the UN Security Council meeting earlier on Thursday, where the Russian envoy accused UN teams on the ground of failing to negotiate safe passage for civilians aiming to escape eastern Aleppo. In response, the UN's under secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, Stephen O'Brien, blamed the parties involved in the conflict for their failure to provide adequate security guarantees. Comment: Jan Egeland, special adviser to UN special envoy de Mistura, was more honest, simply stating : "It was very clear today that the Russians want to help us," Jan Egeland said after a meeting in Geneva on the relief effort in Syria. "They would like to help us get access to east Aleppo." O'Brien on the other hand, was moved to American-like heights of pseudo-indignation. Egeland added: "The United States and the like-minded pledged to help us in our humanitarian diplomacy with the armed opposition side, which is difficult and which in the case of medical evacuation was not satisfactory . We lost a lot of time because of all of the conditions that were raised also on that side," he said. Egeland added that "there simply was too little trust, there simply was too much fear, there were too many misunderstandings, there were too many confusing messages for this very complex and very dangerous operation... to take place." The ICRC also welcomed Russia's humanitarian efforts, guaranteeing to do everything possible to protect civilians and evacuate Aleppo. Comment: Murad Gazdiev continues his on-the-ground reporting from Aleppo. In his latest, he speaks to Emenour, Aleppo's only female taxi driver, about life before the war.

Thu, 27 Oct 2016 17:37 UTC © Omar haj kadour / AFP A Syrian man checks the damage at a school after it was hit in an alleged air strike in the village of Hass, in the south of Syria's rebel-held Idlib province on October 26, 2016. Almost two dozen children have reportedly been killed in an airstrike on a school complex in Syria's Idlib province, according to opposition activists . The reports emerged as the UN Security Council debated the dire humanitarian situation in the country. At least 28 civilians, mostly children, were killed when the strikes hit a school complex in the village of Hass, the activists said, pinning the blame on either Russian or Syrian warplanes . The Wednesday tragedy was first reported by the controversial two-man, London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Western-funded Civil Defense Network, also known as the White Helmets . The opposition Idlib Media Center also confirmed a strike on a school, claiming a "rocket" struck the premises. Comment: Red flag number one. Abdulrahman (aka SOHR) is a fraud and a terrorist sympathizer (see: Propaganda spin cycle: 'Syrian Observatory for Human Rights' is funded by US and UK governments ). The White Helmets have the distinction of being actual terrorists (see: White Helmets Fraud: Terrorist Support Group, Not Humanitarians - But West Loves Them! ). They are liars, cheats, frauds, and killers. "One rocket hit the entrance of the school as students were leaving to go home after the school administration decided to end classes for the day because of the raids," an activist said, speaking on condition of anonymity . The UN Children's Rights & Emergency Relief Organization has condemned the tragedy as a potential "war crime," saying it is likely the "deadliest attack on a school" since the beginning of the Syrian war. "Twenty-two children and six teachers were reportedly murdered today when their school compound was repeatedly attacked in Idlib, Syria," UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake said in a statement. He did not specify the circumstances of the attack or the sources of the reports. "This is a tragedy. It is an outrage. And if deliberate, it is a war crime ," Lake added. "When will the world's revulsion at such barbarity be matched by insistence that this must stop?" Comment: UNSG Ban Ki-moon released an identical statement today, saying : "The Secretary-General is appalled by reports of attacks that killed students and teachers in a school complex in Haas village, Idlib governorate, Syria on 26 October. If deliberate, this attack may amount to a war crime." Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova condemned the attack on a school in Syria's Idlib and called for an investigation into the bombing . She also said that international media "launched an attack" on Russia by claiming that Moscow and Damascus are behind the bombing without presenting evidence . Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, said that Moscow will look into the facts to determine whether a possible airstrike destroyed the school, as reports of the deadly assault have so far only been confirmed by groups with tainted reputations and questionable sources. © Omar haj kadour / AFP A general view shows a damaged classroom at a school after it was hit in an alleged air strike in the village of Hass, in the south of Syria's rebel-held Idlib province on October 26, 2016. Commenting on allegations that Russian jets could be responsible, Churkin said that Moscow will wait for the military to assess the situation. "It's horrible, I hope we were not involved. It's the easiest thing for me to say no, but I'm a responsible person, so I need to see what my Ministry of Defense is going to say ," he said. In it latest daily bulletin , the Russian center for the reconciliation of the opposing sides did not mention striking any targets in Idlib province . Citing a military source, Syrian state TV did report that strikes had taken place on terrorist positions in the region, but the targeting of a school complex was not confirmed. Idlib province is controlled by the Army of Conquest, a conglomerate of rebel groups being run by Fateh al-Sham Front (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra). Under the truce agreed between Russia and the US earlier this year, Islamic State and Al-Nusra fighters will continue to be targeted in airstrikes until terrorists lay down their weapons. Comment: The Russian Foreign Ministry explicitly denied carrying out an airstrike on the school. Maria Zakharova: "This is a lie. Russia has nothing to do with this dreadful attack." The Defense Ministry followed up with their own statement, which unlike the paranoid ravings of SOHR and the White Helmets, actually included some evidence: "On Thursday, a Russian UAV was directed to the area, to conduct detailed digital photography," said a statement from Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov. "As can be seen from the photos taken by the drone, there are no signs of damage to the roof of the school, or craters from airstrikes around it ." "We have analyzed the photo and video 'evidence' of the supposed attack. The video published in a range of Western media outlets appears to consist of more than 10 different shots, filmed at different times of the day, and in different resolutions that were edited into a single clip," stated Konashenkov. "The photograph published by AFP shows that only one wall of the school is damaged, and all the desks inside the classroom are in place . The outer fence seen through the hole has no traces of damage from bomb fragments. In a genuine airstrike this is physically impossible - the furniture would have been swept away by the blast wave, and there would have been damage marks on the classroom wall and the outer fence ." © Russian Defense Ministry " Our evidence points to UNICEF falling victim to another scam from the White Helmet fraudsters . Before making resonant statements, UNICEF should check its sources more carefully, to protect the reputation of the respected organization," continued Konashenkov. In addition, just as with the humanitarian aid convoy attack, Russian recon detected a U.S. drone in the area at the time of the attack: No Russian aircraft entered the area over the Syrian Idlib, where the alleged strike took place, [Konashenkov said]. "According to a photo made by a Russian UAV, the school's roof is not damaged and there are no bomb craters in the area near the school. Similar information may be requested from our American colleagues. Russian reconnaissance means registered a US' MQ-1B Predator surveillance-and-attack drone ."
