Nanny In Jail After Force Feeding Baby To Death 2 shares by Ike Mclean / October 27, 2016 / LIFE / 
Oluremi Oyindasola, 66, of Glenarden, Maryland has been charged with second-degree murder, first-degree child abuse resulting in death and other offenses, after she force fed an eight-month-old baby girl who then died. 
Home surveillance footage shows Oyindasola was napping when the eight-month-old child began crying and approached the nanny in a toddler walker. 
Police say Oyindasola then tried to feed the child, and when her attempt was unsuccessful, she 'proceeded to pour a large amount of white liquid directly inside the victim's mouth.' 
Col. Harry Bond with Prince George's County Police told NBC Washington Oyindasola 'forcefully poured the two bottles of what looks to be milk down the baby's mouth, causing her to not be able to breathe, suffocating her, and eventually she died at the hospital.' 
In a news release Prince George's County Police said the following: 
'On October 24th, at about 4.10pm, the baby had been rushed to a hospital after she became unresponsive at home. 
'She was pronounced dead a short time later. An autopsy on Tuesday revealed the baby's cause of death was asphyxiation. The manner of death was ruled a homicide.' 
'The preliminary investigation revealed the injuries to the baby occurred while in the sole care and custody of Oyindasola.' 
Oyindasol is currently in police custody and is being held on $1 million bond.

141 Arrested At Protest Of The Dakota Access Pipeline 2 shares by Ike Mclean / October 28, 2016 / SOCIETY / 
By late Thursday and early Friday morning police dressed in riot gear with armored vehicles were forced to intervene with activists protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline pipeline would run within a half-mile of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. 
By midnight authorities arrested 141 protesters during a standoff that lasted more than six-hours on property that sits in the pipeline's path. 
Protesters blockaded roads and bridges by setting fire to bales of hay and construction equipment. Police also said some protesters threw rocks and fire bombs, and one women even fired three shots from at police, but nobody was hit. 
More than 200 police officers were called in to stop the protests and were forced to use pepper spray and bean bag guns. Humvees, two helicopters and an airplane were also called in to assist law enforcement. 
Authorities said the protesters left the officers with no choice but to intervene. 
'We're trying to avoid confrontation. But they drew the line in the sand today,' Cass County Sheriff Paul D. Laney told reporters Thursday. 
The protesters were a group of Native Americans and environmental activists who have camped on the property since Sunday oppose the $3.8 billion pipeline because they say it could adversely impact drinking water and would disturb sacred burial sites. 
Pictures from the protest can be seen below:

New Leaked Clinton Emails Came from the Devices of Anthony Weiner 6 shares by Dean Daniels / October 28, 2016 / POLITICS / 
On Friday, the FBI announced an investigation into newly leaked emails linked to Hillary Clinton. In a surprising twist, the new leaked emails from the private email server were discovered after the F.B.I. confiscated electronic devices belonging to top aide Huma Abedin, her controversial and perverted husband, Anthony Weiner. 
Officially, the federal law enforcement agents are opening an investigation into Weiner texting a 15-year-old in North Carolina. And according to Director Comey, the F.B.I. were taking steps to 'determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.' 
Shortly after the announcement, Donald Trump utilized the situation to advantage and running theme of Clinton's corruption at a rally in New Hampshire. Supporters nearly cheered in complete unison: 'lock her up.' 
'Hillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office,' said Trump to the roaring crowd. 
'I have great respect for the fact that the F.B.I. and the D.O.J. are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made,' Mr. Trump said, referring also to the Department of Justice. 'This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understand. It is everybody's hope that it is about to be corrected.' 
'The F.B.I.'s decision to reopen their criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's secret email server just 11 days before the election shows how serious this discovery must be,' Reince Priebus, the Republican committee chairman, said in a statement. 'This stunning development raises serious questions about what records may not have been turned over and why, and whether they show intent to violate the law.'

CAN EARLY VOTERS CHANGE THEIR VOTES? 2 shares by DML DAILY / October 29, 2016 / POLITICS / 
Written by Dennis Michael Lynch 
Earlier this week I wrote an op-ed about why I do not like early voting. You can read the op-ed by clicking here . The op-ed offers explanations about why some states offer early voting, and I express reasons how it can negatively effect an election. 
Of all my opinions given, the one that stands out most today is this one: Anything can happen in a presidential election. By voting early, early voters cut themselves short in the event something negative happens to the candidate they voted for. 
With just ten days left until Nov. 8, it was revealed yesterday that Hillary Clinton is once again under FBI investigation for her private email server. Thus, the question becomes can citizens who voted early change their votes? Here is a video that provides the answer:

AUDIO TAPE OF HILLARY LEAKED ABOUT RIGGING ELECTION 20.2K shares by DML DAILY / October 29, 2016 / CRAZY LEFT / According to the Observer , 'On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.' Her conversation was secretly recorded. 
The audio was never released, and according to Chomsky it has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. He claims his copy is the only copy and no one has heard it since 2006. He gave a copy of the audio to the Observer. During the recording, Hillary is allegedly heard about rigging the election. She says: 'I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.' It shows she is willing to do whatever it takes to win. 
Chomsky told the Observer he was taken aback that 'anyone could support the idea '“ offered by a national political leader, no less '“ that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.' The Observer is owned by Donald Trump's son in law. 
Here is the audio recording:

DML Provides Stunning Analysis, Predicts Trump Will Win Presidential Election 26.7K shares by A. Griffee / November 2, 2016 / DML REPORT / With only 6 days left before election day, Dennis Michael Lynch takes an electoral college map and shows how additional states will turn RED and get Trump over 270 electoral college votes to WIN the presidency. 
Taking states that the media has tried to downplay as if Trump has no chance to win them, DML shows how Trump not only has a chance, but predicts he WILL WIN these states, and he backs up his prediction with solid data and facts. 
DML also clarified that the polls are extremely misleading. He said Trump has lit a spark in people who have not voted in decades '“ some who have never voted '“ but now they are embracing Trump. These people are not being included in the polls. 
Early voting is also not a true representation of what's about to happen, because more Democrats tend to show up for early voting, while the majority of Republicans wait until election day. 
WATCH THIS EYE-OPENING VIDEO for a critical state-by-state analysis that proves Trump can easily win the election '“ then SHARE IT EVERYWHERE! 
**Note: In the video when DML talks about PA voting for Trump, he forgot to mention 100k Democrats in PA switched parties over the past year. In addition, PA saw an eye-popping number of new voters register as Republicans. Combined, PA in this election has 240,000 more Republicans than it did in 2012.

by DML DAILY / November 4, 2016 / IMMIGRATION / 
Illegal aliens are flooding through the border at an unprecedented pace. According to Border Patrol agents the surge is taking place because human smugglers are issuing warning that it's now or never to get into the U.S. 
If Trump wins, the illegal aliens are told there will be a giant wall keeping them out of the U.S. permanently. If Clinton wins, they are led to believe amnesty will be granted. Both incentives are driving the illegal entries to a level not seen in years, and according to agents in Texas, the Border Patrol is overwhelmed with 1,000 apprehensions per night in just one sector. 
According to the Department of Homeland Security, in fiscal 2016, the Border Patrol apprehended 117,200 immigrants from Central America, almost one-third of all apprehensions border-wide '” and 5,000 more than during the so-called surge of 2014. The agency also apprehended 5,000 Haitians, up from just 700 last year. The number of immigrants claiming to be from Africa and Asia also is up. 

'When you stop somebody, you ask their name and the first thing they tell you is '“ 'I'm here for asylum, I can't go home because they'll kill me.' '¦ When it takes a good five or six minutes just to get their name out of them, they have a rehearsed story,' said Chris Cabrera, a representative from the Border Patrol Council told Fox News. 'Once they get those papers saying they can pass through our checkpoint, we'll never see them again.' 
Typically, an illegal immigrant pays a $4,000 to $6,000 smuggling fee to the drug cartels. Once here, he said the Mexican government had given each a number based on their arrival.

National Mood' Focus Group Reflects Angry, Divided America 0 shares by A. Griffee / November 7, 2016 / POLITICS / A focus group of 23 people put together by CBS News revealed a frightening look at what America has become '“ a divided nation. 
Republican pollster, public opinion analyst and CBS News consultant Frank Luntz interviewed the group, and even lost it himself during the heated discussion. He came away deeply disturbed by what he saw. 
Whether they were Republicans or Democrats, supporting Trump or Clinton, they were all angry. Out of the 23 people, only 3 raised their hands saying they were voting for a candidate. The others were voting just to vote against a candidate. 
'When we don't agree on the same facts, how can we possibly agree on the same solutions?' Luntz asked.

In the summer of 2015 before the current presidential race ignited, and two weeks before Trump announced his candidacy, DML gave a compelling speech during his tour in the state of Massachusetts. In front of an audience at a small town synagogue, the award-winning businessman and conservative commentator laid out the key component that he believed would catapult any presidential candidate above all the others: 'putting Americans first.' 
DML emphasizes during his 'Americans first' speech that the number one issue in America is immigration. He explains in crystal clear detail how immigration, both legal and illegal, goes beyond party identification. He says 'it's not a Democrat or Republican issue '” it's an American issue.' 
Having traveled the country by car exploring the idea of running for president himself, DML got a real sense for what concerned Americans most. Therefore, he knew before the rest of us that the ideal candidate of 2016 would be someone who has the audacity and the courage to tell the American people he or she will commit to the deportation of illegal immigrants. 
'Remember, it's not an anti-immigration; it's an anti-illegal immigration; and it's about being pro-America.' 
While putting Americans first would have been DML's campaign theme had he chosen to run for the highest office in the land, this strategy was instead adopted by none other than Donald J.Trump. This is one major reason why DML has supported Trump since day one. 
Trump has done more than proven DML correct. Trump has proven how powerful the ' Americans first' ideology is during a day and age when progressive politicians like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are catering to foreign workers and corporate donors at the expense of the American people who are left to rot on the back burner. 
Watch an excerpt from the speech, and then check out DML's electoral map and how he sees Trump winning on Tuesday.

Miley Cyrus Crying Over Trump Victory (Video) 2 shares by Ike Mclean / November 11, 2016 / POLITICS / 
After it was announced that Donald Trump would be the 45 th president of the United States, Miley Cyrus posted a video online of her crying over the results. 
With tears rolling down her face Cyrus says, 'So, probably like most people'”well, maybe not, because given the result'”maybe I really am different and maybe a lot of people that I'm surrounded by think with open minds and open hearts like I do. And I do want to say that I've been very vocal for my support for everyone besides Donald Trump. Heavily supported Bernie. Heavily supported Hillary. And I still think that in her lifetime she deserves to be the first female president, and that's what makes me so sad.' 
'I just wish that she had that opportunity. Because she fought for so long and because I believe her when she says that she loves this country. This is all she's ever done. She's given her life to make it better. But, like Donald Trump so ironically played after his speech, it said, 'You can't always get what you want.' And happy hippies, we adjust and we accept everyone for who they are. And so Donald Trump, I accept you,' she said. 'And this hurts to say, but I even accept you as the President of the United States, and that's fine'¦because I think now I want to be hopeful.' 
She then went on to thank Barack Obama for 'everything he has done the past eight years,' and thanked Hillary 'for inspiring us.'

SOROS & HIS CONNECTION TO THE RIOTS 53.6K shares by DML DAILY / November 12, 2016 / CRAZY LEFT / 
The mainstream media is pushing the narrative that the protests spreading throughout the country are peaceful, and represent the widespread hatred for President-elect Donald Trump. Unfortunately, the media is pushing a false narrative. 
Fact is theses are not protests. According to the law, the events taking place are riots. Under Federal Law, a riot is a public disturbance involving an act of violence by one or more persons assembled in a group of at least three people. Inciting a riot applies to a person who organizes, encourages, or participates in a riot. It can apply to one who urges or instigates others to riot. According to 18 USCS 2102 ' to incite a riot', or ' to organize, promote, encourage, participate in, or carry on a riot', includes, but is not limited to, urging or instigating other persons to riot. 
George Soros, the radical left leaning billionaire who supported Hillary Clinton and donates to radical groups such as Black Lives Matter and MoveOn.org, is behind the riots and needs to be held accountable. The majority of people showing up to these riots are paid to do so by Soros-funded-groups. 
Below is a video produced by RT.com It connects Soros to the riots. This video was sent to us by one of our readers, Charee.

Vice President-elect Mike Pence was attending the Broadway Musical 'Hamilton' on Friday night when the cast decided to send a political message to Trump and his administration. 
Brandon Victor Dixon, the actor who played the part of Vice President Aaron Burr during the musical about the life of the Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, acknowledged that Pence was in the crowd and then said the following: 
'We, sir '” we '” are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights. We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.' 
Dixon was asked on 'CBS This Morning' Monday about the decision to deliver his political message, which prompted Donald Trump to take to Twitter and say that Pence was 'harassed' and that the cast was 'very rude.' 
'The president-elect is demanding an apology,' CBS anchor Charlie Rose said to Dixon during the Monday morning interview. 
'I heard,' Dixon responded. 
'We assume that no apology is forthcoming?' Rose asked. 
'There is nothing to apologize for,' Dixon said. 
Dixon then added that this is 'certainly not the first time, nor will it be the last, that somebody went into a theater and began to act inappropriately or stand up and interrupt the show.'

Missing California Mother Found Safe On Thanksgiving Day 3.8K shares by Ike Mclean / November 25, 2016 / LIFE / 
A 34-year-old mother of two who vanished on November 2 while out jogging near her home in Northern California has been found alive and safe, the Shasta County Sheriff's Department said Thursday. 
Sherri Papini reappeared on Thanksgiving morning approximately 150 miles away from her house after she flagged down a car on I-5 near Sacramento. 
'She is safe, in stable condition, and receiving medical clearance at an undisclosed hospital. She has been reunited with her husband,' said Sheriff Tom Bosenko. 
Police are now actively searching for two Hispanic women armed with handguns and a dark SUV in connection to the kidnapping. There is no known motive in the case, authorities said on Thursday. 
An iPhone, a pair of earbuds and a few strands of what was believed to be her hair were the only leads found on a jogging trail close to the Papini's home when she went missing, CNN reported. 
Sherri's husband Keith noticed something was wrong when he arrived home, things were quiet, and his wife and two kids were not there. 
'On normal days, I would open the door and my family comes, runs and gives me a hug,' he told KRCR-TV . 
Keith called the day care center they leave their children at and was told his 2 and 4 year old kids were not picked up yet. He then tracked his wife's Iphone, found it was down the street, and told the news station 'That's when I knew she had been taken or abducted, in my opinion.' 
An anonymous donor had offered a $50,000 ransom to her captor for her safe return. The amount was raised to $100,000 and then withdrawn a day before she reappeared, DailyMail reported.
