If a movie is based on a book that is based on a real experiment that later actually happens in real life, is it 'real' or 'fiction.' Join us today on The Corbett Report as we step through the looking glass in search of information about Sirhan Sirhan, the shooting of RFK, CIA mind control experiments, and the blurring of the line between real life and fantasy.

The official story : On October 15th the USS Mason picked up two targets believed to be cruise missiles, forcing it to deploy (undisclosed) 'counter measures.' 
Notice the words 'believed to be' in that last sentence? The Pentagon hopes you didn't, because, as it turns out, they're not so sure now. As USNI News reported last week, the Pentagon is 'still unsure' if the Mason was actually attacked at all on the 15th. 'We actually have not confirmed that happened and we're going back and looking at all the information to see what might or might not have happened and that's where we are,' said Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis. 
Does any of this sound familiar? It should'¦

FBI Director threw the 2016 presidential (s)election into (yet more) chaos by delivering an October surprise: the re-opening of the Clinton email investigation. Are the string-pullers abandoning Hillary? Or would they prefer a lame-duck president to be the face of the declining American empire? Is chaos part of the plan? Today we talk to Michel Chossudovsky of GlobalResearch.ca about the Comey letter and its potential implications on the emerging world (dis)order.

We all remember the lies that led the US into the Iraq war. 
But after years of media indoctrination, it's easy to forget the other lie that helped rally the country around the illegal invasion of Iraq. 
John McCain : There is some indication, and I don't have the conclusions, but some of this anthrax may'Š'”'Šand I emphasize may'Š'”'Šhave come from Iraq. 
David Letterman : Oh, is that right? 
John McCain : If that should be the case, that's when some tough decisions are gonna have to be made. 
Source: McCain and the Anthrax Scare [0:12 '“ 0:26] (Higher quality clip?) 
'When Iraq finally admitted having these weapons in 1995, the quantities were vast. Less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax, a little bit about this amount '“ this is just about the amount of a teaspoon '“ less than a teaspoon full of dry anthrax in an envelope shut down the United States Senate in the fall of 2001. This forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope. 
'Iraq declared 8,500 liters of anthrax, but UNSCOM estimates that Saddam Hussein could have produced 25,000 liters. If concentrated into this dry form, this amount would be enough to fill tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons. And Saddam Hussein has not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoon-full of this deadly material.' 
Source: Colin Powell's Presentation to the UN on Iraq WMD [26:37 '“ 27:45] 
Although it is difficult to remember at this point, the anthrax scare of late 2001 was widely seen as a follow-up to the 9/11 attacks, and a sign of things to come at the dawn of the so-called War on Terror. Beginning in late September and continuing for several weeks, multiple anthrax-laced letters were mailed to various media offices and the offices of two US Senators, killing five and injuring 17. 
It did not take long, however, for the neocons in the Bush administration to start insinuating that the anthrax scare was tied to their two favourite boogeymen: Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden. 
In his book, ' The 2001 Anthrax Deception ,' Dr. Graeme MacQueen describes this as 'the double perpetrator hypothesis,' an attempt to blame the attacks on both Al Qaeda and Iraq. He writes: 
'What I call the 'Double Perpetrator hypothesis' held that Bin Laden's group sent the anthrax spores through the mail but that the group had a state sponsor that had supplied the spores, namely Iraq.' 
This hypothesis, insinuated by key government officials and parroted by the press, had the added benefit of explaining how the anthrax spores used in the attack could have been weaponized so efficiently. 
MACQUEEN1 '“'Well the young woman who opened Senator Daschle's mail'¦Afghanistan and Iraq' [0:16 '“ 2:02] 
The story of Iraqi collusion with Al Qaeda sounded credible enough to an American public that had no familiarity with the Muslim world and was still reeling in shock from the attacks of 9/11. The only problem with that story is that it was a complete lie. 
When key government scientists came out to denounce the claim that the anthrax contained traces of bentonite, a signature of the Iraqi anthrax program, the Bush administration sought to distance itself from any direct connection between Saddam and the attacks. 
As filmmaker Robbie Martin explains in his documentary, American Anthrax , however, that connection was reinforced to the public by way of a complicit corporate media. 
Martin points to disgraced ex-New York Times journalist and Iraqi WMD pusher Judy Miller as a particularly egregious example of how the media laid the groundwork for the campaign to tie Iraq to the anthrax letters. 
As we now know, of course, the anthrax attacks were a false flag event. 
By early 2002 it was confirmed that the anthrax had sourced to the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, a key facility within America's own bioweapons program. Soon suspicion fell on Steven Hatfill, a 'person of interest' identified by the FBI who eventually won a $4.6 million lawsuit against the Department of Justice for falsely accusing him of his participation in the attacks and illegally leaking his identity to the press. The blame for the attacks was then pinned on Bruce Ivins, a researcher at Fort Detrick who conveniently died before the FBI could identify him or try him in court. The National Academy of Sciences and the Government Accountability Office have both cast doubt on the FBI's scientific investigation of the attacks, however, and a whistleblower within the FBI's own investigation has revealed that the Bureau is sitting on evidence that would exonerate Ivins. 
Whoever the perpetrator may have been'“even accepting that Ivins was the attacker'“it is a fact that the attacks were a false flag, using crudely forged letters to convince the American public that they were written by Al Qaeda agents. And that false flag was aided by the government officials and corporate media talking heads who were happy to propagate this false story in the lead up to war in Iraq. 
The legacy of that war remains with us today. The middle east, including Iraq itself, remains in chaos, a direct result of the illegal invasion and occupation of that country. An invasion and occupation that was sold to the public on the back of brazen lies and outright fabrications. 
The blood of a million dead Iraqis stains the hands of those who lied the public into that war, and those who aided and abetted those liars. 
Meanwhile, the anthrax attacks themselves remain a case study in how a false flag event can be used to whip the public into hysteria and be led into supporting illegal wars of aggression.

On Friday, October 28th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey dropped a political bombshell just 10 days out from the presidential (s)election. 
Many theories have so far been floated about why the FBI director issued this letter just days before a national (s)election. Some of them, including the idea that Comey is struggling against an internal insurrection of agents disgruntled by his earlier decision not to prosecute Clinton, seem to have a basis in reality. Others, including the idea that Comey is an agent of the Russians, working in collusion with Putin and Trump to put a Kremlin puppet in the White House, do not. 
But what seemingly everyone has missed with regard to the letter is that it was issued just four days after another bombshell piece of information'¦

In Douglas Adams' So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish , there is a scene where a spaceship lands on earth and a robot emerges from the craft, proclaiming that 'I come in peace' and exhorting the earthlings to 'take me to your Lizard.' The story's protagonist, Arthur Dent, has this strange request explained to him by his friend, Ford Prefect, an experienced galactic hitchhiker: 
'It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see'¦' 
'You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?' 
'No,' said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down him, 'nothing so simple. Nothing anything like so straightforward. On its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people.' 
'Odd,' said Arthur, 'I thought you said it was a democracy.' 
'I did,' said ford. 'It is.' 
'So,' said Arthur, hoping he wasn't sounding ridiculously obtuse, 'why don't the people get rid of the lizards?' 
'It honestly doesn't occur to them,' said Ford. 'They've all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they've voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.' 
'You mean they actually vote for the lizards?' 
'Oh yes,' said Ford with a shrug, 'of course.' 
'But,' said Arthur, going for the big one again, 'why?' 
'Because if they didn't vote for a lizard,' said Ford, 'the wrong lizard might get in. Got any gin?' 
'What?' 
'I said,' said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, 'have you got any gin?' 
'I'll look. Tell me about the lizards.' 
Ford shrugged again. 
'Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them,' he said. 'They're completely wrong of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone's got to say it.' 
If only this was a joke. But here we are, on the verge of a contest between the two least respected, most distrusted candidates to run for office in modern political history. And some people say these lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them. 
If there is any solace at all in this year's selection cycle it is that, as The Corbett Report has been pointing out since the very day of its inception, there is absolutely nothing at stake here; the presidential figureheads are mere puppets, false fronts for the shadow government and deep state that commands and controls the military, economic and diplomatic machinery of the US-led world empire. 
Do you really think the oligarchs put their entire system up on the chopping block every four years, hoping against hope that the public doesn't use the dreaded ballot box to vote them out of power, dashing decades (or centuries) of carefully cultivated enslavement with pencils and touchscreens? Just in case anyone dislikes rhetorical questions, let me answer that one for you: No. No they do not. 
But don't take my word for it. Take Emma Goldman. As she's been reputed to have said (and if she didn't, feel free to tell other people that I said it): 'If voting changed anything, they'd make it illegal.' 
Or take H.L Mencken, who in his usual inimitable fashion quipped : 
The state'”or, to make the matter more concrete, the government'”consists of a gang of men exactly like you and me. They have, taking one with another, no special talent for the business of government; they have only a talent for getting and holding office. Their principal device to that end is to search out groups who pant and pine for something they can't get, and to promise to give it to them. Nine times out of ten that promise is worth nothing. The tenth time it is made good by looting A to satisfy B. In other words, government is a broker in pillage, and every election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods. 
Or take Lysander Spooner, who wrote : 
The principle that the majority have a right to rule the minority, practically resolves all government into a mere contest between two bodies of men, as to which of them shall be masters, and which of them slaves; a contest, that '“ however bloody '“ can, in the nature of things, never be finally closed, so long as man refuses to be a slave. 
Or Wendy McElroy, who reminds us that: 
Voting is not an act of political freedom. It is an act of political conformity. Those who refuse to vote are not expressing silence. They are screaming in the politician's ear: 'You do not represent me. This is not a process in which my voice matters. I do not believe you.' 
Yes, voting is worse than a dead end. It's less effective than bashing your head against a wall in a vain attempt to cure your headache. It's more pathetic than allowing the oligarchs into your kitchen and then begging for a scrap of food from your own table. It is evil, immoral and contemptible. It is the act of a slave who has internalized that slavery so thoroughly that he wants to ensure that everyone around him is enslaved, too. 
But, as I pointed out in yesterday's conversation with Larken Rose, if there is any bright spot in all of this it is that your vote doesn't matter anyway and will not change anything at all. It will not even 'register as a protest' as some would like to believe, since the elections are rigged and the votes aren't counted. 
So if you are so inclined, knock yourself out. Cast a ballot. But instead of sitting back and feeling good about yourself for having done this senseless, meaningless and immoral act, can we at least agree to use the next 1460 days to do something actually productive? I leave it entirely up to you how to interpret the phrase 'actually productive,' but if you'd allow me to offer some humble suggestions: 
Find, join or create a community organization or freedom cell with a focus on fostering economic connections and social ties with people in your geographical area. 
Find, join or create a community currency , community trading program or community exchange to foster agoristic connection between yourself and others in your area. 
Commit to spending a certain amount of time each week spreading awareness about the banking oligarchy , false flag terrorism , GMO crops , or any subject you feel strongly about, either offline or online, using the work of others or by starting your own blog, newsletter or community meet up group. 
Learn about gardening , canning, appliance repair, 3D printing , monetary theory , or any subject that you think will be handy in the event of a government collapse (or even if the government doesn't collapse). 
Read more books. Spend less time arguing with people online and more time making friends at the local coffee shop. Learn a new skill and teach it to someone else. 
In short, do all of the million things that have nothing whatsoever to do with the phony baloney political charade exemplified by national selection day. Because if all you ever do is tick a box in a voting booth and sit back to see who wins the rigged sporting event, you probably believe the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to you.

The voting machines have decided who will be the next puppet figurehead of the Pax Americana deep state for the next four years. The circus is over and the peanut shells are being swept out of the stands. So what do we have to show for all of it? 
Well, I have some good news, some bad news, and some not-so-good news for you. Let's start with the bad news. 
Apparently some people voted for Trump in the belief that he was some sort of anti-establishment truth-telling hero of the working class. I hate to be the one to disabuse you of this notion, so let's just look at his transition team, his campaign team, the people who have already been tapped to be part of the new administration and the people who are being contacted for potential cabinet appointments. Warning: It's not a pretty picture.

Even after the election the Clinton side continues with lawless agitation, intimidation and violence in the streets, demonstrating to reasonable people everywhere that Americans did make the right choice. Thank you MSM and Mr. Soros for showing everyone just how free, democratic, big hearted and open the globalist new world order would really be if Hillary had won. 
If the US election rules had been that the candidates had to win the popular vote in order to be elected, then Trump would have campaigned more vigorously in the large cities and likely also would have won that contest in a landslide. But how much more of a landslide that would have been can be seen by considering what really happened. 
The people who supported Trump mainly voted for jobs and to save core values and constitutional rights from a misguided globalism being imposed upon them. They were essentially voting to save their nation from an establishment which has been systematically outsourcing just about everything which matters to them. However, despite the stakes they were and remain essentially principled people adhering to the electoral rules of fair play for lawful democratic change. The Clinton side on the other hand appeared devoid of any real principles other than their own interests. During the election the Clinton side used intimidation tactics of paid agitators. They cheated by swelling voters lists by opening the border and signing up droves of illegal immigrants. Even voter fraud and rigged voting machines were acceptable to them. But most of all they were supported by an absolutely biased, corrupt and lying mainstream media. The effect of the media was so pervasive that Trump supporters were generally so ridiculed and shunned that few made their views known. Without such dishonest, illegal and oppressive tactics by the Clinton side, the Trump vote would most certainly have been much much greater. In the circumstances the Clinton loss could not be more embarrassing for her, her party and the MSM.

Do you have the sinking feeling that Trump may start backing off his promises now that he's in power.

Well don't worry, it's already happening and it has nothing whatsoever to do with the political game that the ruling oligarchs entice you to play once every four years.

A helpful Corbett Report listener pointed me to the source of the Soros 60 Minutes video that emerged earlier this week: a collaborative investigation by The_Donald subreddit. This is a great example of the 'open source investigation' model of collaborative research that I've been fostering at The Corbett Report for the past few years. So what should we be focusing our energy on next?

What the government giveth, the government taketh away. Like that money in your wallet. Do you really think it's yours? If so, the people of India would like to have a word with you. 
Oh, haven't you heard? In case you missed the story during the din and clatter of the US sElection circus, all hell has broken loose in India. 
It all started on November 8th, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a surprise television address to the nation. As you might have guessed, this was no stale policy speech. Instead, Modi sent shockwaves through the country (and the region) by announcing that as of midnight that evening, existing 500 and 1000 rupee notes would no longer be accepted as legal tender. The tax cattle would have until December 30th to trade in their 500 and 1000 rupee notes at post offices and banks. 
And just like that the bits of colored paper in everyone's wallets were revealed as'¦well, useless bits of colored paper.

I'm all for a recount, because it could do exactly what James suggests, puts the whole thing in chaos (and this is exactly what I said here before the election). I was furious when Al Gore simply gave up in 2000 when he should have fought on to the bitter end, and if there really are 'irregularities' which would put this election in question, the people need to know that, even if it doesn't actually change anything. Chaos is a very revealing state, and anything that elevates awareness of the farce that is our 'two faces of a single coin' political system is good. 
Of course if one believes the election was totally rigged start to finish, then no doubt they would believe that this is just another act in the play already written, so probably would downplay it entirely. So, ironically, the people who most believe the election was rigged are the ones who care least about that being explored. Because that exploration is just as false as the election, of course. That's an unfortunate position, I think, and in this case may just go to serve the purposes of the criminal elite; that's the trap in that sort of absolutist structuralist thinking. 
I say stir it up, even if in the end it only provides for interesting theater.
