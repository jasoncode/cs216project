shorty PEPE ESCOBAR 'Your honors, in this venue I announce my separation from the United States'¶both in military and economics also.' T hus Philippines President Rodrigo 'The Punisher' Duterte unleashed a geopolitical earthquake encompassing Eurasia and reverberating all across the Pacific Ocean.
And talk about choosing his venue with aplomb; right in the heart of the Rising Dragon, no less. 
Capping his state visit to Beijing, Duterte then coined the mantra 'ì pregnant with overtones 'ì that will keep ringing all across the global South; 'America has lost.' 
And if that was not enough, he announced a new alliance 'ì Philippines, China and Russia 'ì is about to emerge; 'there are three of us against the world.' 
Predictably, the Beltway establishment in the 'indispensable nation' went bananas, reacting as 'puzzled' or in outright anger, dispersing the usual expletives on the 'crude populist', 'unhinged leader'. 
The bottom line is that it takes a lot of balls for the leader of a poor, developing country, in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, to openly defy the hyperpower. Yet what Duterte is gaming at is pure realpolitik; if he prevails, he will be able to deftly play the US against China to the benefit of Filipino interests. 
'The springtime of our relationship' 
It did start with a bang; during Duterte's China visit, Manila inked no less than $13 billion in deals with Beijing 'ì from trade and investment to drug control, maritime security and infrastructure. 
Beijing pulled out all stops to make Duterte feel welcomed. 
President Xi Jinping suggested Manila and Beijing should 'temporarily put aside' the intractable South China Sea disputes and learn from the 'political wisdom' of history 'ì as in give space to diplomatic talks. After all, the two peoples were 'blood-linked brothers.' 
Duterte replied in kind; 'Even as we arrive in Beijing close to winter, this is the springtime of our relationship,' he told Xi at the Great Hall of the People. 
China is already the Philippines' second-largest trade partner, behind Japan, the US and Singapore. Filipino exports to these three are at roughly 42.7 percent of the total, compared to 22.1 to China/Hong Kong. Imports from China are roughly 16.1 percent of the total. Even as trade with China is bound to rise, what really matters for Duterte is massive Chinese infrastructure investment. 
What this will mean in practice is indeed ground-breaking; the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) will definitely be involved in Philippine economic development; Manila will be more involved in promoting smooth China-ASEAN relations in all sorts of regional issues (it takes the rotating chair of ASEAN in 2017); and the Philippines will be more integrated in the New Silk Roads, a.k.a. One Belt, One Road (OBOR). 
Three strikes; no wonder the US is out. And there's even a fourth strike, embedded in Duterte's promise that he will soon end military cooperation with the US, despite the opposition of part of the Filipino armed forces. 
Watch the First Island Chain 
The build-up had already been dramatic enough. On the eve of his meeting with Xi, talking to members of the Filipino community in Beijing, Duterte said, 'it's time to say goodbye' to the US; 'I will not ask but if they (the Chinese) offer and if they'll ask me, do you need this aid? [I will say] Of course, we are very poor.' 
Then the clincher; 'I will not go to America anymore '¶ We will just be insulted there.' Naval Base Subic Bay was a major ship-repair, supply, and rest and recreation facility of the Spanish Navy and subsequently the United States Navy located in Olongapo, Zambales, Philippines. The base was 262 square miles, about the size of Singapore. It was finally turned over to the Filipino government in 1992. 
The US was the colonial power in the Philippines from 1899 to 1942. Hollywood permeates the collective unconscious. English is the lingua franca 'ì side by side with tagalog. But the tentacles of Uncle Sam's 'protection' racket are not exactly welcomed. Two of the largest components of the US Empire of Bases were located for decades in the Philippines; Clark Air Force Base and Subic Bay Naval Base. 
Clark, occupying 230 square miles, with 15,000 people, was busy to death during the Vietnam War 'ì the main hub for men and hardware in and out of Saigon. Then it turned into one of those Pentagon 'forward operating' HQs. Subic, occupying 260 square miles, was as busy as Clark. It was the forward operating base for the US 7th Fleet. 
Already in 1987, before the end of the Cold War, the RAND corporation was alarmed by the loss of both bases; that would be 'devastating for regional security'. Devastating' in the 'ì mythical 'ì sense of 'defending the interests of ASEAN' and the 'security of the sea-lanes'. 
Translation; the Pentagon and the US Navy would lose a key instrument of pressure over ASEAN, as protecting the 'security of the sea-lanes' was always the key justification for those bases. 
And lose they eventually did; Clark was closed down in November 1991, and Subic in November 1992. 
It took years for China to sense an opening 'ì and profit from it; after all during the 1990s and the early 2000s, the absolute priority was breakneck speed internal development. But then Beijing did the math; no more US bases opened untold vistas as far as the First Island Chain is concerned. 
The First Island Chain is a product, over millennia, of the fabulous tectonic forces of the Ring of Fire; a chain of islands running from southern Japan in the north to Borneo in the south. For Beijing, they work as a sort of shield for the Chinese eastern seaboard; if this chain is secure, Asia is secure. 
For all practical purposes, Beijing considers the First Island Chain as a non-negotiable Western Pacific demarcation zone 'ì ideally with no foreign (as in US) interference. The South China Sea 'ì which in parts is characterized by Manila as the Western Philippine Sea 'ì is inside the First Island Chain. So to really secure the First Island Chain, the South China Sea must be free of foreign interference. 
And here we are plunged at the heart of arguably the key 21st century hotspot in Asian geopolitics 'ì the main reason for the Obama administration's pivot to Asia. 
The US Navy so far counted on the Philippines to oppose the proverbial, hyped up 'Chinese aggression' in the South China and East China seas. The neocon/neoliberalcon industrial-military complex fury against 'unhinged' Duterte's game-changer is that containing China and ruling over the First Island Chain has been at the core of US naval strategy since the beginning of the Cold War. 
Beijing, meanwhile, will have all the time needed to polish its strategic environment. This has nothing to do with 'freedom of navigation' and protecting sea-lanes; everyone needs South China Sea cross-trade. It's all about China 'ì perhaps within the next ten years 'ì being able to deny 'access' to the US Navy in the South China Sea and inside the First Island Chain. 
Duterte's game-changing 'America has lost' is just a new salvo in arguably the key 21st century geopolitical thriller. A Supreme Court justice in Manila, for instance, has warned Duterte that, were he to give up sovereignty over the Scarborough Shoal, he could be impeached. That won't happen; Duterte wants loads of Chinese trade and investment, not abdicate from sovereignty. He'd rather be ready to confront being demonized by the hyperpower as much as the late Hugo Chavez was in his heyday.

shorty By Dar√≠o Mizrahi T homas Sankara was a young communist officer who attempted to take Burkina Faso out of the neocolonial orbit of France, but was murdered by his closest comrades. During Sankara's short time in power, Burkina Faso became self-sufficient in grains. 'He was the first to forbid female genital mutilation, and included women in all realms of public administration.' His killer, Blaise Compaor√©, ruled for 27 years, until run out of the country in 2014 . This article previously appeared in The Dawn [3] . 'He created the Communist Officers' Group, which overthrew the government on November 7, 1982.' Earlier this month, Burkina Faso began to exhume the remains of the leader that founded the country in 1984. They seek to reveal the murderous conspiracy that ended his life, after four years of leading a revolutionary government. Thomas Isidore No√´l Sankara was born on December 21, 1949 in what is known today as Burkina Faso, but was then still a French colony called Alta Volta . When he finished secondary school, at 19, he began a prolific military career that would be inextricably linked to politics. Just 14 years later, Sankara made a coup d'√©tat through armed struggle and an overwhelming support from the population and assumed the leadership of the country. Back then, he was already a symbol throughout the continent. Thanks to a combination of charisma, courage and intelligence and his undoubtedly revolutionary convictions, the world began to talk about 'African Che Guevara.' Just like the Argentine guerrilla, he had an early, tragic death, due to the betrayal of his closest comrade. Now, 28 years after his murder, and after the work to exhume his remains began, to unveil his mysterious end, Infobae interviewed Spanish writer Antonio Lozano, one of the most notorious experts on the Burkinese leader. As a corollary to his investigations, in 2006 he published The Sankara Case (Almuzara Ed), a novel that combines historical accuracy with fiction to retell his eventful life and tragic murder. The creation of a revolutionary leader 'Sankara wanted to be a doctor, but his family was poor and his only option if he wanted to study was to attend a military academy. He was a Christian and that was always a part of his ideology,' Lozano says. 'Surprisingly, at the time many of the professors of the military academy were Marxists', Lozano explained, 'so there he came into contact with these ideas. When he finished the first level of studies, his good grades allowed him to train as an Official of the Army in Madagascar, a country where there were constant popular revolts'. When he returned to Alto Volta, Sankara had strong convictions and thought that it was essential to break with the colonial oppression of his nation, which was one of the poorest of the planet. They sent him to the city of P√¥, where his military and political career began. He had soldiers under his command which he taught his ideas. And on the other hand he worked with the poor people of the city and earned their respect and admiration. 'When he went to Rabat, Morocco, to take a course he met Blaise Compaor√©, who became a great friend and comrade-in-arms of his, and who would later do the revolution with him. When he returned to Alto Volta, he participated in a short war against Mali, where he shined for an incursion he did with his men and made him famous and praised by the population,' the historian says. 'Sankara had strong convictions and thought that it was essential to break with the colonial oppression of his nation, which was one of the poorest of the planet.' I n 1981, he was appointed Secretary of Information of the State. But six months after, he announced his resignation in an explosive press conference, in which he denounced the authoritarianism of the government and the attempts to 'put a gag on the people.' This consolidated his fame as one of the most notorious figures of the country. He had created, together with Campaor√© and other members of the Armed Forces, the Communist Officers' Group. This group overthrew the government on November 7, 1982, and appointed a new President: Jean-Baptiste Ou√©draogo. Sankara was appointed Prime Minister in January 1983. 'Muammar Khadafi, who was already governing Linya and was one of the biggest figures of Arab socialism at the time, invited him to his country and considered him a comrade. At that time, every rally he held in Alto Volta was attended by thousands.' But France wouldn't have this. 'Due to the pressure of France and the right-wing coalition that was still in the government, he was imprisoned', Lozano recounts. 'So Compaor√© and his allies started to act' to get him released, and 'with the help of mass mobilizations of the Burkinese people', they recovered Sankara from the claws of the metropoli. In August 4, 1983, they took the power through armed struggle. At 33, he was appointed president and the Sankara's Revolution began. The foundation of a new country 'He created a revolutionary process that was unheard of in Africa. On August 4, 1984, he changed the name of Alto Volta to Burkina Faso, which means 'Land of the Honest People' which reflects his struggle against corruption, an endemic disease of African governments. He lead by example: he continued earning the same amount he made as Captain of the Army, sold all of the expensive cars owned by the state and adopted as official vehicle the cheapest car in the market, the Renault 5.' He decreased the salaries of all public officers, forbade the use of chauffeurs and mandated that all ministers had to travel in tourist class. He also stood against nepotisms and didn't allow family-members to work for the state. His austerity was a characteristic that defined him until his death. 'At the time he was murdered, his only possessions were a mortgaged house and three bikes' Lozano says. The other main axis of his administration was the incentive to education and culture. 'In a single year, the alphabetization rate went from 12 to 36%, and it kept raising thanks to the rural schools he created throughout the country.' He also made great advances in health. He created vaccination commands that in just a few months immunized almost all Burkinese children against infectious diseases that were causing great harm. 'At the time he was murdered, his only possessions were a mortgaged house and three bikes.' B ut the greatest revolution he led was the one in favor of women's rights . He was the first to forbid female genital mutilation. He promoted the celebration of March 8 and included women in all realms of public administration. In the economic aspect, 'he made an agrarian reform that redistributed land and gave out fertilizers and seeds to peasants, and created small dams. Through this, he managed to make Burkina Faso one of the few countries of the region to acquire self-sufficiency in the cereal supply, which is the base of the population's diet.' Sankara knew that in order to be able to implement his agenda of reforms, he had to achieve 'economic independence' for the country. This led him to confront the international financial system, and particularly the French one. Despite the declaration of independence, the country was still heavily tied to its former metropoli. The refusal to pay the external debt, which had been taken by previous governments, was one of his main measures. 'In his last big speech, which he gave in September 1987 in the context of the General Assembly of the African Union, he defended these ideas once again and said that if they didn't stand with him, he wouldn't be there the following year. And, in fact, he didn't live to see the 1988 assembly,' the biographer said. 'He said that the only one with the ability to kill him was Blaise Compaor√©, because he knew him better than anybody else.' S ankara had made powerful enemies, both inside and outside the country. 'He saw the end coming. In an interview he gave 15 days before his death to a newspaper from Belgium, when they asked about potential conspiracies he said that the only one with the ability to kill him was Blaise Compaor√©, because he knew him better than anybody else. His circle told him several times to cut him off because he was a threat. But his answer was always the same: he was like a brother.' Compaor√© disagreed with many of Sankara's policies, especially with the ones that restricted the acts of public officers. On October 15, 1987, an armed group entered Thomas Sankara's office while he was in a meeting with the 12 members of the National Council of the Revolution. Sankara, who was 37 at the time, was murdered along with the rest of the attendants. Simultaneously, Compaor√© made a coup d'√©tat and became the President of Burkina Faso. He stayed in power for 27 years, until mass revolts forced him to flee the country in 2014. Source URL: http://blackagendareport.com/thomas_sankara_murdered_29_years_ago

Photo by Cannabis Culture | CC BY 2.0 O n a recent segment of Democracy Now, Tess Borden made an impassioned plea for the U.S. 'ì both federal and state governments 'î to end the criminal prosecution of those possessing or using illegal drugs. 
Quoting from a new report from the ACLU and Human Rights Watch (HRW), ' Every 25 Seconds: The Human Toll of Criminalizing Drug Use in the United States ,' Borden observed, 'Every 25 seconds someone is arrested for possessing drugs for their own use, amounting to 1.25 million arrests per year.' She reminded her audience, 'These numbers tell a tale of ruined lives, destroyed families, and communities suffering under a suffocating police presence.' 
The study is an impressive piece of rigorous research and analysis as well as a statement of moral conviction: it's a political call to decriminalize all personal drug use. It paints a devastating portrait of not simply the nation's failed anti-drug policy, but reveals it to be a mean-spirited, moralistic 'ì and racist 'î program of social repression. 
Among the study's key findings are: 
' Yes, every 25 seconds someone in the U.S. is arrested for the simple act of possessing drugs for their personal use. 
' Sadly, more than 1.25 million people are arrested each year for drug possession 'ì this is more than for any other crime. 
' More than one of every nine arrests by state law enforcement is for drug possession 'î four times more people are arrested for possessing drugs as for selling them. 
' There are at least 137,000 men and women imprisoned for drug possession 'î 48,000 in state pens and 89,000 in local jails (most in pretrial detention). 
' This population consists predominantly of inner-city dwellers 'ì African-American and Hispanic and largely youthful offenders. 
' In 42 states, possession of small amounts of most illicit drugs other than marijuana is either always or sometimes a felony offense; only eight states and the District of Columbia make possession of small amounts a misdemeanor. 
' State rates of arrest for drug possession range from 700 per 100,000 people in Maryland to 77 per 100,000 in Vermont. 
A bust every 25 seconds adds up. As the study reminds readers, 'tens of thousands [of people] are convicted, cycle through jails and prisons, and spend extended periods on probation and parole, often burdened with crippling debt from court-imposed fines and fees.' 
The study makes clear that the war-on-drugs is a punitive, vindictive form of policing, criminal justice and imprisonment. It's easy to be tough on those involved in mostly a victimless crime, drug use. Cops pick the easiest target, notably inner-city minority youth (i.e., 'Stop and Frisk') and, increasingly, rural white youth; prosecutors show off how tough they are by 'throwing the book' at some hapless soul; and judges get easily re-elected for being tough on drug criminals, especially people of color and repeat offenders. 
The study makes clear that the war-on-drugs is a failure in terms of public policy and the toll it takes on those suffocated by the drug war effort. Unfortunately, the study suffers from not pushing its inherent argument one critical step further 'ì acknowledging that the police-court-jail system that manages the drug war is a racket, the domestic corollary to the military-industrial complex that Pres. Dwight Eisenhower identified a half-century ago. 
*** 
A lmost a century ago, the U.S. adopted the 18 th Amendment establishing abstinence as the law of the land. Prohibition was inforce for 13 years and was a failure, flaunted by many and leading to wide-scale corruption of law enforcement and politicians. It was formally terminated with the adoption of the 21 st Amendment in 1933 as the Depression mounted. Now, nearly a century after Prohibition was proven a failure, we may be witnessing the end to the criminalization of personal drug use. 
In the wake of the failure of Prohibition, the U.S. Congress enacted the Marijuana Tax Act in 1937, effectively criminalized marijuana use. Three decades later, in 1971, Pres. Richard Nixon formally launched the 'war on drugs,' transforming a relatively obscure local 'ì and very private 'ì issue into a national concern. He dramatically increased the size and presence of federal drug control agencies; he promoted mandatory sentencing and no-knock warrants; he also placed marijuana in Schedule One, the most restrictive category of drugs; and he called for a national commission to study the drug problem and recommend appropriate policies. 
In 1972, Nixon's drug-policy commission 'î the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, the Shafer Commission 'î unanimously recommended decriminalizing the possession and distribution of marijuana for personal use. Nixon furiously rejected its recommendations. And the war-on-drugs has barreled on for the last four decades. 
As the Watergate scandal undermined Nixon's presidency, New York Governor, Nelson Rockefeller launched his presidential campaign in 1973 with a call to toughen the state's drug laws. He upped the war against drugs, calling for mandatory prison sentences of 15 years to life for drug dealers and addicts 'î even those caught with small amounts of marijuana, cocaine or heroin. In the wake of Nixon's resignation, Rockefeller became Vice President and his signature effort was to implement his war on drugs as a national campaign. 
The punitive anti-drug policy was further strengthened by Pres. Ronald Reagan, leading to a massive increase in incarceration rates. The Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) estimates that in 1980, '50,000 people were incarcerated for violating nonviolent drug law but by 1997 the number increased to over 400,000 people.' In 1981, Nancy Reagan proclaimed a new era in the anti-drug wars, championing ' Just Say No .' 
The DPA also notes that during the mid- to late-1980s, the nation experienced a near-hysterical rage over the alleged threat of illegal drugs. It points out that public opinion polls in 1985 found only about 2-6 percent of Americans saw drug abuse as the nation's 'number one problem'; however, by September 1989 two-thirds of those polled (64%) considered drugs as the nation's leading problem. It adds, 'Within less than a year [1990], however, the figure plummeted to less than 10 percent, as the media lost interest.' 
A quarter-century later, the drug scene has changed. During the '50s-'70s, hipsters and hippies, white and black, smoking the evil weed. In the '80s, a 'crack cocaine scare' gripped the nation following the adoption of the infamous Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1986); the Act made penalties 100 times harsher for crack than for powder cocaine convictions and 85 percent of those jailed for crack cocaine offenses were black, despite the fact that the majority of users were white. 
Americans love to get high. In 2013, the 'legal' drug of choice was alcohol, where nearly three-fifths (58%) were drinkers and nearly a quarter (24%) binge drinkers. The use of tobacco products (e.g., cigarettes, cigars) among whites is still over one-quarter (28%). An estimated 25 million Americans were using illicit drugs, about 9.4 percent of the population aged 12 or older; this is up to from the 2002-09 rate of 7.9 percent. The drugs used were marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants and prescription-type psychotherapeutics. 
Marijuana was Americans favorite means of getting high, accounting for four-fifths (81%) of illicit drug users, about 20 million users per month. Among full-time college students, whites have the highest rate of illegal drug use at 25 percent. 
Methamphetamine ('meth') was once the drug of choice among white males (e.g., outlaw motorcycle gangs and blue-collar guys) and remains so, but is losing its appeal. In the '90s at the height of its popularity, the Open Society estimates there were only one million meth users. Today, its use has spread to white women and Hispanics. Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health reported that between 2002-2005 and 2008-2011 there was a 75 percent jump in heroin usage among 'Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites.' 
T he new drugs of choice among Americans are psychotherapeutic drugs and heroine. A 2010 report from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that, during 2009, 2.4 million individuals used psycho drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants and sedatives used for nonmedical purposes. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 'Adolescent girls and women older than 35 years have significantly greater rates of abuse and dependence on psychotherapeutic drugs than men.'
More troubling, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), overdoses (i.e., 'drug poisoning') are 'the number one cause of injury-related death in the United States, with 43,982 deaths occurring in 2013.' It found, based on data from 28 states, that the 'death rate for heroin overdose doubled from 2010 through 2012.' Drilling down, it found there were 8,257 heroine deaths, most involving men aged 25'ì44 years. 
*** 
No one knows how much money has been spent to fight the failed war-on-drugs. According to a DPA estimate , 'Over the past four decades, federal and state governments have poured over $1 trillion into drug war spending and relied on taxpayers to foot the bill.' It adds: 'Money funneled into drug enforcement has meant less funding for more serious crime and has left essential education, health, social service and public safety programs struggling to operate on meager funding.' 
The Drug War Facts website provides a detailed breakdown on annual federal spending on the war-on-drugs for 2013-'17. It estimates for Fiscal Year 2016, the federal government will spend $30.6 billion. A third source, the Drug War Clock , estimates that federal spending is about 60 percent of that spent by states (i.e., $49 billion); total spending for the false war-on-drugs at about $75 billion. 
The expenditures associated with the war-on-drugs are, like the military-industrial complex, a vast slush fund with costs covering a very wide assortment of federal, state and local 'ì both government and private 'î services and fees. Among these expenditures are: 
' Costs of policing, from the border guards to the cop-on-the-block; 
' Costs of prosecutors, courts and defense attorneys; 
' Costs for prisons, jails and probation. 
These areas of expenditures do not itemize the directs costs for employment, facilities and upkeep (e.g., food, medical) let alone the profits garnered by private corporations to operate the vast infrastructure required to wage the war-on-drugs. 
Nor do these expenditures included the $1 trillion that Americans spent on illegal substances between 2000 and 2010. In a 2012 study for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, Rand estimated the market for four illicit drugs 'î cocaine (including crack), heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine (meth) 'ì at $100 billion for only one year, 2010. It noted, 'This figure has been stable over the decade, but there have been important shifts in the drugs being purchased.' 
With a $100 billion in illegal drug money sloshing through the economy each year, one can only wonder how much of it goes to corruption pay-offs, to law enforcement officials who look the other way. As experienced during Prohibition, the enormous cash generated by the illegal drug trade leads to endemic corruption. 
Finally, as the ACLU and HRW study painfully makes clear, many, many peoples' lives are destroyed for the possession on illegal drugs. Unfortunately, it doesn't mention the way questionable law-enforcement officials, like the notorious Brooklyn NYPD detective Louis Scarcella and former DA Charles Hynes, exploited drug busts to further their careers. (New York has paid more than $100 million to wrongfully convicted victims of their arrests and prosecutions.) 
Its time to embrace the ACLU and HRW's call to end the criminal prosecution of those who possess or use an 'illegal' substance. Like alcohol, its needs to integrated into the market economy and, like alcohol, effectively regulated in terms of quality and age-of-use. Sadly, like the military-industrial complex, to many corporations, unions and people with influence have too much invested in the war-on-drugs to see it end.

shorty BY REV. WILLIAM ALBERTS T he common humanity everyone shares should be the epicenter of the moral universe. Not religion. Our religious founders and saints have different beginnings and beliefs, but all of us share similar birth stories, and at the moment of birth we are most alike. We have different faith traditions, but the same universal need to be loved and to love. We speak different languages, but laugh alike. We don't look alike, but our facial expressions tell the same story 'ì of surprise and pleasure, frustration and anger, joy and sadness. We sing different anthems 'î with the same pride. We may regard each other as foreigners, yet we love and grieve the same. Anywhere in the world, when people are oppressed, their innate human response is to struggle for justice. Everyone bleeds human. Thus the common humanity all people share is the frame of reference for the moral universe. And our common humanity is powerfully expressed in most religions' shared belief in The Golden Rule: 'So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.' (Matthew 7: 12) But, to everyone's endangerment, political and faith leaders alike are redefining and thus shrinking the moral universe to accommodate their self-interests. Their selective morality is especially seen in today's presidential campaign. For many white evangelical Christians, morality takes a back seat to belief. Jesus is recorded as teaching, 'I was a stranger and you welcomed me.' (Matthew 25: 36), and 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' (Matthew 22: 39). Yet a high majority of evangelicals and their leaders have had no problem supporting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, despite his denigration of women, Mexicans, Muslims, immigrants, black persons and even a disabled reporter. In fact, a number of evangelical Christian leaders have formed a Faith Advisory Council to help guide Trump's presidential campaign, and evangelical ministers are repeatedly photographed surrounding him and laying their hands on him in prayer. It is about their religious beliefs, not his immoral behavior. Numerous white evangelical Christian leaders have an unwavering faith in Donald Trump. Recently, a video showed an 'aroused' Trump boasting about being a compulsive sexual predator, who is 'automatically attracted to beautiful . . . I just start kissing them . . . It's like a magnet . . . I don't even wait. And when you're a star . . . you can do anything' to them, including, 'grab them by the pussy.' ('US election: Full transcript of Donald Trump's obscene videotape', BBC News , Oct. 8, 2016) Ironically, in the second presidential debate, shortly before the video surfaced, Donald Trump told Hillary Clinton that, as president, he would have a special prosecutor investigate her misuse of emails when Secretary of State, and said to her, 'You'd be in jail.' Actually, Trump's self-reported sexual assaults on women indicate he should be prosecuted, and jailed if found guilty 'ì and, when released, be registered as a sex offender 'ì for the protection of unsuspecting women. While the leaked videotape has led some white evangelical Christian supporters to distance themselves from Donald Trump's campaign, many others still support him, believing that he will 'make America great again' 'î to their Biblical liking . Typical is Ralph Reed, leader of Trump's religious advisory board and founder and chair of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. The father of two daughters, Reed was reported as being 'disappointed by' Trump's ' 'Inappropriate' comments.' But Reed said, 'I think a 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their [evangelical voters] hierarchy of their concerns.' He stated that, 'people of faith are voting on issues like who will protect unborn life, defend religious freedom, grow the economy, appoint conservative judges and oppose the Iran nuclear deal.' (' 'Still the best candidate': Some evangelicals still back Trump despite lewd video,' By Sarah Pulliam Bailey, The Washington Post , Oct. 8, 2016) For Ralph Reed and many other evangelical Christian leaders and their flocks, it is the authority of their selective Biblical beliefs. The Bible says, 'So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.' (Genesis 1: 27) Therefore, these evangelical leaders believe that unborn American children are more worthy of protection than already born Muslim children and adults 'ì who are protected, by 'the Iran nuclear deal,' from another falsely-based, Iraqi-type, pre-emptive U.S. invasion. The aim of evangelical Christian leaders is not just to protect the unborn, but to proselytize those already born, especially Muslims. Thus a reported '87 percent of all white evangelical Christians in the United States supported' the George W. Bush Administration's illegal pre-emptive invasion of defenseless Iraq 'î certain evangelical leaders even 'claiming that the American invasion of Iraq would create exciting new prospects for proselytizing Muslims.' ('Wayward Christian Soldiers, By Charles Marsh, The New York Times , Jan. 20, 2006) In the wake of that devastating criminal war, certain evangelical groups, like Muslim-hating Rev. Franklin Graham and his Samaritan's Purse organization, flocked to Iraq to join the 'humanitarian effort,' with the motivation to harvest for Jesus the Muslims fortunate enough to survive the slaughter. Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations said of this obscenely immoral reality: 'Franklin Graham obviously thinks it is a war against Islam. . . . This is a guy who gave the invocation at President Bush's inauguration and believes Islam is a wicked faith. And,' Hooper questioned, 'he's going into Iraq in the wake of an invading army and convert people to Christianity? Nothing good is coming from that.' ('Group to Aid, Proselytize in Postwar Iraq,' By Deborah Caldwell, ABC News , March 27, 2003) Nothing good came out of that worst war crime of the 21 st century. It merely provided another tragic example of the fact that 'American exceptionalism' and belief that Jesus is 'the savior of the world' are two sides of the same imperialistic coin. For many evangelical Christians, it is about belief, not behavior. It is about Psalm 139: 'For you created my innermost being: you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.' (verses 13, 14) It is about, 'You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.' (Leviticus 18: 25) And Jesus is reported as saying to Pharisees, 'Have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning made them male and female. . . . For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh?' (Matthew 19: 4, 5) Abortion, homosexuality and same-sex marriage are all an 'abomination.' It is one's birth that counts, Not the circumstances surrounding pregnancy and birth. Nor the individual's 'innermost being' after birth. Especially not one's ' innermost being' leading one to 'leave father and mother and be joined' in love to one's same-sex partner. Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence is a classic example of the Biblically-shrunken moral universe of many evangelical Christians. In his debate with Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Tim Kaine, Pence said, 'For me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief . . . where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you and so . . . I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.' ('The most important exchanges of the vice presidential debate, annotated,' LA Times , Oct. 4, 2016) 'The sanctity of life' before a child is born. As governor of Indiana, Mike Pence signed a 'Religious Freedom Restoration Act' that, as reported, 'would have allowed businesses to refuse service to LGBT customers, for example, by citing their religious beliefs.' That legislation cost Indiana dearly in lost revenue from the boycott of celebrities and conventions that cancelled their planned appearances and meetings in the state. Documented is Pence's consistent opposition to 'marriage equality,' his opposition to 'protecting LGBT employees,' and his refusal to support 'LGBT-inclusive hate-crimes legislation.' ('Donald Trump Clearly Didn't 'Ask the Gays' About Mike Pence,' By Advocate.com Editors/Authors, advocate.com , July 15, 2016) For Pence, 'the sanctity of life' ends at birth. It is about belief in the inerrancy of The Bible 'ì which then becomes the epicenter of the moral universe for word-for-word- Bible -believing Christians. Here one finds certainty and authority, which allow one to seek to convert other persons to one's true beliefs, rather than engage with them, and the truths they live by, as equals. Thus for such Bible -believing Christians, it is not about loving your neighbor as yourself as Jesus taught, but wanting your neighbor to be like yourself. The Bible allows them to act out their need to gain power over and control other persons 'ì and allay their own innermost anxieties and doubts. The Bible is often used by people to avoid understanding why they behave as they do. Forgiveness covers a multitude of sins, and while liberating one from conscious guilt, may provide little self-insight into one's behavior. Unquestioning belief in 'the 'Word of God' allows those with anti-introspective tendencies to dismiss scientifically-based psychological knowledge of human development and behavior that contradicts the Source of their authority. This belief allows them to dumb down their God to accommodate their cultural conditioning and rationalizations. Again, the words of Republican vice-presidential candidate Mike Pence are revealing. After Donald Trump gave a brief automatic apology for his sexually abusive behavior toward women in that videotape, Pence used words of faith to make Trump's compulsive criminal behavior disappear. ' 'We all fall short of the glory of God,' ' Pence said, 'and praised Trump for his 'humility' in asking forgiveness.' Pence continued, 'It takes a big man to know when he is wrong and to admit it and to have the humility to apologize and be transparent and be vulnerable with people. . . . Donald Trump last night showed that he is a big man.' ('Pence: Trump showed 'humility' with apology,' By Jessie Hellmann, TheHill , Oct. 10, 2016) In a New Hampshire campaign speech, which was greatly lauded by mainstream media, Michelle Obama said entirely different words regarding Donald Trump's lewd video boasts about sexually assaulting women. While effectively denouncing Trump's self-professed criminal behavior toward women, she took the occasion to declare that the epicenter of the moral universe is America and that Hillary Clinton possesses the moral compass. 'Shaken to my core' by Trump's 'lewd comments,' Mrs. Obama emphasized that, 'the measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls.' Then, referring to Trump, she said, 'We have a candidate for President of the United States who . . . last week . . . [was] actually bragging about sexually assaulting women. . . . The disrespect of our ambitions and intellect. The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman.' ('Read Michelle Obama's Speech Condemning Donald Trump's Comments About Women,' By Katie Reilly, motto.time.com , Oct. 13, 2016) Michelle Obama then pivoted to Hillary Clinton's presidential candidacy, saying, 'I believe with all my heart that Hillary Clinton will be that president . . . who truly cares about us and our children.' Thus, she said, 'If we let Hillary's opponent win this election . . . we won't be just setting a bad example for our kids, but for our entire world. Because, 'she added, ' for so long America has been a model for countries across the globe, pushing them to educate their girls, insisting they give more rights to their women.' She called America 'the greatest nation on earth,' and also stated, 'We have the power to show our children that America's greatness comes from recognizing the inherent dignity and worth of all our people.' ( Ibid ) 'The measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls.' How about: the measure of any society is also how it treats the women and girls in other societies ? That measure goes to the heart of The Golden Rule and the epicenter of the moral universe. And with that inclusiveness as the measure, Hillary Clinton fails miserably. If 'the measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls,' Iraq was measuring up comparably well. Under Saddam Hussein's rule, Iraq's education system was reported to be 'top notch and female literacy rates were the highest in the region.' In fact, 'education was a major priority for Saddam Hussein's regime, so much so that in 1982 Iraq received . . . the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) award for eradicating illiteracy.' Furthermore, 'Women were integral to Iraq's economy and held high positions in both the private and public sectors, thanks in large part to labor and employment laws that guaranteed equal pay, six months fully paid maternity leave and protection from sexual harassment . . . conditions enjoyed by working women in Iraq rival[ing] those of working women in the United States.' ('Was Life for Iraqi Women Better Under Saddam?,' By Rania Khalek, muftah.org , March 19, 2013) Also reported, 'Iraq had one of the best national health care systems in the Middle East. . . . and the Iraqi people enjoyed one of the highest standards of living in the Middle East.' ('Living Conditions in Iraq: A Criminal Tragedy,' by Ghali Hassan, globalresearch.ca , June 3, 2005) Then came the devastating U.S.-controlled UN economic sanctions that resulted in the deaths of over 500,000 Iraqi children under five years of age. Following those murderous sanctions, the George W. Bush administration, with the support of then Senator Hillary Clinton, launched an illegal, falsely-based pre-emptive was against defenseless Iraq. That unnecessary criminal war killed over a million Iraqi civilians, left some two million Iraqi women widowed, and an estimated five million girls and boys orphaned. ('Was life for Iraqi Women Better Under Saddam?,' Ibid) And loved ones are grieving for almost 5,000 American troops killed and over 100,000 wounded in body and mind. In response to this carnage, Hillary Clinton said her vote for the invasion of Iraq was a 'mistake' 'ì as she announced her candidacy for president in the 2016 campaign. And with her candidacy, she cites her 'lifelong commitment to fighting for children and families,' saying, 'I've spent my life fighting for children, families and our country and I'm not stopping now.' ('Documentary Style Ad Features Hillary Clinton's Lifelong Record Fighting for Children and Families, hillaryclinton.com ) With her presidential campaign supported by American Iraq war hawks, nothing may stop her from continuing to destroy 'children and families' in other societies. (See, 'Neocon War Hawks Want Hillary Clinton Over Donald Trump. No Surprise 'ì They've Always Backed Her,' By Branko Marcetic, inthesetimes.com , March 23, 2016) It is the same story with Libya. If 'the measure of a society is how it treats its women and girls,' Libya excelled. According to Harvard researcher Dr. Garikai Chengu, 'Gaddafi's Libya was Africa's most prosperous democracy.' Concerning women, Chengu writes 'The United Nations Human Rights Council praised Mr. Gaddafi profusely [for] women's rights.' They included 'the right to education, hold jobs, divorce, hold property' and 'equal pay for equal work.' Plus, 'Libyan working mothers enjoyed a range of benefits including cash bonuses for children, free day care, free health care centers and retirement at 55.' Education was a human right and it was free for all Libyans. And 'health care was a human right.' ('Gaddafi's Libya was Africa's Most Prosperous Democracy,' Foreign Policy Journal , Jan. 12, 2013) Dr. Chengu states that 'prior to Colonel Gaddafi, King Idris let Standard Oil essentially write Libya's petroleum laws. Mr. Gaddafi put an end to all of that.' He deposited the 'money from oil proceeds . . . directly into every Libyan citizen's bank account.' Chengu muses: 'One wonders if Exxon Mobil and British Petroleum will continue this practice under the new democratic Libya?' He also asks: 'With regard to health care, education and economic justice, is America in any position to export democracy to Libya or should America have taken a leaf out of Libya's book?' He then adds this commentary: 'Therefore, isn't it ironic that America supposedly bombarded Libya to spread democracy, but increasingly education in America is becoming a privilege, not a right, and ultimately a debt sentence.' ( Ibid ) Col. Gaddafi himself looked at the invasion and plunder of Iraq, and saw the handwriting on America's imperialistic wall. He wrote, 'They want to do to Libya what they did to Iraq and what they are itching to do to Iran. They want to take back the oil that was nationalized by these countries' revolutions.' And, 'They want to re-establish military bases that were shut down by the revolutions and to install client regimes that will subordinate the country's wealth and labor to imperialistic corporate interests. All else is lies and deception.' ('Facts about Libya under Gaddafi that you probably did not know about!,' By mystory2323, ireport.cnn.com , Nov. 21, 2012) The rights and prosperity enjoyed by woman and girls 'ì and everyone else 'ì in Libya was enough to threaten any capitalistic society. Col. Gaddafi had to go. And, as reported, Hillary Clinton played a key role in his overthrow and death. In his article, 'Benghazi Won't Stick to Hillary Clinton, But the Disastrous Libyan Intervention Should,' foreign policy journalist Joel Gillin writes that, as Secretary of State, she helped to convince President Obama that a 'humanitarian intervention' 'î in the form of military force was needed 'to stop the imminent slaughter of civilians in Benghazi' 'ì the intervention opposed by Robert Gates, then Secretary of Defense, 'and other top national security officials.' Gillin states that 'no solid evidence existed to back up Clinton's statements of the impending bloodbath in Benghazi.' ( New Republic, May 27, 2015) (See also, 'Even Critics understate how catastrophically bad the Hillary Clinton-led NATO bombing of Libya was,' By Ben Norton, salon.com , Mar. 2, 2016) In his article, 'Who said Gaddafi had to go?,' Hugh Roberts, professor of North African History, wrote that the decision 'was to declare Gaddafi guilty in advance of a massacre of defenseless civilians and instigate a process of destroying his regime and him (and his family) by way of punishment of a crime he was yet to commit, and actually unlikely to commit, and to persist with this process despite his repeated offers to suspend military action.' Ironically, Roberts states, it was the U.S.-led NATO forces that committed a 'blood bath' against the Libyan people, not Muammar Gaddafi. Possibly 25,000 Libyans were killed, 'many thousands injured and hundreds of thousands . . . displaced.' ( London Review of Books , Nov. 17, 2011) How many of those victims were women and girls? Afterwards, Secretary of State Clinton appeared on television, and in response to the news of the toppling of Col. Gaddafi's government and his brutal death, she laughed and chuckled, 'We came, we saw, and he died!' ('See Flashback 2011: Hillary Clinton Laughs About Killing Muammar Gaddafi: 'We Came, We Saw, He Died!',' realclearpolitics.com , Posted June 19, 2015) That shocking television scene provides insight into her circumscribed morality. 'The measure of a society is how it treats its women and girls.' Tell that to the Palestinian people. Hillary Clinton repeatedly says that 'women's rights are human rights.' But in her mind, that does not apply to Palestinian women and girls. In an article, 'Hillary Clinton Is No Feminist: Just Look at Her Stance on Palestine,' Nadia Elia, Diaspora Palestinian writer and political commentator, quotes 'a young Palestinian student, Layali Awwad,' who, in a letter to Clinton, wrote, 'When you choose to speak about my homeland, not once do you mention Israel's human rights violations against Palestinian women and children.' Elia continues, 'In 2014, Clinton again expressed full support for Israel as it was engaging in a massive military assault on Gaza,' whereas 'even the mainstream US media, while otherwise supportive of Israel, repeatedly commented on the disproportionate number of women and children killed by Israeli fire.' And when a journalist asked Clinton 'about the bombing of a UN school where homeless civilians had taken shelter, she began with her formulaic 'Israel has the right to defend itself' reply.' Elia states that, 'fifteen people were killed in that bombing and more than 100 injured, but to her 'women and children' were merely a complication.' ( commondreams.com , Aug. 8, 2016) To Hillary Clinton, 'the measure of how a society treats its women and children' does not apply to how the occupying Israeli power treats Palestinian women and children. Nada Elia sums up Clinton's moral blind spot this way: 'We can go back to every instance of Israel violating international law and the human rights of Palestinians and Clinton will invariably be on the side of the oppressor, the illegal occupier, the racist regime. This is not what feminism is about.' Elia then says, 'Feminism is not only concerned with women and children, but also seeks to eliminate various systems of structural violence. And,' she states, 'while the examples above are from Palestine, we can look elsewhere, around the globe to see how detrimental her hawkish political interventions have proven, from Pakistan to Libya, Honduras and beyond.' ( Ibid ) There is also the Clinton campaign's demonizing of President Putin, and linking him as favoring Donald Trump's candidacy. And the campaign's attempt to deflect the revelation of Hillary Clinton's dishonesty, revealed in her emails, leaked by WikiLeaks: by alleging, without documented proof, that the emails were hacked by the Russians to influence the U.S. election on behalf of Trump's campaign. Echoes of McCarthyism and the 'Communist scare?' Never mind that the emails reveal a two-faced Clinton, telling bankers in private, who paid her around $225,000 for a speech, that they can count on her, and saying to voters in public what she believes they want to hear. Donald Trump's crime is his compulsion to sexually assault individual women. If he obtains the power of the presidency, his delusions of grandeur, paranoia, distortion of reality and impulsiveness would be boundlessly destructive. Hillary Clinton's crime is her compulsion to militarily assault whole countries. As president, she would continue America's imperialistic global war on terrorism, with countless more women and girls at risk. In 2005, the United Methodist News Service reported that a delegation of five United Methodist Bishops paid a 'pastoral visit' to President George W. Bush at the White House. They 'presented Bush, a fellow United Methodist, with a Bible signed by the Council of Bishops, and they shared a moment of prayer with him.' Their 'pastoral visit' also included 'telling the president . . . they shared his commitment to building a better world.' ('United Methodist bishops meet with president, open door to future,' by Tim Tanton, archives.gcah.org , May 3, 2005) Bush continued his devastating criminal war against Iraq. Later, United Methodist leaders built him a monument (The George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum) on the campus of Southern Methodist University. If Hillary Clinton, a United Methodist, is elected president, beware of a delegation of proud United Methodist Bishops, with Bible in hand, visiting her at the White House. For many United Methodist leaders, the epicenter of the universe is power, not morality. The election is rigged, but not in the way Donald Trump repeatedly charges. It is rigged by the Democratic and Republican parties, and the corporate media, to limit our choices to their two immoral presidential candidates. Neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton is worthy of one's vote. The moral universe encircles all women and girls, and all men and boys 'ì everywhere .

[Photo: Mateo Renzi (2013) by Sailko ] Ramzy Baroud, PhD Politics for the People Editor's Note Renzi is just one more politician who blatantly panders to Israeli leadership at the expense of their responsibilities to citizenry nor organizations. And to what end? Do they want Israel to smile on them? No. The want the U.S. to smile on them. Think for 10 seconds on what that means for U.S. policy. D id Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, actually read the full text of the UNESCO resolution on Palestine and Israel, before he raved with anger ? 'I think this is a mistaken, inconceivable resolution,' he said. 'It is not possible to continue with these resolutions at the UN and UNESCO that aim to attack Israel. It is shocking and I have ordered that we stop taking this position (his country's abstention) even if it means diverging from the position taken by the rest of Europe,' he added. Renzi, who became Prime Minister in 2014 at the relatively young age of 39 knows exactly how the game is played. In order to win favor with Washington, he must first please Tel Aviv. 
His country has abstained from the October 12 vote on a resolution that condemns Israel's violations of the cultural and legal status of Occupied East Jerusalem. This decision has ignited the ire of Israeli Ambassador to Rome, Ofer Zaks , who riled up the Jewish community in Italy to protest the abstention. Renzi, in turn, was converted into a champion of the 'Temple Mount', the name Israel uses to describe the Palestinian Muslim holy site. 
Renzi cravenly went on damage control mode without truly understanding the nature of the resolution, which merely condemned Israel's obvious violations of international law, and only calls for Israel to respect the status of Palestinian culture in the occupied city. 
None of procedures that led to the vote on the UNESCO's resolution 'ì voted by 24-6, with 26 abstentions 'ì violated protocol, nor was any of the wording inconsistent with international law. In fact, UNESCO was merely doing its job: attempting to protect and preserve the historical and cultural heritage of the world. Jerusalem is a sacred and a holy city to a majority of humanity, simply because it is significant to the spiritual wellbeing of the adherents of the three monotheistic religions. In fact, the resolution stated so : 'Affirming the importance of the Old City of Jerusalem and its Walls for the three monotheistic religions '¶' Renzi's outburst is quite disappointing, to say the least, for the young, eager politician simply tried to score cheap political points with Israel 'ì thus the United States 'ì without a full, or even partial comprehension of what the UNESCO resolution resolved. Nor did he seem aware of the fact that such text is largely a repeat of what has been discussed by the world's leading cultural organization in April, and repeatedly before that date. 'If anyone wants to say something about Israel, let them say it, but they should not use UNESCO'¶ To say that the Jews have no links to Jerusalem is like saying the sun creates darkness,' he said, paraphrasing the sentiment displayed by the Israeli Prime Minister. It would be rather sad if Renzi sees a mentor in Benjamin Netanyahu, for the latter is one of the least liked world leaders who has made a mockery of international forums and derided the United Nations itself as anti-Semitic and its process as 'theater of the absurd'. This is what Netanyahu had said in response to the resolution and shortly before he suspended his country's membership in UNESCO. Using a language that is as amusing as his cartoon depiction of the Iranian nuclear bomb in his famous UN spectacle in 2012, he said: 'To say that Israel has no connection to the Temple Mount and the Western Wall is like saying that China has no connection to the Great Wall of China or that Egypt has no connection to the Pyramids.' Other Israeli officials followed suit with a chorus of denunciations, included Israeli President, Reuven Rivilin, who described the decision as an 'embarrassment' for UNESCO. Culture Minister, Miri Regev, cut to the chase, by labeling the resolution 'shameful and anti-Semitic.' In fact, it was neither. In addition to Renzi's odd reaction, the United States and other western governments reacted with exaggerated anger, again without even addressing the situation on the ground , which prompted the resolution 'ì and numerous other UN resolutions in the past 'ì in the first place. Even the Czech parliament jumped on board , voting to condemn what they described as a 'hateful, anti-Israel' sentiment.' I have read the resolution repeatedly to pinpoint the specific text that could possibly be understood by Israel's friends as hateful, to no avail. The entirety of the text was based on past international conventions, resolutions, international law, and refers to Israel as the Occupying Power, as per the diktat of the Geneva Conventions. The Italian, Czech, American anger is, of course, misdirected and is largely political theater. But, of course, there is an important context that they refuse to address. Israel is working diligently to appropriate Muslim and Christian heritage in East Jerusalem, a city that is designated by international law as illegally occupied. The Israeli army and police have restricted the movement of Palestinian worshipers and is excavating under the foundation of the third holiest Muslim shrine, Haram al-Sharif, in search of a mythological Temple. In the process of doing so, numerous Palestinians, trying to defend their Mosque from the attacks staged by Israeli occupation forces and extremist Jewish groups, have been killed. How is UNESCO to react to this? The resolution merely, 'called on Israel' to 'allow for the restoration of the historic status quo that prevailed until September 2000, under which the Jordanian Awqaf (Religious Foundation) Department exercised exclusive authority on Al-Aq·π£a Mosque/Al-·∏§aram Al-Sharif.' Moreover, it 'stressed', the 'urgent need of the implementation of the UNESCO reactive monitoring mission to the Old City of Jerusalem and its Walls.' Where is the 'hate' and 'Anti-Semitism' in that? Israel's anger is, of course, fathomable. For nearly fifty years, following the illegal occupation and annexation of the Palestinian Arab city, Israel has done everything it could possibly do to strip the city of its universal appeal and Arab heritage, and make it exclusive to Jews only 'ì thus the slogan of Jerusalem being Israel's 'eternal and undivided capital.' Israel is angry because, after five decades of ceaseless efforts, neither UNESCO nor other UN institutions will accept Israel's practices and designations. In 2011, following the admission of 'Palestine' as a member state, Israel ranted and raved as well, resulting in the US cutting off funding to UNESCO. The latest resolution indicates that Israel and the US have utterly failed to coerce UNESCO. What also caused much fury in Tel Aviv is that UNESCO used the Arabic references to Haram al-Sharif, Al-Aqsa Mosque and other Muslim religious and heritage sites. The same way they would refer to Egypt's Pyramids of Giza and China's Great Wall by their actual names. Hardly anti-Semitic. Since its establishment atop Palestinian towns and village, Israel has been on a mission to rename everything Arabic with Hebrew alternatives . Recent years have seen a massive push towards the Judaization of Arab Christian and Muslim sites, streets and holy shrines, a campaign spear-headed by the Israeli right and ultranationalist groups. To expect UNESCO to employ such language is what should strike as 'absurd'. Not only should the UNESCO resolution be respected, it should also be followed by practical mechanisms to implement its recommendations. Israel, an Occupying Power should not be given a free pass to besiege the holy shrines of two major world religions, restrict the movement and attack worshipers, annex occupied territories and destroy what is essential spiritual heritage that belongs to the whole world.

Sabia Rigby Editor's Note The fact that the refugee encampment is called 'The Jungle' speaks volumes for how those who must stay there are perceived '¶ and treated. Calais has been home to a United Nations of refugees. The poem above (and picture) are from a Palestinian man. The quote below a Libyan, many others as presented in this article. Where do they go? Where will new refugees go? You read this, hear the voices, and then shake your head at the xenophobic response of the US (at the heart of creation of millions of refugees) who say 'You have no home with us 'ì not even those of you who have sacrificed and served under our banner.' There are times when the shame of my nation is almost too much to bear. 
'I was in jail with a Libyan man, his friends came and broke into the jail and let us go, too. There was fighting everywhere. You pray to be in jail with Libyans, because they do not recognize the current government, they will do what they want.' (spoken by a refugee in 'the Jungle') F orty-two percent of the people who came to the Jungle are from warring parts of Sudan and South Sudan; thirty-two percent are from Afghanistan. Others are from Syria, Yemen, Iraqi Kurdistan, Pakistan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Egypt, and more; they have crossed between 6 and 13 countries to arrive in Calais, with their final goal to reach the U.K. In Calais, it seems they are facing the hardest border to cross.
There are many who have died or been seriously injured in their attempts to cross the border to the U.K. One couple was trying to cross by train. Her boyfriend made it on; she leapt, wrapped her arms around him, but did not get her bottom half onto the train. She was cut in half. He was deeply traumatized by her tragic death. In another case, a brother and sister tried to cross to the U.K. by truck. They were both hit on the road; he died and she is in the hospital. Most people from the Jungle Camp who are in the hospital were wounded in accidents while trying to get into the U.K. Broken bones and deep cuts on arms, legs, and fingers are the most commonly suffered injuries. Volunteer teams have been visiting refugees; we have had as many as sixteen to visit each time, and during a normal week we visit twice a week. We take food and toiletries and, for those we have come to know, we try and bring a small gift. Last week we spent time in the Jungle relaying information to each community. First, the Calais government won the right to shut down any place of business in the Jungle: restaurants, barber shops, vegetable stalls, and cigarette shops. Second, anyone continuing to work in the businesses can and will be arrested. With the help of others from over twenty organizations, including L'Auberge des Immigrants, Secour Catholique, Refugee Youth Center and The Migrants' Law Project, we shared pamphlets containing information about the legal rights each person has in case they do get arrested and or harassed. The legal rights information was translated and printed into Arabic, English, Amharic, Farsi and Pashtu. 
The Jungle camp was supposed to be demolished on the 17 th of October. Instead, the government moved the date to the 24 th because that would give them 'time' to figure out what to do with the unaccompanied minors. The idea is to register as many minors as possible. Some young people have been waiting more than a year to reunite with family. One volunteer likened the process to a child doing homework on the bus to class, after having weeks to get it done. 
On the 24 th registration lines were put into place: minors, families, vulnerable people suffering from physical and mental problems, and lastly those who wish to seek asylum in France all lined up. The government thought they would register 3000, but they only managed 1200 registrations. Today, both French and English police are supposed to begin taking down all the dwellings in the Jungle. They have begun destroying dwellings in the Sudanese quarter. The registration lines will continue until further notice. 
We asked minors we have come to know about their registration process. Many have registered and are staying in the containers; the containers are supposed to be spared from demolition. One of the children I have grown close to suffers from severe anxiety. Daily, I am reminded of his journey to Calais and the horrors he faced in Libya when his terrors began. The lines are too long; he did not make registration today. He will try again later this afternoon or tomorrow morning. I am nervous for everyone. There is so much misinformation; the refugees of the Jungle and other camps like Isberg hear differing reports which they then share amongst themselves. The tensions grow because we also cannot guarantee them anything. We also are given limited information. Would you trust anyone who cannot give you any guarantees?

[Photo: Demonstrators protesting legislative threats to privatize public housing instituted under Chavez. Credit: Venezuela Analysis .] =By= Mike Weisbrot Editor's Note Mike Weisbrot deserves a round of applause for not trying to make this a simple issue. I, and I imagine you, have read plenty of those. So set you brain to hold more than four strands and off you go! T he international media have provided a constant fusillade of stories and editorials (not always easily distinguished from each other) about the collapse of the Venezuelan economy for some time now. Shortages of food and medicine, hours-long lines for basic goods, incomes eroded by triple-digit inflation and even food riots have dominated press reports.
The conventional wisdom has a set of predictable narratives to explain the current economic mess. 'Socialism' has failed 'î never mind that the vast majority of jobs created during the Hugo Ch√°vez years were in the private sector, and that the size of the state has been much smaller than in France. The whole experiment, it is said, was a failure from the beginning. 
According to this narrative, nationalizations, anti-business policies, populist overspending during the years of high oil prices and the collapse of oil prices since 2014 sealed Venezuela's fate. Adherents to this explanation say the downward spiral will continue until the chavistas are removed from power, either through elections or through a coup (most pundits don't seem to care which). 
The reality is somewhat more complicated. First, the Bolivarian experiment did pretty well until 2014. From 2004 'î after the Ch√°vez government got control over the national oil industry 'î until 2014, real income per person grew by more than 2 percent annually. This is an enormous change from the horrendous long-term decline in the 20 years prior to Ch√°vez, when GDP per capita actually shrank at an average annual rate of 1.2 percent. During the same years (2004'ì2014), poverty fell by 49 percent and extreme poverty by 63 percent 'î and this counts only cash income. The number of people over 60 years old receiving public pensions tripled, and millions of Venezuelans gained access to health care and education. It is the gains over this decade of chavismo that explain how the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) was able to win 41 percent of the vote in National Assembly elections in December 2015, despite serious shortages of consumer goods, 180 percent inflation and a deep recession. 
Now for the downward spiral of the economy over the past three years: Was this inevitable? And is it irreversible until the PSUV leaves power? To answer these questions, we must look at how Venezuela got into this situation, and how it might get out of it. The Story of Venezuela's Economic Recession 
In the fall of 2012, and again in February 2013, the government sharply reduced the availability of foreign exchange. It was during this time that shortages of basic goods accelerated, along with inflation and the black market price of the dollar. The official exchange rate, at which the government sold the vast majority of dollars earned from oil sales, was at 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes (Bs.F) per dollar. But a parallel market already existed, and the shortage of dollars at the official rate drove the parallel market sharply upward. At the same time, the higher parallel market price of the dollar increased inflation, because it increases the price of imported goods. 
And when inflation goes up, more people want to buy dollars, because they see the dollar as something secure that won't lose value to inflation. But this drives the price of the dollar up on the parallel market, which increases inflation even more. This cycle continues, causing an 'inflation-depreciation' spiral. In October 2012, inflation was at 18 percent, and the parallel market rate was at 13 percent. By the end of 2015, annual inflation was at 180 percent and the parallel market rate was at 833 percent. The shortages of consumer and other goods also contribute to this spiral, and they have increased with it. 
By the first quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan economy was already in recession, even though international oil prices were more than $100 a barrel. By January 2015, prices had fallen to $48 a barrel, and are about the same today. This depleted the government's revenue by a similar percentage, and the government resorted to printing money to cover expenses. The money creation would not necessarily accelerate inflation, but in the context of the inflation-depreciation spiral it certainly did. So inflation rose even faster. 
Since late March, the parallel market rate has fallen from a peak of more than 1,211 to about 1,025 Bs. per dollar today 'î about a 15 percent drop in the price of the dollar as measured in domestic currency 'î after shooting up rapidly for more than three years. At the same time, the government allowed the price of the dollar on a third market, called the SIMADI or DICOM rate, to go up. It is now at about 640 Bs. per dollar, or more than 60 percent of the parallel market rate. 
However, this does not mean that the economy is on the road to stabilization. 
First, the parallel rate is still 100 times the lower official rate of 10. Second, one of the main things that has slowed the inflation-depreciation spiral has been the deepening recession. There are far fewer people with money to buy dollars, and many are depleting their dollar savings in order to buy necessities. This has pushed down the price of the dollar on the parallel market. 
What this means is that the Venezuelan economy cannot recover under the current exchange rate system. It is stuck in recession. Furthermore, the multiple exchange rate system, with its vast differences between the different rates, creates an enormous incentive for corruption. Anyone with access to official dollars can multiply their income by 100 simply by selling them on the black market, which is completely accessible to almost anyone. 
But the official exchange rate system is only one way that the government's dollar revenue is lost. Gasoline, even after the recent price increases, is about 6 Bs. per liter 'î or about one US cent per liter at the SIMADI exchange rate. Electricity and gas are also heavily subsidized. These subsidies cost the government more than 13 percent of GDP. For comparison, the total income tax revenue (individual plus corporate) of the US federal government in 2015 was about 10.6 percent of GDP. At the same time, there are price controls that are difficult or impossible to maintain in the current economic situation. In 2015, overall consumer prices increased by 180 percent; yet food prices, which are subject to price controls, increased by 300 percent. This is a pretty clear demonstration that price controls are not working. A Possible Path to Recovery 
Millions of Venezuelans now make their living from arbitrage of some sort 'î from waiting in line for hours for a small allocation of subsidized food and reselling it, to trading currency on the parallel market, to selling stolen goods. Even a dictatorship with considerable repressive power to crack down on all illegal transactions would have trouble maintaining a functioning economy with the magnitude of these price distortions. But Venezuela is not a dictatorship; in fact, the state is very weak in terms of law enforcement. 
Given this situation, it is clear that serious reforms are necessary in order to restart the economy. The Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) has assembled a team of economists, headed by former president of the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fern√°ndez, which has presented a set of proposals. (Full disclosure: I am one of the members of this team.) 
The most obvious change that is needed is to unify the multiple exchange rate system. This should be done quickly, and in one step. The government can auction a fixed amount of dollars each day, with the price determined by supply and demand. Although allowing the currency to float seems scary to many people, the price of the dollar would undoubtedly stabilize at something considerably less than the current parallel market rate of about 1,000. A floating rate is also the only way to avoid wasting scarce foreign exchange reserves in a futile attempt to maintain an overvalued fixed rate. 
Since devaluations generally lead to price increases, it would be necessary to protect people from any rising costs of essential goods, including food. This could be done with a vast expansion of the government's current system of the Tarjeta Misiones Socialistas (a card system providing direct subsidies to lower-income families), which would give people a large discount that could compensate for any price increases. This system would be in place before the unification of the exchange rate. 
The energy subsidies could then be phased out more gradually over the next 18 months. To make this economically and politically acceptable, the additional government revenue as energy prices are allowed to rise would be added to the tarjetas (cards). This would be a net gain for the vast majority of Venezuelans. Some price controls 'î including those that do not allow producers to meet their costs 'î would be phased out. 
Other measures to protect people's living standards would include indexing wages to inflation, and creating a temporary public works program to create employment. These could be financed by a wealth tax similar to one in Colombia, and by a tax on financial transactions. 
The government can help finance the transition by selling some of its foreign assets. At the same time, it will have to restructure its debt in order to reduce the $17 billion of debt payments (interest and principal) that would otherwise be due over the next year and a half. 
All of this is feasible even with current oil prices because Venezuela has already adjusted its level of imports to match the fall in oil prices, which provide more than 90 percent of the country's dollar earnings. It has been an enormous adjustment; imports have fallen by more than half since 2012. For comparison, Greece, after more than six years of depression, has reduced its imports by 28 percent. 
This means that the hard part of the adjustment 'î the one that often requires people to reduce their living standards in order to sharply reduce imports 'î has already been done. It is relative prices now that have to be adjusted in order to recover. The result is that Venezuela can return to growth rather quickly, without the prolonged recession that neoliberal adjustment normally creates. Left Critiques of Proposed Economic Reforms 
Much of the left 'î including people inside the government and among the base of its party, the PSUV 'î rejects these economic reforms. They think it is a ' paquetazo ' (package) similar to International Monetary Fund (IMF) or neoliberal reforms that increased poverty in the past. They see the fixed exchange rate as socialistic and a floating exchange rate as a 'free market' reform. But in reality, the informal economy for dollars constitutes one of the most destructive 'free markets' that exists; it is the ' capitalismo salvaje ' ('savage capitalism') that Hugo Ch√°vez used to denounce. (Ch√°vez himself successfully floated Venezuela's currency in February 2002, and dollar reserves actually increased despite serious political instability.) And we can recall that the IMF supported fixed, overvalued exchange rates with disastrous results in Argentina, Brazil, Russia and a number of Asian countries in the last years of the 20th century. 
There is nothing neoliberal about a program in which the government creates employment, protects wages from inflation (which has not happened since inflation began to skyrocket nearly four years ago), subsidizes food and essential items on a large scale, and protects people generally from the burden of the adjustment of relative prices. 
Yet there are those on the left who seem to think that Venezuela can recover without fixing its most fundamental and destructive imbalances. Alfredo Serrano, an adviser to the government, posted eight ' economic theses ' on Venezuela on September 1. In 2,700 words, there is no mention of Venezuela's dysfunctional exchange rate system. 
At the same time, the US government 'î which has sought 'regime change' in Venezuela for the past 15 years 'î is trying to further destabilize the economy. In March 2016 President Obama once again declared that Venezuela posed an 'unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security' of the United States, and imposed economic sanctions. The sanctions themselves are not economically important, but they send a message to investors who know what happens to countries that are labeled an 'extraordinary threat' to the United States. The Obama administration has also pressured US financial institutions not to do business with Venezuela. 
The international media and their usual sources are also playing their traditional role, and some of the widely reported stories have been wrong. By 2015, there were widespread reports that the poverty rate had increased to 76 percent when this was practically impossible. The IMF, which has a long history of politically influenced forecasts, projected that GDP would shrink by 10 percent last year, when the actual figure was 5.7 percent. The media report IMF projections of 720 percent inflation for this year, although this is likely to be way off. It is further evidence of the media's extreme hostility to the Venezuelan government that so many journalists feel the need to exaggerate, even when Venezuela is facing its worst economic crisis in decades. But even during most of the economic boom between 2003 and 2008, when employment was rising rapidly and poverty was plummeting, it was hard to find anything positive about Venezuela in the major media. 
Nonetheless, it should be clear that the Venezuelan economy will not recover, even if oil prices were to rise rapidly, without some major reforms that can resolve its worst economic imbalances.
ARTICLE

shorty 
The following article by originally published in the December/January 2016 edition of Socialism Today, the magazine of the Socialist Party in England and Wales. H uman beings have radically altered the Earth, adapting nature in the struggle to survive and thrive. The pace of change accelerated rapidly with the development of agriculture and class-based society. It hit breakneck speed in the industrial revolution, and with post-war scientific and technological breakthroughs. Many now say that we have entered a distinctive geological epoch 'ì a new human era, the Anthropocene. JESS SPEAR, a member of Socialist Alternative in Seattle, USA, reports. Humans, arriving on the scene roughly a million years ago, and building modern industrial society as we know it only about 50 years ago, represent a blip in Earth's 4.5 billion year history. Yet, at each stage of humanity's development, we have modified nature and therefore modified our own evolution, setting the course for biological and social changes. From simple farming to unearthing and burning fossil fuels, to unleashing atomic bombs, our interaction with nature has gone from local to global. Humankind has, without a doubt, left our mark on the planet. We can discover what the Earth looked like, the shape and position of the continents as they have drifted apart and recombined every 300-500 million years, what creatures roamed its seas and land, and what plants covered the surface, by deciphering the chemical or physical imprints of their existence left behind. And what we've learned is that the planet is never static. The planet 'ì as we know it, the Earth system comprised of rock, water and atmosphere in constant interconnected cycles of energy exchange 'ì has always had upheaval, mass extinctions, and climate change. Earth's history is full of radical change. Nonetheless, scientists today are ringing the alarm bells over the rate of change we're witnessing compared to that which existed prior to human society. Climate scientists are pointing to the rapid shift in greenhouse gases, biologists to the rising number of species extinctions, oceanographers to the increasing acidity of the ocean, and soil scientists to the depletion of nutrients and degradation of farmland, as evidence that humanity's productive activity is overwhelming the Earth system. The rate of increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) is unlike anything they've seen in Earth's history for at least the past 800,000 years. Climate change and economic depression, the dual crises of capitalism, have produced a growing global revolt and a search for ideas and strategy to end our misery and protect future generations. Mass movements against austerity demonstrate that working people refuse to accept a system that demands severe cuts to living standards to satisfy the 1%. Not yet clear to the vast majority of people rebelling against the ruling elite is with what to replace this rotten system or how. With the window of opportunity to mitigate the consequences of climate change and prevent further disruption inching closer with each passing year, winning the working class to a socialist alternative is ever more paramount. Only scientific socialism can arm the working class with a programme and strategy to unite and fight to end the rule of the 1%, transfer power to the 99%, and rapidly implement a plan to develop society along sustainable lines. More heat, more problems W e live relatively brief lives. With only a little less than a century for our point of reference, our perspective on global changes is correspondingly narrow. To add further obfuscation, the Earth is rather large, so we don't notice the accumulated effects of deforestation, glacier retreat, and massive piles of trash collecting in the Pacific and Atlantic ocean gyres. The Earth's temperature rising nearly a degree Celsius has virtually no meaning to communities who daily experience larger fluctuations. That we have unearthed and burned so much carbon, chemically changing the very air we breathe, that there are now 400 molecules of CO2 for every million air molecules 'ì a level not seen in, perhaps, the last 25 million years 'ì up from about 280, is generally unnoticeable. Yet, regardless of our inability to perceive the radical transformation of our atmosphere and the general out-of-sight-out-of-mind privilege most in the developed countries have when it comes to environmental destruction and pollution, we are nonetheless reaching dangerous tipping points. The consequences of burning fossil fuels have long been known. As early as 1896, Svante Arrhenius published a paper detailing how CO2 absorbs light reflected from Earth's surface, preventing it from escaping the Earth system (that is, the greenhouse effect). In the late 1950s, Charles Keeling began measuring the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Within just a few years he made the startling discovery that not only are there are seasonal fluctuations in CO2 related to plants absorbing it, then decomposition returning it to the atmosphere, but that the overall concentration was rapidly rising every year. The Keeling Curve 'ì which continues to grow as measurements are added to a continuous record from 1958 to today 'ì is regarded as the first proof that industrial activity was transforming the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. Yet, it is the dramatic and speedy depletion in Earth's ice inventory that is the canary in the coalmine. The news last year that the west Antarctic ice sheet has destabilised and is expected to disintegrate over the coming centuries should have elicited an immediate response from world leaders. The ice sheet holds enough water to raise global sea level by about 3.3 meters! There is no way to prevent its demise. We can only now adapt to the rising seas. Added to this is the news that a section of the Greenland ice sheet, which contains the equivalent of half a meter global sea level rise, is also melting rapidly. Arctic sea ice has dramatically been reduced, as well, and scientists expect the Arctic will be ice free in the summer as early as 2020. Earth's glaciers and ice sheets act as a global air conditioner, keeping the planet cooler than it would be otherwise by reflecting sunlight. The loss of Earth's ice (land-based ice that is) will not only raise sea level, displacing the more than one billion people inhabiting low-lying coastlines. It will also further disrupt climate, acting as a positive feedback reinforcing global warming. As the ice melts, the Earth absorbs more heat, more ice melts, and so on. Still, for most people, climate change is about hotter summers and extreme weather events. And, we are not just talking about our future 'ì which will undoubtedly get hotter, with more intense weather 'ì but our current state of affairs. 2015 is set to be the hottest year on record. We have now hit the one degree mark (above pre-industrial levels) for average global temperature rise (up from 0.85 degrees). This added heat has produced heatwaves, flash flooding, and deadly weather events that force us to acknowledge that climate disruption is not merely something scientists debate and discuss for future generations. Climate change is our present. In 2003, an estimated 70,000 people died from the heatwave that gripped Europe. Since the 1960s extreme weather events have more than tripled, killing an estimated 60,000 people from mostly underdeveloped countries. The World Health Organisation estimates that without mitigation efforts we can expect an additional quarter of a million people will be killed by climate change related effects from 2030-50. For what we can expect our future climate to look and feel like, what's important to keep in mind is that the sheer scale of the problem that is current global climate change stems from just a tiny increase in global temperature. Just one degree Celsius. Imagine the impacts on us, the environment that sustains us, and the Earth system itself, when the Earth gets another degree warmer. That is what scientists tell us we can expect by the end of the century, if we don't stop 'business-as-usual'. Welcome to the Anthropocene T he alteration of our planet from human activity, from the top of the atmosphere down to the bottom of the ocean, is so extensive that a growing number of scientists who study Earth's history and system are now hotly debating whether we have entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene (anthropo 'ì human, cene 'ì new), or maybe we have been in it for centuries and just didn't know it. Proposing a new geological epoch is not merely adding a date and name to the geological time scale, which spans 4.5 billion years from the formation of the solar system to the present day. In fact, the geological time scale itself is not merely a list of dates and names. It's also a tool 'ì a common measurement scientists use to understand how changes on our planet from its birth until now occurred. The eons, eras and epochs that comprise it are distinguished by rapid shifts on the entire planet. Acceptance of the Anthropocene as a new epoch is therefore a question of whether the impact humanity has made is abrupt, discernible globally, and undeniably different from the previous epoch, the Holocene (and before that, the Pleistocene). In other words, has human activity fundamentally disrupted the Earth system such that it can be seen in the rocks, water, and atmosphere, and future scientists will see it? Proponents of adding the new epoch to the geological time scale disagree about when, exactly, the Anthropocene began. The three dates currently being debated 'ì 8,000 years ago, the industrial revolution, and 1945 'ì represent markers along the road to civilization as humanity discovered and applied new ways to modify nature to satisfy our basic needs. Some argue it began roughly 8,000 years ago when humans began clear-cutting forests and rice farming, which altered the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. Others argue the Anthropocene really started at the beginning of the industrial revolution when widespread use of fossil fuels began disrupting the Earth system, leading to the effects we are witnessing today and will experience in the future. The widespread atomic bomb testing, beginning with the Trinity Test in 1945, is the latest date proposed. It is supported not because atomic bomb testing itself disrupted the Earth system 'ì though we should not forget that scientists warned of the dangers of a nuclear-war-induced 'atomic winter' 'ì but because atom bombs leave a global fingerprint easily seen and measured, and atom bomb testing marks the rise of American capitalism's unprecedented period of expansion. Unlike previous changes to the geological time scale, however, the proposals have political and social implications. That scientists are suggesting a new epoch marked by human-caused alterations has correctly been seized by many environmentalists as concrete proof that we are indeed radically altering the planet. The response from the left has been a mixture of confusion and conflation of the scientific debate and the predictable political response. Some anti-capitalists call foul over the name of the epoch. They argue that its focus on humans, and therefore insinuating all humans are responsible, hides the real root of the rapid changes taking place: namely, capitalism. To others, particularly deep green ecologists, it is proof that humanity is largely sociopathic 'ì how dare we name an epoch after humans! 'ì and that really civilization is the problem, not humans. These arguments stem from either a misunderstanding or a lack of understanding of how humanity and human society developed over the last million years. A historical materialist analysis of human history and pre-history is in fact the key to unlocking the door to our sustainable future. Change is constant 'úHistory can be viewed from two sides: it can be divided into the history of nature and that of man. The two sides, however, are not to be seen as independent entities. As long as man has existed, nature and man have affected each other'ù, wrote Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in The German Ideology (1846). Many in the environmental movement, however, believe we can't interact in nature without causing harm because we, humans, are separate from nature. This argument is embodied in a book written by environmental leader and founder of 350.org, Bill McKibben, The End of Nature (1989). Similar to Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962), McKibben's book is seen as one of the first to warn humanity of the dangers of global warming. In it McKibben doesn't just warn about carbon pollution, he passionately argues that humanity has destroyed nature, that 'úwe have ended the thing that has, at least in modern times, defined nature for us 'ì its separation from human society'ù. We have altered the chemistry of the atmosphere, he argues, therefore there is no place on Earth one could travel that is untouched by humanity. Yet, our 'separation from nature' is a recent phenomenon, a product of capitalism, which combined wage labour with social production for private profit, separating humans from the Earth on which they laboured for sustenance. For the vast majority of human existence we were intimately connected to the Earth, learned and accumulated knowledge of its seasonal changes, and experienced it as part of our existence, even though we lacked understanding of its driving forces. As Marx explained, 'úman lives from nature, ie, nature is his body, and he must maintain a continuing dialogue with it if he is not to die'ù. So, the conception that we are separate from nature is also recent, and is linked to the development of capitalism. The notion that it is modern industrial society that's the problem, and that a return to living directly from the Earth is the solution, is both overly simplistic and ahistorical. It extracts civilization from the history of humanity and measures its impact based on the presumed better situation that existed previous to civilization 'ì for the Earth, but clearly not for humans as we died from all sorts of health issues now treatable and preventable. Furthermore, it ignores that pre-modern humans also greatly altered the Earth. For as long as we've had boats (10,000+ years) and people crossed the seas, at first in search of food, then for imperialist conquest and/or in search of religious freedom, we have unknowingly (and many times knowingly) transported species from one side of the Earth to the other, radically altering ecosystems, causing some species to flourish in new environments and others to go extinct. The proponents of the earliest start date for the Anthropocene would argue the advent of agriculture at the end of the last ice age even altered the chemistry of the atmosphere, evidence that humans were radically changing the planet as early as 8,000 years ago. Indeed, we are not even the first species to transform the atmosphere. To give an extreme example, around 2.7 billion years ago, cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) appeared, becoming the first organisms to photosynthesize and produce oxygen as a by-product. Before they evolved and started pumping out oxygen, there was practically no oxygen in the atmosphere. Without cyanobacteria we would not exist. Interaction with nature without altering it is impossible. Living organisms must exchange material with the Earth to live, thereby influencing their environment, affecting their evolution and others. As Richard Levins and Richard Lewontin write in The Dialectical Biologist (1985), 'úthe environment and the organism codetermine each other'ù. But if all species impact nature in some way, are we, with our increasing population and extensive industrial activity, relegated to the role of nature's perpetual destroyer? Within or without? O ur ability to understand the impact we are having on the planet, that it will have negative consequences for us both in the short and long term, and the decisions we make to alter the course of history, is what sets us apart from cyanobacteria and other organisms. Labour is not just a source of wealth. It is also what created humanity, conscious thought, conscious planning, and the accumulation of knowledge. The advent of tools, and with it the co-development of the mind, the social activity of hunting and the creation of language, put us on a path to producing food surpluses, the very basis of class society, civilization and scientific understanding. In short, all of human history can be distilled down to the organisation of labour and technique, and the concurrent changes in culture, society, and our environment. When capitalism replaced feudalism, it started the long process of drawing ever larger sections of the population away from farms and into factories and cities, and changed our ideas about nature in relation to ourselves. No longer did we see ourselves as part of nature, but separate. For the capitalists, nature became a source of free wealth which, when moulded by human labour, produced enormous profits for them. For the new working class, alienated from nature, the ripping apart of the Earth for raw materials, the dumping of toxins into rivers, and the sooty skies above urban centres, represented an assault on nature, a degradation of once beautiful areas. At each moment, as humanity leapt from the agricultural revolution to the industrial revolution, our ideas about ourselves in relation to nature shifted. Towards a socialist future 'úWe don't want merely an amelioration of the present society, but the establishment of a new one'ù. (Engels, quoted by John Green in A Revolutionary Life, 2008) Capitalism has now outlived its usefulness for humanity. It is destroying the environment, disrupting our climate, and relegating a billion people to the slow death of starvation and malnutrition. No one could argue that a system based on the profit motive will solve a problem on which it depends for existence. Capitalism cannot offer the means to restore ecological balance because it places no value in nature. Yet, to throw all of modern civilization, fostered by the tremendous wealth, technology, and resources developed by capitalism, into the dustbin, as some suggest we do, because it also produced environmental destruction, is to ignore the potential, also created by this system, to create a sustainable future. When capitalism triumphed over feudalism, it unshackled science from the confines of religion which sought to stifle discoveries that challenged its rule. Further development of capitalist technique, socialised production, division of labour, and machinery, required major leaps in science. And though investment in scientific research is primarily focused on how to further maximise profits, the ruling class today also cannot hold back discoveries that ultimately undermine its authority. Whether it is plastic made from banana peels or solar roadways, science applied to environmental and social problems is eroding the authority of those who say fossil fuels are necessary. Capitalism also developed the force which has the power to liberate all of humanity: the working class. As capitalism forced people off the land and into mainly urban wage labour, it created the force which has the common interest and potential to overthrow it and create a society that benefits the majority. All around you see working people rising up and demanding change because, not only does capitalism hold back the transition to renewable energy, it refuses to invest in society. The quest for profits has every major corporation and smaller businesses seeking to compete for a market share, depressing wages, cutting benefits, and threatening economic ruin for tax cuts. No longer is capitalism able to grow enough reserves to offer the working class a share of the profits. The ruling elite globally have no idea how to both restore economic growth and ensure payment to the major bondholders of sovereign debt. Anti-austerity movements from Ireland to Spain to the heroic working class in Greece have refused to accept their fate. Protests against new trade deals 'ì the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership 'ì reveal that working people understand that corporations are looking to cement their rule into international law, ignoring the needs of people and the planet. Overcoming a system that is based on the exploitation of us all, that separated us from nature, and is driving us towards a completely unsustainable future, starts first and foremost with a rejection of its ideas. If we limit what humanity is, ignore what it was and, importantly, do not understand how it changed from one to the other, then we are effectively rejecting the idea that we have evolved and, crucially, that we are still in the process of evolving. The state of the planet during the Anthropocene, whether we accept the earliest start date or the latest, is that of constant change. Our evolution from hunter/gatherers to modern industrial society involved constant interaction with our environment. It shaped us. We shaped it. Through this process we developed ideas about what we are, what our environment is, and our relation to each other. Humanity, with all the accumulated knowledge and experience of past generations, has over this time also developed the capacity to finally move beyond merely surviving to actually living. The vast resources, technology, wealth, and human ingenuity could be harnessed and directed to ending the needless suffering, raising living standards globally, and achieving ecological balance. If we grasp this fact and use it to inform our actions, then we can take control over the changes taking place today and which will occur in the future. This vision has the potential to unite the working class in its historical task of overthrowing capitalism. We are at a precipice from which we can choose to either leap off, hoping that capitalism will find a way to profit from building us a safety net, or we can appropriate the tools, technology and resources to build a bridge to a socialist future.

Anna Jaunger Correspondent, Inside Syria Media Center R ecently, the White House has repeatedly accused Syria and its allies of killing civilians in Aleppo, deliberate airstrikes at civilian infrastructure and so on. But it should be mentioned that usually these allegations are completely baseless. Ironically, in the midst of this immense uproar about the cruelty of the Syrian government and its Russian allies, Washington keeps carrying out notorious military ops resulting in casualties not among terrorists but mostly among civilians. 
On October 25, Amnesty International published a statement according to which in the space of two years at least 300 people were killed by the US-led coalition's airstrikes. 
Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director at Amnesty International's Beirut regional office, stated that analysis of available evidence suggests that in each of these cases, Coalition forces failed to take adequate precautions to minimize harm to civilians and damage to civilian targets. 
Despite the fact that AI bases its assessments on the data received from Syrian human rights organizations, local monitoring organizations and satellite images and footage, an AI expert, Neil Sammonds, claimed that it was just statistics, and that there might be many more casualties. 
Although John Kerry commented on the report, the US isn't accustomed to recognizing its 'mistakes'. For instance, the airstrike e.g. bloodbath, conducted by the US-led coalition against government troops in Deir Ezzor in mid-September. After numerous excuses and denials, Washington eventually claimed then that it was a mistake. This 'mistake' looked rather suspicious as ISIS militants started their offensive towards the Syrian army position immediately after the airstrikes. M oreover, Lieutenant General Stephen J. Townsend, the commander of Operation Inherent Resolve, has admitted that due to the Command's strategic mistakes by Iraq's troops and their US-backed allies they still haven't been able to surround and block Mosul. Unfortunately, these 'accidental' lapses allow the terrorists to freely leave the city and penetrate Syria. Of course, this development entails the creation of new flashpoints in the country, with further endangerment of the lives of civilians.
It bears repeating that in Mosul the US-led coalition is doing the same things that Washington now is trying to blame Damascus and its allies for. Only in the last three days, the coalition airstrikes have killed 60 civilians. Just since October 21, US warplanes conducted an airstrike against a school in the south of Mosul, and the next day attacked residential neighborhoods in the east of the city, and on October 23, air strikes destroyed a house of civilians in northern Mosul. 
Thus, it is clear that the United States, while claiming it is fiercely fighting terrorists in the Middle East, a claim heavily disseminated throughout its corporate media, it is in actuality doing the opposite, while preparing more devious mayhem and endless chaos in these tormented nations.

By the constant administration of lies, the media puppeteers manufacture wars, protect the super-wealthy, and destroy democracy. Joe Giambrone ' We like nonfiction, and we live in fictitious times. We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elect a fictitious President. We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons. Whether it's the fiction of duct tape or the fictitious orange alerts, we are against this war, Mr. Bush.''ìMichael Moore Oscar acceptance speech, moments before his mic was cut off. T his year may mark a turning point, where the moral bankruptcy was laid bare for all. I'm speaking of the Bernie Sanders flip-flop for Hillary Clinton, the predictable bait-and-switch, which Democrats never seem to imagine in real time. The rest of us have seen it so often that the ruse has become routine Standard Operating Procedure. A particularly notable case is Sarah Silverman (left) , the filthy-mouthed comedienne, who originally championed Bernie. But she quickly fell into lockstep for Hillary. Silverman had a soul empty enough to go and scold the United States to support a candidate whom she had just been fighting against , and who actually stole the nomination from her own candidate through back-room deals at the DNC and through apparent voting-machine hacking . The thief was rewarded instead of jailed for some reason, which Hollywood has had absolutely zero interest in, as if it didn't happen. They moved on instantly to lambast us all about Donald Trump 24/7. Orwell couldn't have written it better. Hollywood has a highly complex understanding of political philosophy and particularly of this presidential race: 1. Trump Bad 2. Hillary Woman 3. So-called 'Lesser Evil' W e should acknowledge, those who are literate, that Hillary Clinton's repeated threats to escalate World War 3 over Syria leave her as potentially the greater evil, not the lesser at all. The jury is very much out. 'Goldwater Girl' Hillary Rodham Clinton has a lengthy record of supporting every US aggressive war and opposing none. She may have played a part in the killings of over 2 million human beings so far, merely tallying those casualties from the three countries of Iraq, Syria and Libya. One may opt to also add another half-million Iraqi children who died as a result of her husband's eight years of sanctions. I noticed Hollywood's widespread mindless support for Democrats back in 2000, when I kicked that shockingly corrupt party to the curb and joyfully cast a vote for Ralph Nader, an actual American hero whose efforts have saved lives. Die-hard whiners of the Democratic rank-and-file still falsely claim that big bad Ralph gave the election to Dubya Bush, when anyone with the ability to read can see that it was the Supreme Court which stopped the legitimate counting of Florida ballots. Add Bush's brother Jeb purging nearly two-hundred thousand minority voters from rolls. But the mindless strategy of attacking third parties and attempting to delegitimize democracy itself persists among the ignorant (a majority of Democrats perhaps). This is by design; this is who they are. They do not believe in democracy, because the billionaires who fund them do not believe in any democracy they cannot control. But the mindless strategy of attacking third parties and attempting to delegitimize democracy itself persists among the ignorant (a majority of Democrats perhaps). This is by design; this is who they are. They do not believe in democracy, because the billionaires who fund them do not believe in any democracy they cannot control . George W. Bush's theft of the presidency did help expose the moral bankruptcy of Democrats as well as Republicans. When Bush lied about Iraq, Hillary Clinton was right there with him embellishing and freestyling! She claimed Iraq's non-existent 'weapons of mass destruction' to be 'undisputed.' Her lies helped sell the war to Congress, a war of aggression: what the Nazis did and were hung for at Nuremberg. Her role in aggressive war and in destroying International Law as a restraint against belligerence are profound crimes, grievous war crimes: 'the supreme international crime' in the words of U.S. Judge Robert Jackson. When a handful of Democrats attempted to impeach the Bush junta for crimes relating to those wars, as well as to torture and cover-up, it was Democrat Nancy Pelosi who announced 'Impeachment is off the table.' Criminal collusion, allowing the crimes to stand without recourse, that is what they did. The US federal government has served as a protection racket for international war crimes. The damage that Democrats inflicted upon the rule of law is equal to that of the Republicans. The former had a moral and legal responsibility to defend the Constitution, their oaths of office, but voluntarily opted not to. The Internet helped flood the world with information to pass around, both good and bad, but the crimes of both parties became difficult for them to wash away now that Google made all web searchers equal. Today, things have accelerated into realms of the absurd. CNN recently cut off a congressman in mid-sentence for uttering the word 'Wikileaks.' This Soviet-style clampdown on dissent remains a shocker even in a society that's pretty much seen it all. The media, distrusted by most , is only one aspect of the problem though. Americans get their views from joking heads as much as from stodgy teleprompter readers. Talk shows and comedy skits propagandize viewers every bit as much as do the Washington Post or New York Times . Celebrity endorsements matter. Documents recently emerged that confirm Oliver's willingness to shill for Hillary. And he's not alone among the so-called cutting-edge 'perceptive' comedians. Bill Maher has long been a Democratic party loyalist, and recently Amy Schumer'îfor all her smarts and anti-status quo posturing'îcame out strongly for Hillary. Schumer may be a dupe and clueless about the true nature of the Hillary option, but Oliver cannot be so easily forgiven. A casual glance at those programs would reveal that democracy is non-existent in Hollywood today. All voices are not represented. Minority candidates cannot get air time, will not be interviewed, and will only be mocked in absentia as per John Oliver's recent disgraceful hit piece on Green Party candidate Jill Stein , a cowardly move John. Shameful. But Oliver is far from alone. I single him out because he knows better and could have done justice to the Green Party and to its clear alternative to perpetual war, empire, and industrialized ecocide. But where would that have left him personally vis a vis the Hollywood political consensus? Nowhere is presidential candidate Jill Stein welcome, not on the debate stage where she belongs, not on the daily puff shows, not on the edgy comedy interview shows, and not on SNL. This blanket censorship is quite glaring, and clearly part and parcel of a system rigged in favor of Democrats'ïno matter who they are, nor how long their rap sheets happen to be. Hollywood's strategy is as simple-minded as those who are easily programmed by it. They point the finger endlessly at the boogie-man, who happens to be Donald Trump this year'ïit's the same every cycle. It was the evil Romney, the evil McCain and the evil Bush Jr. prior. In regimented fashion, the entire industry demonizes the enemy du jour , and so ensures that the crimes of their own candidate never receive any light of day. That's the trick. In their manufactured hysteria over the latest Republican they omit the entire criminal history of the Democratic nominee, how she stole the nomination in the first place for instance, and they avoid mentioning all the non-criminal alternatives, who are not corrupted by Wall Street, the military-industrial-complex, and foreign tyrants. This manufactured hysteria is strategic, and it is a false dichotomy. The fake two-candidate only choice is never questioned by Hollywood. To do so would mark one as an aberration, a non-conformist, a free thinker. You would be outcast to hobnob with the likes of Charlie Sheen, Gary Busey, Roseanne Barr, and Randy Quaid. This conformism is a mechanism of social control, and it's not a laughing matter. I use the word kakistocracy more often lately, rule by the worst. Only the worst, the most corrupt, the biggest liars can rise in this rigged system. A more formal study pegged it as ' oligarchy ,' but I find the term bland. It is very much rigged on numerous levels to keep out the honest and the moral. If that's not a problem to you, Hollywood , then you are indeed living in a fantasy story: Michael Moore's fictional times roll on. ' dems ? Do U have any thoughts on Obama's transition from a progressive academic humanist 2 a regressive corporate warlord?' Joe Giambrone is an author and independent filmmaker . He publishes Political Film Blog mainly to store evidence of these ongoing crime sprees. Bonus Feature: Originally Posted on FEBRUARY 20, 2013 by JOE GIAMBRONE H ollywood likes to pretend that things aren't political when they are. It's that bi-partisan nationalist myth that if both corporate parties agree to cheer for the empire, then everyone cheers for the empire. It's gotten so bad now that races like the Oscars and the Writer's Guild screenwriting award are tight contests between one CIA propaganda film and another CIA propaganda film. The first one helps to demonize Iranians and set up the next World War scenario, while the second film fraudulently promotes the effectiveness of state-sanctioned torture crimes. If there ever was a time for loud disgust and rejection of the Hollywood / Military-Industrial-Complex, this would seem to be it ( contact@oscars.org ). Naomi Wolf made a comparison of Zero Dark Thirty ' s creators Bigelow and Boal to Nazi filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl ( Triumph of the Will ). That, to me, seems inappropriately offensive to Leni Riefenstahl. The good German filmmaker never promoted torture through deception. Nor was Triumph a call to war. The film was simply an expression of German patriotism and strength, rebirth from the ashes of World War I. The current insidious crop of propaganda, as in the CIA's leaking of fictional scenes about locating Osama Bin Laden through torture extraction, are arguably more damaging and less defensible than Riefenstahl's upfront and blatant homage to Hitler's leadership. The Zero Dark Thirty scandal should be common knowledge by now, but here is what the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence wrote to Sony Pictures about it: 'We believe the film is grossly inaccurate and misleading in its suggestion that torture resulted in information that led to the location of Usama bin Laden'¶ Instead, the CIA learned of the existence of the courier, his true name and location through means unrelated to the CIA detention and interrogation program.' The filmmakers had every opportunity to explore the issue more fully, instead of relying on the 'firsthand accounts' of the torturers themselves , and/or their allies within the Central Intelligence Agency. Notably, torturers are felons and war criminals. Those who know about their crimes and help cover them up are guilty of conspiracy to torture. Thus, these self-serving fairy tales that illegal torture led to the desired results (bin Laden) are tangled up with the motivation to protect war criminals from prosecution. Not only does this claim of successful torture help insulate the guilty from legal prosecution, it also helps to promote further criminal acts of torture in the future. Once this red flag issue was raised by the Senate, the filmmakers could have taken a second look at what they had put up on screens and reassessed the veracity of their material and the way it was being sold to the world. Instead they doubled down. Bigelow and Boal want it both ways, extraordinary access to CIA storytellers for a documentary-like 'factual' telling of the bin Laden execution, but they also want license to claim that it's just a movie and can therefore take all the liberties they please. Jessica Chastain, who plays a state-employed torturer/murderer, who also allegedly located Osama bin Laden, said : 'I'm afraid to get called in front of a Senate committee'¶ In my opinion, this is a very accurate film'¶ I think it's important to note the film is not a documentary.' In a nutshell, that's the Zero Dark Thirty defense. It's a highly sourced ' very accurate film ,' but we can take all the liberties we like because it's not a documentary, and so if we made up a case for torture based on the lies of professional liars in the CIA, then oops. Mark Boal went so far as to mock the Senate Intelligence Committee, at the NY Film Critic's Circle : 'In case anyone is asking, we stand by the film'¶ Apparently, the French government will be investigating Les Mis.' Any controversy over the picture seems to help its box office, as more uninformed people hear about it. The filmmakers themselves suffer no penalty as a result of misleading a large number of people on torture, to accept torture, to accept a secretive criminal state that tortures with impunity. Kathryn Bigelow's wrapped-in-the-flag defense of the film: 'Bin Laden'¶ was defeated by ordinary Americans who fought bravely even as they sometimes crossed moral lines, who labored greatly and intently, who gave all of themselves in both victory and defeat, in life and in death, for the defense of this nation.' (emphasis in original) Nice propaganda trick at the end equating those who 'gave all of themselves' and 'death' with the individuals who ' sometimes crossed moral lines.' Everyone's dirty; you see. All heroes are torturers; so it's okay. Bigelow's half-assed response to getting called out by the Senate for putting false torture results into her film, is to say : 'Torture was, however, as we all know, employed in the early years of the hunt. That doesn't mean it was the key to finding Bin Laden. It means it is a part of the story we couldn't ignore . War, obviously, isn't pretty, and we were not interested in portraying this military action as free of moral consequences.' (emphasis added) Ignore? By her reasoning, because the Central Intelligence Agency tortured people, she was required to fit it into the plot somehow, whether it was relevant to the investigation or not. That's her excuse. No matter that the scenes are fabrications, and the actual clues about bin Laden's courier came from elsewhere (electronic surveillance, human intelligence, foreign services). Bigelow told Charlie Rose , when asked the same question about the torture: ' Well I think it's important to tell a true story .' Unfortunately, when confronted with the Senate investigation, truth quickly takes a back seat. The truth Bigelow now clings to is that, 'Experts disagree sharply on the facts and particulars of the intelligence hunt, and doubtlessly that debate will continue.' To Kathryn Bigelow, the fact that the so-called 'experts' she has sided with are torturer criminals with a vested interest in her portrayal of their crimes never occurs to her. She can dismiss the entire matter as a 'debate.' Perhaps she no longer finds it ' important to tell a true story?' Kathryn Bigelow basking in the spotlight secured by shilling for the imperialist state. Kathryn Bigelow, America's Leni Riefenstahl, claims that Zero Dark Thirty tells 'a true story,' even when confronted by evidence that it is a lie. She is unapologetic and completely divorced from the real world damage her propaganda encourages. If this film takes home the Best Picture Oscar, it should serve as the cherry on top of a brutal, deceptive, decrepit and immoral empire, and signal this reality to the rest of the world. If this is allegedly the 'best' of America, then we are truly finished. As for Ben Affleck's Argo, its sins aren't so readily apparent. Both films show wonderful Central Intelligence 'heroes' acting to further US interests and take care of imperial problems. The Argo scenario is a rescue, however, instead of a hit. The problem is that Iran, a country thrown into a bloodthirsty dictatorship after its nascent democracy was murdered by the very same CIA in 1953, is now the bad guy. There are clearly two sides, and the film takes sides with the people who destroyed democracy in Iran and propped up an illegitimate monarch in order to control its oil and its refineries. When this despotic monarch whose secret police disappeared, tortured and murdered the political opposition 'ì with the help and training of the CIA 'ì is overthrown, we are supposed to overlook all that, because America is always good. We rescue our people. We risk our lives, and we come up with elaborate creative plans to help our people. We are heroic and triumphant vs. the inferior wild-eyed Persians and Arabs of the world. Now I do believe there's a real story there, and the situation is ripe for telling, but an extreme sensitivity to the political context would be required. As Jennifer Epps put it : ''¶[T]he Iran we see in the [ Argo ] news clips and the Iran we see dramatized are all on the same superficial level: incomprehensible, out-of-control hordes with nary an individual or rational thought expressed. '¶ But we never go behind-the-scenes at this revolution. (Instead, Affleck and screenwriter Chris Terrio's tempering historical introduction is soon outweighed by the visceral power of mobs storming walls, chador-clad women toting rifles, and banshees screaming into news cameras.) '¶The problem is that viewers who don't already know their Chomsky or William Blum aren't going to walk out of [ Argo ] muttering 'gee, it's more complicated than I thought.' Instead, they'll leave with their fears and prejudices reaffirmed: that Middle Easterners create terror, that Americans must be the world's policemen, and that Iranians cannot be trusted because they hate America. '¶ Argo almost completely ignores individual Iranians; its portrait of an entire culture is neither refined nor sophisticated; and it does reinforce a simplistic, Manichean perspective.' Enough said? So why are Argo and Zero Dark Thirty receiving all these awards? Are the awarding bodies so full of hyper-patriots who believe pro-American films can deceive and demonize with impunity, that they want to send an unequivocal message of support for these practices? Is hyper-nationalist propaganda in vogue now? With the ascendancy of Barack Obama, there is no longer a moral anti-war voice of any significant size in America. Obama, the smooth talker, has soothed away morality, ethics, law and rights. The empire is beyond reproach because Obama runs it. So the liberal center/left says nothing. Nothing but empty blather and ignorant praise of the Democrats. Murder is being codified in secret as we speak. Bush's wars are being publicly scaled down, only to ramp up new covert wars of conquest across Africa. Nothing substantial has changed since George W., only the style. There was a time when no one trusted the CIA. Far from heroes, they were the prime suspects in the assassination of president John F. Kennedy, and presidential candidate Robert Kennedy. CIA support of terrorists was well known, if not loudly opposed. This agency has sponsored Cuban exiles to commit acts of terrorism inside Cuba. Its Phoenix Program kidnapped and murdered Vietnamese villagers by the thousands, torturing and killing them for alleged communist sympathies. The CIA overthrew democracies from Iran to Gutemala to Chile, and was instrumental in waging a terror war against Nicaragua by employing drug-running mercenary terrorists called 'Contras.' When the Church Committee investigated the agency in the mid-70s, lots of dirty laundry was aired. The agency was reined in for a time. Assassination was made technically illegal. In the 1980s, the CIA fought a proxy war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan by funneling money and arms to radical Islamic Jihadists 'ì like Osama bin Laden 'ì and creating an intelligence/military monster in Pakistan, known as the ISI. With untold billions of dollars of US tax money, plus Saudi oil money, the Pakistanis were propped up as a central hub for militant groups to operate throughout the region. Pakistan is where Osama bin Laden allegedly ended up living for the last decade of his life, half a mile from the Pakistani military academy. The CIA today is instrumental in the blitzkrieg of terror across Syria. It funnels arms and money to radical Islamic Jihadists, exactly as it did in Afghanistan in the 1980s. In 2011 it participated in the Libyan Crime Against the Peace doing much the same type of activity on behalf of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, a group that helped take over that nation despite being included on the US State Department's Terrorist List! The LIFG has sent its fighters over to Syria, after the fall of Qadaffi, to assist in the genocidal guerrilla war against the Syrian state, as well as civilians. The CIA assists in these activities. But of course those victims aren't Americans. So none of that counts. ''¶Is it healthy for us to hold up images of Cold War CIA agents as selfless do-gooders?'

Photo by manhhai | CC BY 2.0 I n classical mythology, the Acheron is one of the rivers of the Underworld. It marks the boundary between the living and the dead. The ferryman Charon ferries the dead across the Acheron to a place where they lose memory. Nothing of what made them human remains'îhappiness, suffering, love, hatred, guilt, regret, redemption, betrayal, forgiveness. From Gilgamesh to Odysseus to Aeneas, the living heroes of the epic descend into the Underworld at a point of despair in the sense of their quest. Burdened by a fate that requires momentous courage and tragic self-sacrifice for the sake of their people's survival, they resent the absurdity of their lot. Down there on a visit, they return from the shadow land strengthened. They recognize that the business of living is not oblivion but action. John Marciano's recently published book, The American War in Vietnam: Crime or Commemoration ? functions as such a Charon in reverse. It ferries readers back to the realm of remembering. This slim volume could not have come at a more opportune moment. American political culture is punch-drunk with the pursuit of war. The altered state is reaching the point of delirium tremens. Thwarted in the neocolonial scheme of annexing Syria by Russia's legal intervention, the American elite are pushing for confrontation. Though it is hard to think the unthinkable, the nuclear holocaust may happen if not by intention then by spontaneous combustion from over-intoxication with the fumes of war. This reckless confrontation results from decades of accumulated unaccountable power. Its boldness reflects a cumulative experience of impunity for aggressive behavior by soft and hard neocolonial postures since the end of WW II. The war in Vietnam, as Marciano suggests, should have functioned as the lesson that checked the nation's historical thrust for conquest, but the turning point would have required a national effort to relinquish the myth of the Noble Cause, the delusion that America is vested with a divine mandate to assimilate the people of the world to the American image'ìfor the people's own good. Britain had its White Man's Burden; France its mission civilatrise ; America its Manifest Destiny. This timely volume traces the war to the apocalyptic finale of the most powerful military in the world defeated by the determination, courage, and self-sacrifice of a peasant people unwilling to be enslaved. But this is as much a book about the past as it is about the present. It reminds us, with Tolstoy, 'The reality of war is in the killing, ' a realization officialdom would like to block. In fact, they have prepared a falsifying celebration of that moral and military debacle. As Marciano writes in his introduction, 'In May 2012, President Barack Obama and the Pentagon announced a Commemoration of the Vietnam War to continue through 2025, the fiftieth anniversary of the conflict's end. Among the Commemoration's objectives, three stand out: 'to thank and honor' veterans and their families . . . 'to highlight the advances in technology, science, and medicine related to military research conducted during' the war; and to 'recognize the contributions and sacrifices made by the allies'.' President Obama claimed in the commemoration announcement speech that the war had been 'an honorable cause.' Marciano challenges this notion. America's historic ideology of the Noble Cause, he writes, rests on the belief that the United States is 'A unique force for good in the world, superior not only in its military and economic power, but in the quality of its government and institutions, the character and morality of its people, and its way of life.' T his is the mystical bigotry of a messianic faith typical of empires. Imperial militarism seeks in a Noble Cause the justification for subjugating large chunks of humanity. In the distant past, the Noble Cause may have received the sword directly from a god'îas it did in postcolonial America when it sought to exterminate the native inhabitants. By the anointment of the sword, the divinity also endowed, supposedly, the conquering 'race' with moral superiority. Thus, imperialism, in the perverse arrogance of its twisted psyche, contains the germ of genocide. As a result, the superstition of a superior 'race' has been endured by most of the 'races' on the planet as a most Ignoble Cause. In Vietnam alone, the Big Lie of the Noble Cause sent four million Vietnamese to their death. Marciano leaves us in no doubt that the White House and the Pentagon are commemorating a crime. They are falsifying history in order to shape the future, which will be and is the reenactment of the war against Vietnam on a global scale. They want to establish the altar for a 'sacred union,' the nation united behind the Noble Cause of war. On the altar will sit the fetish of the export of the 'miracle of democracy, ' in reality the imposition of regimes of terror such as the Vietnam War planners established in Saigon. We see today in Ukraine that the 'miracle of democracy,' brought to Kiev by the US in 2014 to the tune of five billion dollars, amounts to a handful of dry dust, collected from the WW II graveyard of European Nazism, inciting a lot of blind, anti-democratic and noxious nationalism. As through a glass darkly, Marciano shows us that in the war crime against Vietnam we can see reflected the crimes perpetrated today from Afghanistan to Yemen, from Iraq to Syria, from Yugoslavia to Libya and across the African continent. As in Vietnam (the fakery of the Gulf of Tonkin incident), today's war are based on fabricated pretexts; as in Vietnam (napalm and agent orange), today's wars are chemical wars (depleted uranium for Yugoslavia and Iraq; phosphorus for Falluja); as in Vietnam (Hanoi and Haiphong) the bombings destroy urban life, vital infrastructure, schools and hospitals; as in Vietnam (Laos, Cambodia) the bombings spreads out (today to Yemen); as in Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh) the leaders who resist US penetration are demonized (Milosevic, Saddam, Qaddafi, Assad) as enemies of humanity. As in Vietnam, all the wars of today are fought mostly to prevent or reverse independence and self-determination of former colonial places. Finally, as in Vietnam the USSR, today's Russia is emerging as the displacement of all the guilt that weighs on the shoulders of the Noble Cause. The Washington Post recently wrote 'the Kremlin annexed Ukraine.' I read it twice'înot 'annexed Crimea,' the standard disinformation, but the whole of Ukraine! Does one laugh or weep? Does one have to take a hallucinogenic to see Russian flags and images of Putin blanketing Kiev instead of Neo-Nazi emblems and images of Bandera? The next president will certainly be Hillary Clinton, whom I call 'the centripetal president.' From Republicans to Democrats to Neo-Cons, all converge on endorsing the war candidate. In her consensus war regime, the elite will decide everything. We will not be consulted. This is why The American War in Vietnam: Crime or Commemoration? is a vital read. It calls for our re-democratization'ìto question our leaders, to be skeptical of the media, to avert our eyes from the petrifying stare of the Medusa decked with the aegis of the Noble Cause; to challenge'îeven ridicule'ì the vaunted humanitarianism of an elite of bloodhounds baying for war; to refuse to commemorate war crimes and to work to stop them. Above all, we need to remember that the crimes of other governments are the responsibility of the people of those governments'înot of our bombs. Though our elite have abrogated to themselves the power and the right to remake the map of the world by force, we need to reassert the legal principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of a sovereign states if we are serious about peace. We, citizens, do not have the right (or the power, unless we line up behind the power of the militarist state) to change the practices of other states, but we do have the right to demand change for those of our own. Let's start exercising that right. We did for Vietnam; we can do it again.

PAUL VAN AUKEN, WSWS.ORG 28 October 2016 T he United Nations Security Council was the scene Wednesday of a bitter exchange over the ongoing war in Syria, with the Western powers indicting Russia for war crimes over its operations in the northern city of Aleppo. The UN aid chief and former Tory member of the British parliament Stephen O'Brien set the tone by declaring himself 'incandescent with rage' over the inability of the Security Council to take action. 'Aleppo has essentially become a kill zone,' he said. The fact that both Russian and Syrian warplanes have halted their strikes against the Al Qaeda-affiliated Islamist militias that control eastern Aleppo for the past 10 days was brushed aside by Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the United Nations, who represents the living embodiment of imperialist 'human rights' hypocrisy. Clueless Americans' tax dollars at work: Samantha Power doing her Neocon best to stir up further trouble for humanity. Taunting Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin, she declared. 'You don't get congratulations and credit for not committing war crimes for a day or a week.' Continuing her tirade, Power asked, 'Does Russia believe that all of the children in eastern Aleppo are Al Qaeda members?' Such outrage over the fate of civilians and children is highly selective. None of the representatives of US imperialism and its allies evinced even a spark of rage over the killing of men, women and children in government-controlled western Aleppo, which is regularly bombarded by mortars and rockets provided to the Al Qaeda 'rebels' by the Pentagon and the CIA. On Thursday, rocket fire claimed the lives of six children in the west of the city, where the vast majority of the population lives. Three Syrian children died at their school, where 14 other students were wounded. In a separate attack, three young brothers died when a rocket struck their home. Nor for that matter, as far as the human rights imperialists are concerned, can the slaughter of civilians in US air strikes elsewhere in Syria be compared in any way to the deaths caused by Russian bombs in Aleppo. Amnesty International issued a report Tuesday on 11 separate strikes by the US-led 'coalition' in which it said some 300 civilians were killed. The Pentagon has acknowledged only one death in these bombing raids. Other monitoring groups have put the civilian death toll inflicted by the US air war in Syria at well over 1,000. All told, the Pentagon admits to killing only 55 civilians in two years. Power's jibe that the Russians view every child in Aleppo as a member of Al Qaeda applies with equal force to the Pentagon, whose bombs apparently kill only members of ISIS. Power is herself a veteran practitioner of this kind of grotesque double standard. This crusader for human rights took the effective position that 'every child in Gaza was a member of Hamas' during the 51-day Israeli siege of 2013 that killed over 2,100 Palestinians and wounded another 11,000. During this one-sided slaughter, the US ambassador used her post at the UN to relentlessly proclaim Israel's right to 'defend' itself. Waving the filthy imperialist human rights banner, she was also one of the leading proponents of the US-NATO war in Libya that killed tens of thousands and left the country in ruins, as well as the war for regime change in Syria, which has killed over 300,000 and driven millions from their homes. T he hypocrisy and double standard of the war crimes denunciations against Russia over Aleppo emerges most starkly in relation to the launching earlier this month of a US-led siege of the Iraqi city of Mosul, just over 300 miles to the east, which was overrun by ISIS in 2014. While the Russians are indicted for turning Aleppo into a 'kill zone,' the Western media routinely refers to the American onslaught as the 'liberation' of Mosul. To that end, US warplanes, rocket launchers and heavy artillery are relentlessly pounding the city of over a million, which analysts acknowledge will be reduced to rubble. The head of the US military's Central Command, Gen. Joseph Votel, boasted in an interview with AFP that his forces had killed '800 to 900 Islamic State fighters.' He said not a word as to how many civilians had died under the US bombardment; nor has the US corporate media shown any interest in that subject. When one horrific incident did come to light'îthe bombing of a Shia mosque near Kirkuk last Friday in which 17 women and children lost their lives and scores were wounded'îthe Pentagon brushed it aside and the media largely ignored it. Even as US officials, parroted by the press, indict ISIS for using Mosul's population as 'human shields''îa timeworn alibi for the slaughter of civilians'îthey ignore and tacitly support Al Qaeda's use of terror and violence to prevent civilians from fleeing from the besieged neighborhoods of eastern Aleppo. While the actions carried out by the Russian military against the civilians trapped in eastern Aleppo are no doubt reprehensible, they are not the real concern of those screaming about war crimes. Their fear is that the Al Qaeda-linked militias that serve as the principal proxy force in the war for regime change are facing a final rout. Power trying to dragoon the UN Russian delegate, V. Churkin. Encouraged and rewarded by their hypocritical masters, the empire's goons know no limits to their audacious indecency. More fundamentally, the crimes of Russia['îsuch as they are, and that, in itself needs careful contextual examination'î Editors] in Aleppo pale in comparison to those carried out by Washington in the region, and for that matter, around the globe. Have those who feign shock and rage over the Russian bombs dropped on Syria forgotten 'shock and awe?' The US invasion and occupation of Iraq took an estimated 1 million Iraqi lives. Are these champions of human rights unaware of the ongoing slaughter in Yemen, where over 10,000 people have died under Saudi airstrikes carried out with US supplied bombs and missiles and made possible by extensive intelligence and logistical aid from the Pentagon? Why is there no rage over a war by the ruling monarchy of the Middle East's wealthiest nation against the region's poorest, in which the systematic destruction of civilian infrastructure and a blockade imposed with the aid of US forces is threatening the population with starvation? When it comes to war crimes, the Kremlin oligarchy represented by Vladimir Putin is in the minor leagues. Since the end of World War II, and the US atomic bombs that killed some 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, virtually every US president has engaged in wars of military aggression that entailed war crimes, many of them on a scale surpassed only by the atrocities carried out by Hitler's Third Reich. The Korean War resulted in 3 million civilian deaths; in Vietnam, the US killed some 3 to 4 million civilians. Afghanistan's tragic and protracted encounter with US imperialism, dating back to the CIA-orchestrated war of regime change of the 1980s, claimed the lives of between 1.5 and 2 million more. Meanwhile, Washington remains at war in at least seven different countries, where civilian deaths continue to mount daily: Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen and Somalia. The source of the feigned rage and tears over Aleppo is the fact that the US war for regime change in Syria has turned into a debacle. Moscow launched its intervention in defense of the interests of Russia's ruling capitalist oligarchy, not those of the Syrian masses. Nonetheless, it has presented an obstacle to the US drive to assert its hegemony over the entire oil-rich region of the Middle East. The unrelenting 'human rights' propaganda and demonization of Russia over Aleppo stands as a warning. US imperialism is preparing a major escalation, not only of the US intervention in Syria, but of its confrontation with Russia itself, carrying with it the real and present danger of a nuclear war.

shorty BY PETER LEE I 've written a couple pieces of the smoking hot issue in Pivotland, Philippine president Duterte's swerve toward a pro-PRC foreign policy, and what the U.S. and pro-American sector of the Manila elite are going to do about it. The first piece, Reports of death of US-Philippine alliance may be exaggerated, addresses the fact that Duterte's freedom of movement is constrained by the need to keep the Philippine military happy, and notes that ex-prez and retired general Fidel Ramos, who facilitated Duterte's entrance on the national political stage, is signaling dissatisfaction with Duterte. The second piece, Duterte Plays the 'Mamasapano' Card, covers a Duterte counter-attack: a threat to relitigate the death of 44 Philippine National Police commandos at Mamasapano in Mindanao, a 2014 special ops fiasco conducted under the aegis of the United States which a) exposes ex-president Aquino to serious legal jeopardy b) posits that the US alliance is doing a better job of killing Filipinos than the PRC can ever hope to do. The US seems to be embedded in a colonial mindset when it comes to the Philippines, something along the lines of 'we've been selflessly looking after the Philippines for a century, and that thug Duterte won't be allowed to screw that up during his brief (maybe curtailed) presidency.' It takes a pretty superficial view of Philippine history, one that accepts the US self-definition as the Philippines' security savior while ignoring the distortions and shortcomings of the colonial and neo-colonial relationship. For me this tunnel vision was typified by the US media crowing over the formal delivery of a refurbished C-130 transport to the Philippine government by outgoing ambo Philip Goldberg. Message: here's the US making provisions for Philippine defense at the same time Duterte's selling out the country to China. To me, the inadvertent message was 1) here's the US blindly stroking the pivot fetish while Duterte tries to solve the Mindanao insurgency that has cost at least 400,000 lives over the last century, win his drug war, and find a place for the Philippines in Asia that doesn't give primacy to the US preoccupation confronting the PRC and 2) the U.S., in my opinion, pretty much has a policy of keeping the Philippines flat on its behind as an independent military force by trickling out second-hand gear to the Philippine military while the sweet stuff is dangled in front of it during US joint military maneuvers and port calls. But the United States is trying to find political leverage wherever it can and the Western media will, I'm sure, put its shoulder to the wheel to help out. Feelings of nationalism are pervasive in the US, but Americans have difficulty understanding why people in other nations may harbor animosity toward them on account of their colonialist and imperialist experiences. P hilip Goldberg sat down for a 45-minute exit interview with Rappler. As befitting Rappler's origins in the Soros/Omidyar network of pro-US globalization advocacy, the interview was a stream of softballs about what to do about Duterte's disregard of the awesomeness of the American relationship, an awesomeness that is acknowledged by virtually all Filipinos who inexplicably (and, if the US has anything to do about it, temporarily) at the same time give Duterte approval ratings of over 80%. It's worth watching if you have the patience. Goldberg is a smooth cat, and the Rappler tonguebath gives you no inkling of the fact that he intimately familiar with the wet work of end-arounding national governments to cultivate secessionist movements, you know, like what he did in Bolivia (declared persona non grata as a result) and Kosovo, and like that thing in Duterte's home province of Mindanao, which in my opinion probably the main reason why Duterte wanted him out of the Philippines. Goldberg also discretely plays the economic threat card, concern-trolling that anti-US attitudes will dismay 'foreign investors'. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in subsequent weeks. As far as I can tell, the biggest U.S. factor in the domestic Philippine economy is the call-center industry. I doubt US corporations are interested in actually pulling their operations out and subjecting them to the English-language mercies of India, but certainly a call from the State Department or White House would convince them of the wisdom of at least making the threat. And I also wonder if expected President Hillary Clinton will find it necessary to drop the hammer on Duterte, in order to demonstrate to a rather dubious Asia that there is no alternative to loyalty to the pivot. I expect the next few months, in other words, to be very interesting. NOTE: ALL IMAGE CAPTIONS, PULL QUOTES AND COMMENTARY BY THE EDITORS, NOT THE AUTHORS

VINEYARD OF THE SAKER T he AngloZionst Empire's propaganda machine, otherwise known as the corporate media, has had great difficulties deciding what it should say about the Russian naval task force which has been sent to Syria. The Americans have decided to express their usual contempt for anything Russian and describe this force as centered on the 'geriatric' aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, while the Brits chose to describe it as a formidable 'armada' about to completely obliterate the moderate terrorists in Syria. Illustration above: The Nuclear Battle-Cruiser Peter The Great My friend Alexander Mercouris has recently written a superb analysis explaining that, in reality, this task force was neither geriatric nor that formidable. Rather than repeating it all here, I prefer to write what I will consider a follow-up to this excellent piece with a few more details added to it. The first step will be to debunk a few fundamental misconceptions. Let's begin by the Russian aircraft carrier. The 'Heavy Aircraft-Carrying Cruiser Admiral of the Soviet Fleet Kuznetsov' Did you know that the Russian don't even call the Admiral Kuznetsov an aircraft carrier. The official designation of the Kuznetsov is 'Heavy Aircraft-Carrying Cruiser'. It is important to understand why. What is, in your opinion, an aircraft carrier? Or, let me put it this way, why does the United States maintain a force of 10-12 heavy aircraft carriers? If you believe Ronald Reagan, it is to 'forward deploy' and bring the war to the Soviets (that was, then, the rationale for a 600 ship navy and US carriers in the northern Atlantic). Nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that US, British, French aircraft carriers are a colonial rule enforcement tool . You park one or two aircraft carrier battle groups a few hundred miles from a disobedient country, and you bomb the shit out of it until it rolls over. That is, in reality, the only rationale for these immense structures. And the beauty of it is that you can threaten most of the planet and that you do not depend on allies agreeing to your mission. So, we can say that US and other western aircraft carriers are a long range power projection capability to be used against weak and poorly defended countries. Why weak and poorly defended only? Here is the ugly secret that everybody knows: aircraft carriers cannot be defended against a sophisticated enemy. Had the Cold War turned hot, the Soviets would have simultaneously attacked any US carrier in the north Atlantic with a combo of Air launched cruise missiles Surface ship launched cruise missiles Submarine launcher torpedoes I cannot prove the following, but I can just testify that I had plenty of friends in the US military, including some who served on US aircraft carriers, and they all understood that US carriers would never survive a Soviet saturation attack and that in case of a real war they would have been kept away from the Soviet shores. I will only add here that the Chinese apparently have developed specialized ballistic missiles designed to destroy carrier battle groups. That was then, in the early 1990s. Nowadays even countries like Iran are beginning to develop capabilities to engage and successfully destroy US carriers. The Soviets never built any real aircraft carriers. What they had were *cruisers* with a very limited amount of vertically launched aircraft and, of course, helicopters. These cruisers had two main purposes: to extend the reach of the Soviet air defenses and to support a landing of a force from the sea. One very special feature of these aircraft carrying Soviet cruisers is that they had very large (4,5-7 tons) cruise missiles designed to strike at a high-value enemy ships, including US aircraft carriers. You can read up on the 'Kiev-class' aircraft carrying cruiser here . Another key characteristic of these Soviet aircraft-carrying cruisers is that they carried a rather lame aircraft, the Yak-38 which was plagued by problems and would have been a very easy target for US F-14. F-15, F-16 or F-18. For that reason, the Kiev-class air-defenses were centered on its surface-to-air missiles and not on its complement of aircraft. By the time the Kuznetsov was built, the Soviets had developed aircraft which were at least equal, if not superior, to their western counterparts: the MiG-29 and, especially, the SU-27. And that gave some of them the idea to build a 'real' aircraft carrier. T he decision to built the Kuznetsov was an extremely controversial one which faced a lot of opposition. The Kuznetsov's 'selling points' were that she was a much superior air defense platform, that she could carry vastly superior aircraft and, last but not least, that she could compete for prestige with the US heavy aircraft carriers, especially the planned but never built nuclear-powered follow-on generation. I find that argument wholly unconvincing and nowadays I am pretty confident that most Russian naval force planners would agree with me: Russia does not need US-style aircraft carriers and if she needs any aircraft carriers at all, then they would have to be designed around a *Russian* mission requirement and not just to copy the Americans. [Sidebar: I would love to get on my favorite soapbox and tell you all the bad things I think about aircraft carriers in general and why I think that the Russian Navy should be submarine and frigate centered, but this would take up too much space. I will just say that I much rather have many frigates or corvettes than a few heavy cruisers]. So the Kuznetsov ended up being a mega-compromise and, as compromises go, a pretty good one. Think of it: even though the Kuznetsov packs 12 massive Granit anti-ship missiles, it has, at least potentially, a complement of aircraft bigger than the French Charles de Gaulle (50 vs 40). Initially, the Kuznetsov carried 12 pure air to air SU-33, but now these will be gradually replaced with 20 much more modern MiG-29K and its 24 Ka-27 helicopters will be replaced by the most advanced reconnaissance and attack helicopter on the planet, the Ka-52K . The Kuznetsov still has two major weaknesses: a frankly dated propulsion system (see the Mercouris article) and a lack of on-board AWACs aircraft. The latter is a direct consequence of the design philosophy of the Kuznetsov which was never designed to operate much beyond 500-1000 km from the Russian border (again, the crucial roughly under 1000 km Russian force planning philosophy ). To sum this all up: the Kuznetsov is a fine aircraft carrier which nevertheless reflects a compromise design philosophy and which was never intended to project Russian power at long distances the way western, especially US, carriers have . Now let's turn to the rest of this Russian naval task force The rest of the Russian naval task force around the Kuznetsov One big name immediately stands out: the Heavy Nuclear Rocket Cruiser Peter the Great. The nuclear battle-cruiser Peter the Great This is one heavy beast and currently the most heavily armed ship on the planet. I won't even go into all the details here, check this article for a list of armaments if you are interested, suffice to say here that this battlecruiser can do everything: anti-air, anti-ship, anti-submarine. She is packed with top of the line sensors and advanced communications. Being the flagship of the Northern Fleet she is also the de-facto flagship of the entire Russian Navy. Last, but not least, the Peter the Great carries a formidable array of 20 Granit anti-ship missile. Please note that the combined firepower of Granit anti-ship missiles of the Kuznetsov and Peter the Great is 12+20 for a total of 32. I will explain why this is important below. The rest of the task force is composed of two Large Antisubmarine Ships (destroyers in western terminology), the Vice-Admiral Kulakov and the Severomorsk, and a number of support vessels. The Kulakov and the Severomorsk are based on the Udaloy design and are modern and all-around capable combat ships. All these ships will soon merge into one force, including two small missile ships (corvettes in western terminology) which carry the famous Kalibr cruise missiles and which specialize in attacking surface ships. Finally, though this will not be advertised, I believe that this task force will include at least two Akula-class nuclear attack submarines, one Oscar-II cruise missile submarine (armed with another 12 Granit cruise missiles) and several Kilo-class diesel-electric submarines. To sum this all up. The Russian naval task force is a Russian attempt to bring together a number of ships which were never designed to operate as a single naval task force far away from Russia. If you want, it is a clever Russian 'hack' . I would argue that it is also a rather successful one as this task force as a whole is a very impressive one. No, it cannot take on all of NATO or even the USN, but there are a number of things which it can do very effectively. Now we can turn to the big question, What can the Russian naval task force in Syria really do? The 7 ton Granit P-700 (3M45) Before looking at the bigger picture, there is one detail which I think deserves to be mentioned here. Just about every article I read about the Granit cruise missile says that it is an anti-ship cruise missile. I also wrote that above in order to keep things simple. But now I have to say that the Granit probably always had a 'B' mode, 'B' as in 'beregovoy' or, if you prefer, 'coastal' or 'land' mode. I don't know whether this mode existed from day 1 or whether it was added later, but it is now certain that the Granit has had such a mode. It was probably a fairly minimalistic capability, without fancy guidance and other tricks (which the Granit has in its main anti-ship mode), but the Russians have recently revealed that the upgraded Granits now have a *real* ('complex') land attack capability. And that requires a totally new look at what that means for this task force. This is what we know about the new and improved Granit (which the Russians refer to as 3M45): Mass: 7 tons Range: 500-600km Warhead: 750kg (conventional and nuclear capable) The Granit is also capable of some very advanced things, including having one missile flying at 500m or higher to detect the target and the rest of them skimming the surface while receiving the data from the high-flying one. These missiles are also capable of automatically attacking from different directions to better overwhelm air defenses. They can fly as low as 25m and as high as 17'000m. What this all means is that these Granits missiles are very capable tactical-operational range missiles of their own right . And considering that there are at the very least 32 such missiles in the Russian task force (46 if a Oscar-II class sub is also present), that means that this task force has a tactical missile firepower similar to an entire rocket brigade! Should things go very wrong, this task force could not only seriously threaten any USN/NATO surface ship within 500km of Syria, but also every single city or military base in this range . I am rather surprised that the western fear-mongers missed this one because it ought to scare NATO pretty badly :-) To be honest here, some specialists are expressing big doubts about the land-attack capabilities of the Granit. Everybody knows that these are relatively old and very expensive missiles, but nobody knows how much effort was really put in their modernization. But even if they are not nearly as capable as advertised, the fact that 32 to 46 of such missiles will be sitting just off the Syrian coast will be a formidable deterrent because nobody will never know what these missiles can do until they really do it. Next: T he combined capabilities of the Russian naval task force and the S-300/S-400 missiles deployed in Syria give the Russians a world-class air-defense capability. If needed the Russians could even throw in A-50 AWACs from Russia protected by MiG-31BMs. What most observers do not realize is that SA-N-6 'Grumble' which forms the core of the air defenses of the Peter the Great is a S-300FM, the modernized naval variant of the S-300 . It is also capable of the amazing Mach 6 speed, has a 150km range, an added infrared terminal capability, a track-via-missile guidance system which allows it to engage ballistic missiles and an altitude envelope of 27'000m. And, guess what ‚Äì the Peter the Great has 48 such missiles (in 20 launchers), roughly the equivalent of 12 S-300 batteries (assuming 4 launchers per battery). One of the major weaknesses of the Russian deployment in Syria has been the relative low number of missiles the Russians could fire at any one time. The US/NATO could simply saturate Russian defenses with large numbers of missiles. Frankly, they can still do it, but this has now become much, much harder. Can the Russians now stop a US attack on Syria? Probably not. But they can make it much harder and dramatically less effective. First, as soon as the Americans fire, the Russians will see it and they will warn the Syrian and Russian armed forces. Since the Russians will be able to track every US missile, they will be able to pass on the data to all the air defense crews who will be ready by the time the missiles arrive. Furthermore, once the missiles get close, the Russians will be able to shoot down a lot of them, making necessary for the Americans to conduct battle damage assessment from space and then re-strike the same targets many times over. Second, stealth or no stealth, I don't believe that the USN or the USAF will risk flying into Russian controlled airspace or, if it does, this will be a short-lived experiment. I believe that the Russian presence in Syria will make any attack on Syria a 'missile only' attack. Unless the Americans take down the Russian air defenses, which they could only if they want to start WWIII, US aircraft will have to stay outside the Syrian skies. And that means that the Russians have basically made their own no-fly zone over Syria and that a US no-fly zone is now impossible to achieve . Next, the Kuznetsov will be brining a number of fixed and rotary wing aircraft including 15-20 Ka-27 and Ka-52K helicopters, and 15-20 SU-33K and MiG-29K (I don't think there has been an official figure announced). What the Russians have said is that the fixed-wing aircraft will be upgraded to be able to attack ground targets. Will all that make a difference? Maybe, on the margins. It will definitely help dealing with the expected influx of moderate terrorists coming from Mosul (courtesy of the US operation to flush them down into Syria), but the Russians could have simply moved more SU-25 or even SU-34 to Khmeimin or Iran at a much smaller cost. Thus in terms of its air-wing, I fully agree with Mercouris ‚Äì this will be mainly a real-life training opportunity and not a game changer. Conclusion T his deployment is highly uncharacteristic of what the Russians have been training for. They have basically found a way to reinforce the Russian contingent in Syria, especially against Hillary's 'no fly zone' nightmare. However, this is also a case of making virtue out of necessity: the operation in Syria was always too far from the Russian border and the Russian force in Syria always too small for its task. Furthermore, this deployment is not sustainable in the long term, and the Russians know it. They have successfully imposed a 'Yankee no fly zone' over Syria long enough for the Syrian to take Aleppo and for the Americans to vote for their next President. After that, the situation will either get dramatically better (Trump) or dramatically worse (Hillary). Either way, the new situation will require a completely different Russian strategy. ‚ÄîThe Saker PS: I am aware of the semi-official Russian announced plans to build a modern aircraft carrier, probably a nuclear one, with catapults and all. For whatever it's worth, I am very much opposed to this idea which I find wasteful and which does not fit the Russian defense doctrine. The new generation of Russian subs (SSNs and SLBMs), however, gets my standing ovation.

ALEXANDER MERCOURIS | THE DURAN R ussia's use of its aircraft carrier in the Syrian conflict is principally intended to learn lessons for the design of more potent such warships in the future, rather than to change the situation in Syria itself. The Russian navy's deployment of   aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean has provoked a very confused response in the Western media. 
On the one hand it is described as a major escalation, as if   was a US style super carrier. On the other hand there has been a great of deal of derision , with the ship called an obsolete rust bucket dangerous mainly to its crew. Where does the truth lie? The Admiral Kuznetsov is the first and only Russian aircraft carrier capable of launching fighter aircraft conventionally. The preceding Kiev class carriers were smaller ships, which could only launch a small number of aircraft vertically. Contrary to what reports say, Admiral Kuznetsov is by the standards of navy carriers a relatively new ship. She was launched in 1985, commissioned in the then Soviet navy in 1990, but only became operational after prolonged trials in 1995. The US navy currently operates 10 Nimitz class supercarriers. If the age of a ship is determined by its date of launch; then three of the US navy's Nimitz class supercarriers are older than Kuznetsov; if by date of commission, then five are; if by entry into service then six are. The Russian navy had no previous experience of operating carriers, so the lengthy time scale of her sea trials between commission and entry into service is not surprising. In addition what undoubtedly extended this period before her full entry into service was the political and economic crisis Russia experienced during the 1990s. Given the severity of this crisis, it is a wonder a ship as large and complicated as Kuznetsov was brought into service at all. Either way talk of Kuznetsov as some sort of archaic ship from a bygone era is exaggerated, whilst jokes about Kuznetsov being ''¶.practically old enough to have been deployed in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war'¶.' are simply silly. The Admiral Kuznetsov is expected to deploy off Syria, carrying 15 warplanes, including new MiG-29K/KUB fighters and the Su-33a, shown here. Aircraft carriers as it happens tend to be long-lived ships. Coral Sea, a US Medway class carrier, served in the US Navy from 1947 to 1990. By the standards of aircraft carriers Kuznetsov is not an old ship. What is true about Kuznetsov is that because she was the first of a type of ship of which the Russians had no previous experience, and because of the fraught period during which she was commissioned and brought into service 'ì which made it impossible to sort out her teething problems properly 'ì Kuznetsov suffers by comparison with US navy carriers from design flaws and from engine problems. The ship's engines are unreliable, because they are insufficiently powerful for a ship of this size. The Russians when they built Kuznetsov lacked suitable nuclear reactors for this type of ship (they were designed for the intended follow-on Ulyanovsk carrier, which because of the 1990s crisis was however never built). They also lacked conventional engines large enough for a ship of this size, which was roughly twice as heavy as the largest other ship the Russian or Soviet navy had commissioned before. The Russians accordingly came up with a complicated solution of using multiple steam turbines and turbo-pressurised boilers to make up for the lack of power of the individual engines. Like all complicated arrangements, this arrangement is unreliable and prone to breakdown, with the engines experiencing stress especially in heavy seas. To compound the trouble with the engines, they were built by a plant in what is now independent Ukraine. As political relations between Russia and Ukraine deteriorated, servicing of the engines by this plant became increasingly erratic, and has now stopped completely. It is these problems with the engines that account for the practice of accompanying Kuznetsov on long range deployments with a tug. The tug in question 'ì the Nikolai Chiker 'ì is the most powerful tug in the world. This same tug played a key role in successfully hauling Kuznetsov's uncompleted sister ship Varyag from Ukraine to China in 2005, where she has now become the Chinese carrier Liaoning. The fact Kuznetsov is accompanied by a tug on long range deployments has provoked some derision. However it is common practice in any navy to accompany large surface warships with service ships, and accompanying Kuznetsov with a tug ensures in Kuznetsov's case that the carrier will get to where the Russian naval staff are sending it. The engine problems will not affect Kuznetsov's Mediterranean deployment when the carrier finally reaches its position. Kuznetsov suffers from other problems, which are unsurprising given that Kuznetsov is so much bigger and so different to any other ship the Russian navy has ever previously commissioned, and the unhappy times when it was launched. The arduous deployment of the Russian flotilla. Everything is harder for the Russians. (BBC) There are for example known to be problems with Kuznetsov's water pipes, which have a history of breakdowns and of freezing up in Arctic weather. These problems too however will not affect Kuznetsov's capabilities as a warship when the carrier finally reaches the eastern Mediterranean, and the close proximity of Russian bases in Sevastopol and Tartus means they can be dealt with quickly if they arise. Once this deployment is ended Kuznetsov will go through a lengthy refit, which unlike previous refits is intended to be practically a rebuild. With Russia developing a new range of much larger and more powerful engines, Kuznetsov's current unsatisfactory engines will finally be replaced, and the other teething problems like the problem with the water pipes will finally be addressed. Ultimately this is a potent warship, bigger than any other carrier other than those operated by the US navy, and once the refit is done it will be a powerful asset. In the meantime the ship already provides the Russian fleet with a carrier capability matched by no other navy apart from that of the US. 
The Russian carrier passing through the English Channel. In saying this it is important to stress however that the US navy carrier force 'ì with its 10 nuclear powered supercarriers 'ì dwarfs the capability of any other navy, including Russia's, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Neither the Kuznetsov, nor any other carrier the Russians might build, nor any other navy, can match or rival it. A more pertinent criticism of Kuznetsov is that though Kuznetsov is a large ship (at 55,000 tonnes standard weight and with a 305 metre length Kuznetsov is midway between a US Medway class carrier and a US Forrestal class supercarrier) the air group it carries at 40-50 aircraft is relatively small (by comparison a smaller US Medway class carrier carried an air group of 75-80 aircraft in the 1980s). This suggests that Kuznetsov is inefficient in its use of its spaces, a fact which again reflects Russian inexperience designing this sort of ship when Kuznetsov was built. However it also partly reflects differences in Kuznetsov's intended role. At the time Kuznetsov was built the Russians did not envisage using their carriers for the sort of long range carrier type operations carried out by the US navy. Unlike US navy supercarriers Kuznetsov prioritises air defence of the fleet rather than long range strikes. That explains why Kuznetsov's fighter aircraft take off from the carrier using a ski jump rather than steam catapults. Ski jump takeoffs put less stress on the pilots and shorten takeoff times, enabling more aircraft to take off from the carrier more quickly, which can be important in an air defence situation. The penalty is that aircraft are limited in the loads they can carry by comparison with aircraft launched by steam catapults. For air defence 'ì the purpose for which Kuznetsov was designed 'ì this is unimportant since fighter aircraft carrying out air defence missions only carry light air to air missiles rather than heavy air to ground missiles and bombs. However it does significantly reduce the air group's capability to carry out long range strikes. Combined with the relatively small size of the air group, this means that Kuznetsov's ability to carry out long range ground strikes is fractional compared to that of a US navy supercarrier. If Kuznetsov is not really designed to carry out long range ground strikes, why are the Russians deploying Kuznetsov off the coast of Syria? The plan to deploy Kuznetsov to the eastern Mediterranean was made many months ago, long before the recent collapse in relations with the US over Syria. The decision therefore can have nothing to do with deterring the US from declaring a no fly zone over Syria, as some people are suggesting. Most likely the intention is to gain experience operating aircraft against ground targets from an offshore carrier. This is not something the Russians have ever done before. Even if Kuznetsov's capability to do it by comparison with a US navy supercarrier is marginal, the fighting in Syria does at least give the Russians an opportunity to try it out to find out how it is done and what it involves. That way they can learn lessons that will help them with the design of the far more powerful ships that are to come (see here and here ). In other words the deployment of the Kuznetsov to the eastern Mediterranean is essentially a training exercise. It does not merit either the derision or the hype that has been created around it.

Bernays affiliation with his kin, Freud, helped him establish his credentials as a manipulator. T he American journalist, Edward Bernays, is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda. The nephew of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psycho-analysis, it was Bernays who coined the term 'public relations' as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions. In 1929, he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade 'ì behaviour then considered outlandish. One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, 'Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!' Bernays' influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War. The secret, he said, was 'engineering the consent' of people in order to 'control and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it'. He described this as 'the true ruling power in our society' and called it an 'invisible government'. Today, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged. Imagine two cities. Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people. But there is a vital difference. In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them, who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes. There are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory. There is scant mention of civilian casualties. In the second city 'ì in another country nearby 'ì almost exactly the same is happening. Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics. The difference is that these fanatics are supported, supplied and armed by 'us' 'ì by the United States and Britain. They even have a media centre that is funded by Britain and America. Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad guys, condemned for assaulting and bombing the city 'ì which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city. Confusing? Not really. Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda. I am referring, of course, to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq, who are backed by the United States and Britain and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria, backed by Russia. One is good; the other is bad. W hat is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003. That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria. Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news, the monstrous ISIS and Al-Qaida and al-Nusra and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist, and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today. Some may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that Blair was 'vindicated' for what turned out to be the crime of the century. The US television networks produced the same validation for George W. Bush. Fox News brought on Henry Kissinger to effuse over Colin Powell's fabrications. The same year, soon after the invasion, I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis, the renowned American investigative journalist. I asked him, 'What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda?' He replied that if journalists had done their job, 'there is a very, very good chance we would not have gone to war in Iraq'. It was a shocking statement, and one supported by other famous journalists to whom I put the same question 'î Dan Rather of CBS, David Rose of the Observer and journalists and producers in the BBC, who wished to remain anonymous. In other words, had journalists done their job, had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying it, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children would be alive today, and there would be no ISIS and no siege of Aleppo or Mosul. There would have been no atrocity on the London Underground on 7 th July 2005. There would have been no flight of millions of refugees; there would be no miserable camps. When the terrorist atrocity happened in Paris last November, President Francois Hollande immediately sent planes to bomb Syria 'ì and more terrorism followed, predictably, the product of Hollande's bombast about France being 'at war' and 'showing no mercy'. That state violence and jihadist violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak. 'When the truth is replaced by silence,' said the Soviet dissident Yevtushenko, 'the silence is a lie.' The attack on Iraq, the attack on Libya, the attack on Syria happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the West. The human rights record of a Saddam or a Gaddafi was irrelevant. They did not obey orders and surrender control of their country. The same fate awaited Slobodan Milosevic once he had refused to sign an 'agreement' that demanded the occupation of Serbia and its conversion to a market economy. His people were bombed, and he was prosecuted in The Hague. Independence of this kind is intolerable. As WikiLeaks has revealed, it was only when the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2009 rejected an oil pipeline, running through his country from Qatar to Europe, that he was attacked. From that moment, the CIA planned to destroy the government of Syria with jihadist fanatics 'ì the same fanatics currently holding the people of Mosul and eastern Aleppo hostage. Why is this not news? The former British Foreign Office official Carne Ross, who was responsible for operating sanctions against Iraq, told me: 'We would feed journalists factoids of sanitised intelligence, or we would freeze them out. That is how it worked.' The West's medieval client, Saudi Arabia 'ì to which the US and Britain sell billions of dollars' worth of arms 'ì is at present destroying Yemen, a country so poor that in the best of times, half the children are malnourished. Look on YouTube and you will see the kind of massive bombs 'ì 'our' bombs 'ì that the Saudis use against dirt-poor villages, and against weddings, and funerals. The explosions look like small atomic bombs. The bomb aimers in Saudi Arabia work side-by-side with British officers. This fact is not on the evening news. Propaganda is most effective when our consent is engineered by those with a fine education 'ì Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Columbia 'î and with careers on the BBC, the Guardia n, the New York Times , the Washington Post . These organisations are known as the liberal media. They present themselves as enlightened, progressive tribunes of the moral zeitgeist. They are anti-racist, pro-feminist and pro-LGBT. And they love war. While they speak up for feminism, they support rapacious wars that deny the rights of countless women, including the right to life. In 2011, Libya, then a modern state, was destroyed on the pretext that Muammar Gaddafi was about to commit genocide on his own people. That was the incessant news; and there was no evidence. It was a lie. In fact, Britain, Europe and the United States wanted what they like to call 'regime change' in Libya, the biggest oil producer in Africa. Gaddafi's influence in the continent and, above all, his independence were intolerable. So he was murdered with a knife in his rear by fanatics, backed by America, Britain and France. Hillary Clinton cheered his gruesome death for the camera, declaring, 'We came, we saw, he died!' The destruction of Libya was a media triumph. As the war drums were beaten, Jonathan Freedland wrote in the Guardian : 'Though the risks are very real, the case for intervention remains strong.' Intervention 'î what a polite, benign, Guardian word, whose real meaning, for Libya, was death and destruction. According to its own records, Nato launched 9,700 'strike sorties' against Libya, of which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets. They included missiles with uranium warheads. Look at the photographs of the rubble of Misurata and Sirte, and the mass graves identified by the Red Cross. The Unicef report on the children killed says, 'most [of them] under the age of ten'. As a direct consequence, Sirte became the capital of ISIS. Ukraine is another media triumph. Respectable liberal newspapers such as the New York Times , the Washington Post and the Guardian , and mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC, NBC, CBS, CNN have played a critical role in conditioning their viewers to accept a new and dangerous cold war. All have misrepresented events in Ukraine as a malign act by Russia when, in fact, the coup in Ukraine in 2014 was the work of the United States, aided by Germany and Nato. This inversion of reality is so pervasive that Washington's military intimidation of Russia is not news; it is suppressed behind a smear and scare campaign of the kind I grew up with during the first cold war. Once again, the Ruskies are coming to get us, led by another Stalin, whom The Economist depicts as the devil. The suppression of the truth about Ukraine is one of the most complete news blackouts I can remember. The fascists who engineered the coup in Kiev are the same breed that backed the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Of all the scares about the rise of fascist anti-Semitism in Europe, no leader ever mentions the fascists in Ukraine 'ì except Vladimir Putin, but he does not count. Many in the Western media have worked hard to present the ethnic Russian-speaking population of Ukraine as outsiders in their own country, as agents of Moscow, almost never as Ukrainians seeking a federation within Ukraine and as Ukrainian citizens resisting a foreign-orchestrated coup against their elected government. There is almost the joie d'esprit of a class reunion of warmongers. The drum-beaters of the Washington Post inciting war with Russia are the very same editorial writers who published the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. To most of us, the American presidential campaign is a media freak show, in which Donald Trump is the arch villain. But Trump is loathed by those with power in the United States for reasons that have little to do with his obnoxious behaviour and opinions. To the invisible government in Washington, the unpredictable Trump is an obstacle to America's design for the 21 st century. This is to maintain the dominance of the United States and to subjugate Russia, and, if possible, China. To the militarists in Washington, the real problem with Trump is that, in his lucid moments, he seems not to want a war with Russia; he wants to talk with the Russian president, not fight him; he says he wants to talk with the president of China. In the first debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump promised not to be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into a conflict. He said, 'I would certainly not do first strike. Once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.' That was not news. Did he really mean it? Who knows? He often contradicts himself. But what is clear is that Trump is considered a serious threat to the status quo maintained by the vast national security machine that runs the United States, regardless of who is in the White House. The CIA wants him beaten. The Pentagon wants him beaten. The media wants him beaten. Even his own party wants him beaten. He is a threat to the rulers of the world 'ì unlike Clinton who has left no doubt she is prepared to go to war with nuclear-armed Russia and China. Clinton has the form, as she often boasts. Indeed, her record is proven. As a senator, she backed the bloodbath in Iraq. When she ran against Obama in 2008, she threatened to 'totally obliterate' Iran. As Secretary of State, she colluded in the destruction of governments in Libya and Honduras and set in train the baiting of China. She has now pledged to support a No Fly Zone in Syria 'î a direct provocation for war with Russia. Clinton may well become the most dangerous president of the United States in my lifetime 'ìa distinction for which the competition is fierce. Without a shred of evidence, she has accused Russia of supporting Trump and hacking her emails. Released by WikiLeaks, these emails tell us that what Clinton says in private, in speeches to the rich and powerful, is the opposite of what she says in public. That is why silencing and threatening Julian Assange is so important. As the editor of WikiLeaks, Assange knows the truth. And let me assure those who are concerned, he is well, and WikiLeaks is operating on all cylinders. Today, the greatest build-up of American-led forces since World War Two is under way 'ì in the Caucasus and eastern Europe, on the border with Russia, and in Asia and the Pacific, where China is the target. Keep that in mind when the presidential election circus reaches its finale on November 8 th, If the winner is Clinton, a Greek chorus of witless commentators will celebrate her coronation as a great step forward for women. None will mention Clinton's victims: the women of Syria, the women of Iraq, the women of Libya. None will mention the civil defence drills being conducted in Russia. None will recall Edward Bernays' 'torches of freedom'. George Bush's press spokesman once called the media 'complicit enablers'. Coming from a senior official in an administration whose lies, enabled by the media, caused such suffering, that description is a warning from history. In 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor said of the German media: 'Before every major aggression, they initiated a press campaign calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the German people psychologically for the attack. In the propaganda system, it was the daily press and the radio that were the most important weapons.' This is adapted from an address to the Sheffield Festival of Words, Sheffield, England.

[Graphic from the Dorian Gray Wiki Project .] =By= Edward Curtin 'They didn't act like people and they didn't act like actors. It's hard to explain.' J.D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye 'Eleanor Rigby'¶Lives in a dream/Waits at the window, wearing a face/That she keeps in a jar by the door/Who is it for?' The Beatles, Eleanor Rigby Editor's Note The analogy of the mask and the role it plays in our lives provides fertile ground for discussion of this (endless) political season. That each of us plays some role in this farce (in the classic sense of that word) is an important recognition. More than any election in my lifetime I have heard 'you can't make this shit up.' A classic statement of life imitating art imitating fantastical life. Unfortunately, for many of us, myself included, this feels more like a nightmare from which I cannot wake myself. There is a world in the balance. One could say that there always in when dealing with a deck stacked with the arsenal of the United States. However, now we are dealing with an unfolding environmental catastrophe which will leave more dead than we can count. The new estimate from the World Wildlife Fund is that two-thirds of the world's wildlife will be extinct by 2020. That is less than 4 years. Those species deaths will certainly be accompanied by the decimation of countless human lives as well. So pick your stage and which play is real. T he idiocy of the Presidential election race will soon be over, as will the endless pseudo-debates and the droning of the commentators, who have been prattling on for more than a year, as if there were something to consider about this sick farce; as if the deep state had not been directing this life-movie from the start.
Gore Vidal got a laugh when years ago he referred to Ronald Reagan as our 'acting president.' But we've had four acting presidents since and their acts have left millions dead and wounded around the globe, including thousands of American troops. Now we have the sordid spectacle of an election campaign that is so patently phony that 'delusionary' is the only word that can describe the thinking of those who take it seriously. Many Americans have acquiesced in this ongoing tragedy, playing their parts in this deadly charade. The ghosts of all America's victims walk among us, and they will haunt us until we come to life by admitting our own complicity in their deaths. The show must not go on, but it will, as long as we keep acting our parts. 
Norman O. Brown so well describes our stage set: 'Ancestral voices prophesying war; ancestral spirits in the danse macabre or war dance; Valhalla, ghostly warriors who kill each other and are reborn to fight again. All warfare is ghostly, every army an exercitus feralis (army of ghosts), every soldier a living corpse.' 
The Obama administration repeatedly sets the stage by talking about and waging an endless war, a thirty year war, a long struggle, an open-ended war. Soon Obama's feral, war loving understudy, Hillary Clinton, will take center stage as he exits right, after promoting her. 'This is not me going through the motions here,' he recently said. 'I really, really, really want to elect Hillary Clinton.' The role-playing, black face of empire will be replaced by the role-playing female face of empire as the audience cheers, hiding from their masked selves their part in a face-saving, phony performance. Without a complicit audience, the performance can't go on. But it does, or, as Kurt Vonnegut put it, 'so it goes.' But the act is wearing thin. 
The autumnal season and especially the Halloween weekend of ghosts, the dead, and masks has me thinking of my own experience with acting, and how understanding the nature of our complicity in a mass act of bad faith is so important. 
Having grown up as the only brother among seven sisters, I was always my parents' favorite son. With such dumb luck, I never felt the need to be someone I wasn't and so accepted my favored fate. But from an early age I learned from my sisters what it meant to 'put on your face.' Like most girls in a cosmetic culture, they would stand or sit in front of a mirror dutifully applying lipstick, cover-up, and mascara (Italian, maschera , mask) in preparation for their entrances onto the social stage where they would face so many other faces facing and eyeing them. Mirrors meeting mirrors, looking-glass selves. It seemed to the boy I was, such an exhausting act. 
At the time I had only a dim awareness of life the movie. 
Then, when I was a young teenager, I had the great opportunity to learn how to be a public phony and put on a face. I got to lie to a national television audience and got paid for my deception. The show was a very popular one 'ì To Tell the Truth 'ì one of many game shows my parents, sisters, and I appeared on. We were a 'theatrical' family, not trained actors, but a brood of faces unconsciously hoping to discover who they were through their acts. My parents had started this by accepting an invitation to appear on a show hosted by Johnny Carson, Do You Trust Your Wife? (The show was later renamed Who Do You Trust? 'ì an apt, albeit grammatically incorrect, appellation for the paranoid Cold War years.) But I didn't then care about politics; I just wanted to put on a good face and lie well while ostensibly telling the truth. I succeeded by convincing two of the celebrity panelists that I was who I wasn't 'ì Robert McGee 'ì and getting paid $250 for my act. Lying seemed so easy; all you needed was a good mask and a convincing demeanor. This was my public lesson in 'putting on your face.' 
Ever since then, I've been fascinated by masks, liars, and the role of acting on the social stage. Ghosts of the Past by Ian Kath. 
As the Halloween weekend transpires, this enchantment increases. I think of how all persons are, by definition, masked, the word 'person' being derived from the Latin, persona, meaning mask. Another Latin word, larva, occurs to me, it too meaning mask, ghost, or evil spirit. The living masks light up for me as I think of ghosts, the dead, all the souls and spirits circulating through our days. While etymology might seem arcane, I rather think it offers us a portal into our lives, not just personally, but politically and culturally as well. Shakespeare was right, of course, 'all the world's a stage,' though I would disagree with the bard that we are 'merely' players. It does often seem that way, but seeming is the essence of the actor's show and tell. But who are we behind the masks? Who is it uttering those words coming through the masks' mouth holes (the per-sona , Latin, to sound through). 
Halloween. The children play at scaring and being scared. Death walks among them and they scream with glee. The play is on. The grim reaper walks up and down the street. Treats greet them. The costumes are ingenious; the masks, wild. The parents stand behind, watching, smiling. It's all great fun, the candy sweet. So what's the trick? When does the performance end? 
As Halloween ends, the saints come marching in followed by all the souls. The Days of the Dead. Spirits. Ghosts walk the streets. Dead leaves fall. The dead are everywhere, swirling through the air, drifting. We are surrounded by them. We are them. Until. 
Until when? Perhaps not until we dead awaken and see through the charade of social life and realize the masked performers are not just the deadly politicians and celebrities, not only the professional actors and the corporate media performers, but us. 
Lying is the leading cause of living death in the United States, and the pharmaceutical companies have no prescription for this one. Not yet, anyway, as far as I care to know. 
It seems to me that Albert Camus was right, and that we should aspire to be neither victims nor executioners. To do so will take a serious reevaluation of the roles we play in the ongoing national tragedy of lie piled upon lie in aggressive wars around the world and in election farces that perpetuate them. The leading actors we elect are our responsibility. We produce and maintain them. They are our mirror images; we, theirs. It is the danse macabre , a last tango in the land of bad actors, our two-faced show. This masquerade ball that passes for political reality is infiltrated by the ghosts of all those victims we have murdered around the wide world. We may choose not to see them, but they are lurking in the shadowy corners. And they will haunt us until we make amends. 
'Do you not know there comes a midnight hour when everyone has to throw off his mask?' warned Kierkegaard, 'Do you believe that life will always let itself be mocked? Do you think you can slip away a little before midnight in order to avoid this? Or are you not terrified by it?' 
'Whenever I take up a newspaper,' Ibsen added, 'I seem to see ghosts gliding between the lines. There must be ghosts all the country over, as thick as the sands of the sea. And then we are, one and all, so pitifully afraid of the light.'

TJC: Please tell us about your new film, The Coming War on China . JP: The Coming War on China is my 60th film and perhaps one of the most urgent. It continues the theme of illuminating the imposition of great power behind a facade of propaganda as news. In 2011, President Obama announced a 'pivot to Asia' of US forces: almost two-thirds of American naval power would be transferred to Asia and the Pacific by 2020. The undeclared rationale for this was the 'threat' from China, by some measure now the greatest economic power. The Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, says US policy is to confront those 'who see America's dominance and want to take that away from us'. The film examines power in both countries and how nuclear weapons, in American eyes, are the bedrock of its dominance. In its first 'chapter', the film reveals how most of the population of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific were unwittingly made into nuclear guinea pigs in a programme whose secrets 'ì and astonishing archive 'ì are related to the presence of a missile base now targeting China. The Coming War on China will be released in cinemas in the UK on December 1st and broadcast on ITV (in the UK) on December 6th. TJC: How do you assess Australia's role in America's 'Pivot to Asia'? JP: Australia is virtually the 51st state of the US. Although China is Australia's biggest trader, on which much of the national economy relies, 'confronting China' is the diktat from Washington. The Australian political establishment, especially the military and intelligence agencies, are fully integrated into what is known as the 'alliance', along with the dominant Murdoch media. I often feel a certain sadness about the way my own country 'ì with all its resources and opportunities 'ì seems locked into such an unnecessary, dangerous obsequious role in the world. If the 'pivot' proceeds, Australia could find itself fighting, yet again, a great power's war. TJC: With regards to the British and American media, how can the US get away with selling China as a threat when it is encircling China? Obama and vassal leader Abe: Nothing that this duo plots is good for humanity. JP: That's a question that goes to the heart of modern-day propaganda. China is encircled by a 'noose' of some 400 US bases, yet the news has ignored this while concentrating on the 'threat' of China building airstrips on disputed islets in the South China Sea, clearly as a defence to a US Navy blockade. TJC: Obama's visit to Japan, and particularly to Hiroshima, was a really cynical act. What was your impression of Japan and the political situation there? JP: Japan is an American colony in all but name 'ì certainly in terms of its relationship with the rest of the world and especially China. The historian Bruce Cumings explores this in an interview in the film. Within the constraints of American dominance, indeed undeterred by Washington, Japan's current prime minister Shinzo Abe has developed an extreme nationalist position, in which contrition for Japanese actions in the Second World War is anathema and the post-war 'peace constitution' is likely to be changed. Abe has gone as far as boasting that Japan will use nuclear weapons if it wants. In any US conflict with China, Japan 'ì which last year announced its biggest ever 'defence' budget 'ì would play a critical role. There are 32 US military installations on the Japanese island of Okinawa, facing China. However, there is a sense in modern Asia that power in the world has indeed moved east and peaceful 'Asian solutions' to regional animosities are possible. TJC: Do you think the new trade and investment deals like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and especially the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) will affect China's business operations? JP: It's difficult to say, but I doubt it. What is remarkable about the rise of China is the way it has built, almost in the blink of an eye, a trade, investment and banking structure that rivals that of the Bretton Woods institutions. Unknown to many of us, China is developing its 'New Silk Road' to Europe at an astonishing pace. China's response to threats from Washington is a diplomacy that's tied to this development, and which includes a burgeoning alliance with Russia. This interview was originally published by the Plymouth Institute for Peace Research . NOTE:   T.J. Coles is the author of Britain's Secret Wars (2016, Clairview Books).

BY ANDREW LEVINE I trust that I am not the only one to have noticed that in rural areas and economically distressed neighborhoods in towns and cities, lawn signs for Donald Trump are everywhere, while Hillary signs are rarer than Teslas and Maseratis. I think I understand the Trump signs: they are cries of defiance. Hillary's supporters are harder to figure out. I suspect that most of them would just as soon not advertise their intentions November 8. Even if they think that there is no other way to stop Trump, they understand that, by voting for Hillary, they are embarrassing themselves. Lawn signs apart, the evidence that Trump is kaput is, by now, overwhelming. He seems finally to have done his campaign in 'ì to such an extent that even diehard anti-Trump fear mongers concede the inevitability of the Clintons' return to the White House. Trump's campaign had been on life support for weeks when the pussy grabbing tape surfaced, followed by a seemingly endless stream of women 'ì a dozen or so already 'î accusing the Donald of groping them and worse. Then, in the third debate, Trump announced that he would 'wait and see' before accepting the legitimacy of a Clinton victory. This seems to have been the final straw for all but the most bona fide 'deplorables.' And so, the writing is on the wall: Hillary will win just as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow 'ì well, not quite, but almost. There is no reason to rejoice in her victory, only in Trump's defeat. Hillary's supporters are in denial, and even people who know better than to support her for her own sake remain determined to waste their votes by adding to her totals. Apparently, they think that this is a way to send the message that Trumpian 'fascism' shall not pass. How much better it would be if they would use their votes to build alternatives to the neoliberal perpetual war regime that Hillary and Bill and their co-thinkers have helped fashion! The best chance for that, at this point, is Jill Stein's campaign on the Green Party ticket. Stein cannot win, of course; a vote for her is only a protest vote. But there is nothing wrong with that. Hillary needs to know that she has no mandate to end the world 'as we know it,' and this is one of many ways to convey that message. And even that isn't as obvious as it seems . Hillary probably the lesser evil all things considered. But Trump is very likely the less dangerous of the two. The man is an adolescent in a septuagenarian's body, with a tendency to act out. But at least he is not a Russophobe or a neocon or a 'humanitarian' intervener intent on regime change in countries that resist American domination. This would include not only the usual victims, countries incapable of harming the United States militarily, but Russia and China as well. It is relevant too that the supposed lesser evil is a committed neoliberal and a Wall Street toady, and that Trump's 'crooked Hillary' taunts hit the target more often than not. These considerations, and others like them, should cause concern to those who are fine with lesser evil voting in general, but who think that there are thresholds beneath which lesser evil considerations should not apply. There is no need to agonize over these issues, however; not in this case. When Trump became the Republican nominee, lesser evil arguments became moot. This would still be the case even if more voters were not quite so willfully blind to the dangers inherent in Clinton's determination to maintain American world domination by any means necessary, and to her fondness for military 'solutions.' Lesser evil considerations are irrelevant because Trump is and always has been bound to lose to any Democrat, even to her. I have been pressing this point and its corollary 'î that anti-Trump hysteria is a distraction 'ì from Day One. As recently as a month ago, hardly anyone agreed with me. If only I had a dollar for every time I have been taken to task for not seeing the parallels between the Trump phenomenon and the rise of Nazism in the final years of the Weimar Republic! I would be a rich man today. But because it is now recognized that Trump's chances of becoming President are, for all practical purposes, nil, no one is pressing that line these days. I used to be out on a limb; I no longer am. It would be only natural to take pleasure in this turn of events, and I would 'î but for the fact that a Trump defeat implies a Clinton victory. That prospect is, at best, only slightly less nightmarish. Worse, it doesn't seem to matter that all but the most flagrant worrywarts now finally concede that there will never be a President Trump. Liberals and centrists and even a few foolish leftists are still going all out for Hillary. From the dead center to the soft left, the consensus view is still that now is a time to boost, not knock, Hillary's campaign 'î especially in the dozen or so states where the Electoral College outcomes could not have been determined years ago with absolute certainty. It is remarkable that so many people cannot let anti-Trump hysteria go; that they are so focused on Trump's misogyny, temperamental instability, and narcissistic blather that they don't see that the only thing we need fear, where Trump is concerned, is, so to speak, the fear itself. However, in Hillary's case, there really is something to fear: that she is about to become the Commander-in-Chief of the most lethal military force in the history of the world. On that point, her supporters are in denial, and even people who know better than to support her for her own sake remain determined to waste their votes by adding to her totals. Apparently, they think that this is a way to send the message that Trumpian 'fascism' shall not pass. How much better it would be if they would use their votes to build alternatives to the neoliberal perpetual war regime that Hillary and Bill and their co-thinkers have helped fashion! The best chance for that, at this point, is Jill Stein's campaign on the Green Party ticket. Stein cannot win, of course; a vote for her is only a protest vote. But there is nothing wrong with that. Hillary needs to know that she has no mandate to end the world 'as we know it,' and this is one of many ways to convey that message. Pundits who claim otherwise are dead wrong. Those who pile on for Hillary are wasting their votes; protest votes aimed at Hillary are not wasted at all. I would imagine that at least some Trump voters are thinking along similar lines. But the racism, nativism and Islamophobia of their candidate tarnishes the messages their votes will convey. They therefore cannot register with any real clarity. The message protest votes for Stein convey is, on the other hand, as clear and distinct as can be. And if she garners at least five percent of the total votes cast, the Greens will have access to federal funding in future elections, and will have a much easier time gaining ballot access in all fifty states. This would not make for much of a 'political revolution,' even in Bernie Sanders' highly attenuated sense of the term, but it would make future elections less mind-numbing and degrading, and it could ultimately lead to more far-reaching transformations of the political scene. Now that Trump has all but killed off the GOP, the duopoly party system is in jeopardy, and all kinds of political realignments have, at last, become feasible. *** I wasn't just being contrarian when I went out on a limb about Trump's chances; and my confidence was in no way based on inferences from polling data or statistical extrapolations. Let the blogosphere's 'political junkies' and the corporate media's talking heads knock themselves out with that. What they do is useful only for entertaining people who care about the horse race aspect of presidential elections. It is distressing how many Americans indulge in that spectator sport. Most of them are essentially apolitical. I was confident that I was right about Trump's chances because I knew that what people tell pollsters when an election seems far off is basically irrelevant for predicting the election's outcome. Information about how they and people like them voted in the past is more relevant, but not by much. This is especially true when, as in this case, disdain for one or the other candidate, or for both, is a dispositive factor in many voters' minds. I was also fairly sure that, rightly or wrongly, more people fear and loathe Trump than fear and loathe Hillary; and that, if they didn't at the outset, they would before long 'ì because Trump was all but certain to undermine himself, and because there is so much dirt out there on the Donald's sleazy connections and moral turpitude that even God-fearing Republicans, capable of believing almost any nonsense, were bound eventually to be repulsed. I suspected too that Trump never really wanted to be President; that he only got into the race to promote his brand, and because he is an egotist and publicity-hound. Trump hates to lose, however 'î especially to the likes of Hillary 'î and so, at some point, he must have decided to give the campaign his all, even if it meant bringing the Trump brand down with him. Should it come to that, I will shed crocodile tears for his brood, Ivanka especially. A worthwhile thing to do in the months ahead would be to work to make that happen; to do everything possible to assure that the damage done to all things Trump will be irreversible. What a delightful irony that would be! There are plenty of Hillary-haters in the Donald's base who hate Hillary because they consider her the embodiment of coercive goody-goodyism, or because they think she is disdainful of people like them (people in the 'deplorables' demographic), or because they think that she is too leftwing. The idea that she is too leftwing is nonsense, of course; she is not nearly leftwing enough. That anyone would think otherwise is a testament to the media's ability to shape public perceptions and to the degree of political ignorance rampant in some quarters of the American electorate. But 'vast rightwing conspiracy' Hillary-haters are spot on right about the rest of it 'î and two out of three isn't bad. Even so, there are better reasons than theirs to dread the prospect of a Clinton presidency. They all have to do with the service Hillary has done, and will go on doing, for the miscreants who control the commanding heights of America's and the world's capitalist order, and with her untrammeled, ideologically-driven bellicosity. Hillary knows how to game the system; and she and Bill know how to benefit from doing so. But, for all her vaunted 'experience,' she is clueless about the world. And although she and her fans boast of her 'pragmatism,' that woman is seriously inept. Most of what she undertakes to do is ill conceived, and nearly all of it turns out badly. In short, the lesser evil, if that is what she is, is a very great evil indeed. It won't take long, once she moves back into the White House and starts putting her stamp on the empire's depredations, for the scales to fall from the eyes of all but her most gullible supporters. I am even more sure of this than I was of Trump's defeat, but I will take even less joy in being proved right again. What lies ahead, with Hillary in control, is too horrible to contemplate.

Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN I t doesn't matter. The Clintons are untouchable. Despite clear evidence of war crimes, racketeering, perjury, and Hillary's email scandal, along with suspicion of murder, and who knows what else, they're heading back to the White House in January. Electoral rigging virtually assures it. FBI director James Comey's announced revisiting of Hillary's use of her private email server to maintain and send classified information won't derail her presidential bid. .. Last July, Comey whitewashed her criminality 'ì serious enough to send ordinary people to prison. At the time, Trump was right, saying she 'compromised the safety of the American people by storing highly classified information on a private email server with no security.' .. 'Our adversaries almost certainly have a blackmail file on (her), and this fact alone disqualified her from service.' She was caught red-handed lying to the FBI and Congress 'ì claiming she didn't use her home server to maintain or send classified information. Comey confirmed over 100 emails were classified when sent, including top secret ones 'ì maybe hundreds more we haven't heard about or not yet discovered. .. Deleting thousands of emails compounded her criminality. Yet her road to the White House remains on track. Still, Comey's Friday announcement was astonishing, less than two weeks before November's election, an unprecedented act Trump will try using to his advantage 'ì though likely no more successfully than earlier. .. Comey's letter was disturbingly vague, suggesting having absolved Hillary's criminality once, he'll do it again. Announced 'investigative steps' take time 'ì likely concluding next year after November's election and January's inauguration. Here's his letter to FBI employees explaining his action: .. 'This morning I sent a letter to Congress in connection with the Secretary Clinton email investigation. Yesterday, the investigative team briefed me on their recommendation with respect to seeking access to emails that have recently been found in an unrelated case.' .. 'Because those emails appear to be pertinent to our investigation, I agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review them.' .. 'Of course, we don't ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed. I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.' .. 'At the same time, however, given that we don't know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don't want to create a misleading impression.' .. 'In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it.' Judicial Watch (JW) has done important work, trying to have Hillary held accountable for her scandalous email practices 'ì criminality without punishment so far, unlikely to change ahead, especially if she's anointed in November to succeed Obama, a near-certainty as things now stand. .. In response to Comey's announcement, JW president Tom Fitton issued the following statement: .. ' The FBI's seeming decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified information is astonishing. Once again, we suspect our Freedom of Information Act and other investigations have spurred the FBI to act. This decision highlights the corruption, favoritism, and incompetence in the FBI/Justice Department investigation of Hillary Clinton.' .. Her 'email misconduct and lies, aided and abetted by the Obama administration, have created a national crisis. The FBI needs to disclose more information about what it found and when 'ì the American voters deserve answers now.' .. 'Judicial Watch helped break open the Clinton email scandal and, no matter what the FBI does, will independently continue its historic litigation and investigation.' U S voters go to the polls in 10 days. Millions already voted in advance. Things were likely rigged way ahead of November 8. Hillary is the establishment choice. Power brokers running America picked her last year to succeed Obama. Trump surprisingly emerged last man standing among a deplorable array of GOP aspirants, resembling a police lineup 'ì or an FBI most wanted list. .. Bill and Hillary Clinton belong in prison, not high office for a third co-presidential term. Given everything publicly known, they remain irreparably tainted, a disturbing indictment of a political process too debauched to fix. Voters have no say over who leads them. Powerful interests decide everything. Democracy in America is pure fantasy, not the real thing. .. The only solution is grassroots revolution. Nothing else can work.

[Photo: Chiquibul Forest Reserve near Guatemalan border: top showing significant illegal clear cuts. while the bottom shows the beginnings of cutting. Credit: Tony Rath .] =By= Jeff Abott Editor's Note The forests, waterways, and tribal homelands are under growing threat across Latin and South America. Increasingly, the indigenous peoples are taking strong stands against the illegal activities, as well as the government sponsored intrusions into the Reserves. It seems that they are virtually the only ones willing to stand in the way of the decimation of their homelands, and of the wild rainforest on which out planet depends. The rainforest is essentially the lungs of the planet and it is being continuously destroyed. A cross Guatemala, indigenous communities are organizing to challenge logging in the country's vast forests. These communities are concerned with the impact that both legal and illegal logging will have on their watersheds and on the environment.
On June 15, concerned residents from the highland Ixil Maya municipality of Nebaj, Quiche staged a protest outside the municipal building to express their concern with the steady increase in trucks leaving town loaded with lumber. 
The action was organized by residents and members of the Indigenous Authority of Nebaj in order to pressure the state authorities to strip the nine companies of their licenses to exploit timber on private lands. Residents raised concern over the fact that the deforestation affects everyone in the area. 
Following the protest, concerned residents in the neighboring Ixil municipality of Chajul blocked and detained several trucks transporting lumber from the region for a number of hours. They demanded that the National Institute of Forests, or INAB, and the Division for the Protection of the Environment cease their operations and described the amount of lumber being taken from the local forests as 'excessive.' 
The Indigenous Authorities of Nebaj also issued a statement to INAB asking them to take action. But the government body declined to act and issued a statement that they are planting new trees for every one that is cut down. But this response did not satisfy concerned residents. 'We went to the government bodies and issued statements asking to cease extending licenses for the exploitation of forests,' said Caty Terraza, the communications representative for the Indigenous Authorities of Nebaj. 'They told us that they are sowing new trees, but how long will it take for those trees to grow to the same size as the trees that were there before?' 
The companies involved in logging operations responded to the protests by significantly reducing the number of trucks transporting lumber from mountains. According to residents, however, it is unclear if this will continue into the future. 
The mobilization of communities organizing to challenge logging operations in the highlands of Guatemala represent a growing concern over the destruction of the environment by companies. This challenge to logging companies reflects the understanding of communities of the vital part forests play in the protection of the water sources. 
'The trees serve us and the animals,' Terraza said. 'The loss of trees is drying up the aquifers. As a youth and as human, I must think of my future, and what I'm leaving my children.' Other communities held similar protests following the actions taken in the Ixil region. On June 26, a similar action was held in Santa Cruz del Quiche, the department's largest city. Once again protesters were demanding that authorities stop issuing licenses for the exploitation of forests. Increase in Logging across Guatemala 
Guatemala is home to vast forests and jungles, but these regions have increasingly come under threat to deforestation. Critics blame uneducated campesinos clearing land for agriculture as one of the prime culprits. This does represent a threat, but there are other bigger threats, including lumber companies, and organized crime. The protest over logging industry activity in indigenous regions occurs at a time in Guatemala of increased concern over deforestation, and comes after the historic march for water in April 2016. Community representatives, nongovernmental organizations, and activists see a connection between forests and water. The Guatemalan government, too, maintains a campaign of reforestation, but this has not stopped companies from cutting down forests for the valuable woods, or the razing of forests by narco-traffickers in the northern department of Pet√©n to build landing strips. 
The Guatemalan Ministry of the Economy actively promotes the investment of companies interested in exploiting the country's nearly 2 million acres of forests. Logging companies and lumber traders have taken an interest in the vast forests of the highlands of Guatemala, where they can find rare hard and soft woods, such as teak, mahogany, oak and the more common pine. These resources can fetch hefty prices at market. 
The exportation of lumber and products produced from wood from Guatemala has increased significantly. From 2013 to 2014, lumber exports increased 8 percent, from $6.7 million dollars to $8.6 million. This continues the long trend of the increase in the exportation of lumber and wood products, such as furniture. 
But this increase in export of lumber brings the companies into conflict with indigenous communities. According to research by Guatemalan environmentalist and researcher, Juan Skinner, the indigenous regions of the country on average contain more forest cover than the non-indigenous regions of the country. 
A 2005 report that Skinner authored highlights that municipalities that are less than 25 percent indigenous have forest cover of around 12 percent. Whereas regions where the population is more than 75 percent indigenous have forest cover of around 35 percent. Guatemala's Mayan communities are not alone in their concern with the destruction of forests. The southern Xinca community of Quesada, Jutiapa has long taken steps to protect the forests that make up their communal territory. The Xinca people are one of the many ethnicities that make up Guatemala. The rural community in the southern department of Jutiapa has held their forest as communal lands since the 1850s, with subsequent generations continuing to protect the mountain and the forests. Today the forests represent 80 percent of the more than 13,500 acres of land, with the remainder utilized for crops, such as coffee and maize. 'Our ancestors left us the land and a group to protect our mountain,' said Jak Mardogueo Ogorio, a representative of the communities' Directive Council. 'All this was passed down through the generations, and we continue this today. In order to cut a tree down, you first must receive permission from the council.' The community leaders have also barred any large-scale logging operations. 'We don't permit companies to operate in our forests,' Ogorio said. 'In past epochs companies tried to negotiate for access to the forests, but they always wanted more. How many years for a new tree to grow? Up on the mountain there are trees that you cannot encircle with three people. This is what we are protecting.' 
Ogorio and the other 13 members of the community council work directly with the residents to build awareness of the importance of the forests through regular meetings, trainings and a campaign to build alternative cooking stoves that utilize less firewood. In August and September 2016, the council implemented the insulation of 400 cooking stoves in conjuncture with Utz Che, a Guatemalan non-governmental organization. 
'This project allows us to slow deforestation because the stoves use less firewood, and there is no need for more and more wood,' Ogorio said. 'These stoves allow us to protect our forests.' 
Community leaders of Quesada maintain vigilance over the threat of forest fires on communal lands for which they receive funding from INAB. This has generated work opportunity in a region where there are not many options. 
The community of La Bendici√≥n in the southern department of Esquitla is one of the few regions on Guatemala's southern coast not dominated by sugar and African oil palm plantations. Residents of the small community were displaced by the country's 36-year-long internal armed conflict. At the end of the war they negotiated the purchase of a 5,500-acre coffee farm through the Land Fund in 2000 for about $1 million, far more than the value of the land. 
When the families already burdened by debt arrived in 2001, they were shocked to learn that the land was not in the state that the Land Fund had promised. There were no rivers, as they were promised there would be, and the high winds meant that their crops were damaged, and there was no paved road. But there was a forest that contained an aquifer. Disappointed residents quickly left the community, leaving just 53 families of the original 170. 
Residents continued to be burdened by debt, despite the rich forests. In 2002, the Land Fund proposed a solution: sell the forest. 'The same Land Fund that assisted us in purchasing our land was pressuring us to sell the forests in order to resolve the debt,' said Veronica Hernandez, a 47-year-old community leader. 'But we refused because if we would have sold our forests, we would have been left without water, or with contaminated water.' Since refusing to sell the land to logging interest, the community has organized to maintain the forests, and protect them from illegal logging and from forest fires. The residents also hold regular community-wide meetings to work to train everyone on the importance of the forests, and to guarantee that no one goes up into the mountain to cut down the precious trees. 
Residents have also worked to develop projects like those being implemented in Quesada in order to decrease their impact on the forests. These stoves and solar projects are received across the community to great success. The residents' resolve to protect their forest was further strengthened following the April 2016 water march, when thousands of campesinos marched to demand the protection of Guatemala's water sources. 
'The April march was important for us and other communities along Guatemala's coast,' Hernandez said. 'It has strengthened our drive to protect the forests and the mangroves along the coast.' 
Despite the fact that the community was able to hold off the lumber interests following the purchase of the land, Hernandez and the other residents maintain vigilance to guarantee that no company comes to exploit their land and forests. 'These companies always come into our communities to rob from us,' Hernandez said. 'They then leave us with all the costs.' 
Back in Nebaj, the Indigenous Authority is working to replicate the awareness in La Benedici√≥n and Quesada over the importance of forests. 
'We are trying to inform community members of the impacts of deforestation,' Terraza said. This sharing of information is strengthened through the local Ixil University, which works to build awareness, and bring higher education to the region. 
'But we have to do more,' Terraza added. 'We must struggle to guarantee that people know what the impacts are.' 
The Indigenous Authorities of Nebaj stated that they are considering other actions, including the continuation of pressure on the state bodies, including INAB, the continuation of protests, and the direct action of blocking trucks transporting lumber. 
'[INAB] is an institution of the state,' Terraza said. 'If we have all these trees, then it is because we have protected the forests for some time; our ancestors also protected these forests. It should not be so easy for them to arrive and issue licenses to companies to exploit the forests.'

Nuclear weapons In fact, Russia is not about to go to war with America. Much of its language is no more than bluster. But it does pose a threat to stability and order. And the first step to answering that threat is to understand that Russian belligerence is not a sign of resurgence, but of a chronic, debilitating weakness. Vlad the invader As our special report this week sets out, Russia confronts grave problems in its economy, politics and society. Its population is ageing and is expected to shrink by 10% by 2050. An attempt to use the windfall from the commodity boom to modernise the state and its economy fell flat. Instead Mr Putin has presided over a huge increase in government: between 2005 and 2015, the share of Russian GDP that comes from public spending and state-controlled firms rose from 35% to 70%. Having grown by 7% a year at the start of Mr Putin's reign, the economy is now shrinking. Sanctions are partly to blame, but corruption and a fall in the price of oil matter more. The Kremlin decides who gets rich and stays that way. Vladimir Yevtushenkov, a Russian tycoon, was detained for three months in 2014. When he emerged, he had surrendered his oil company. Mr Putin has sought to offset vulnerability at home with aggression abroad. With their mass protests after election-rigging in 2011-12, Russia's sophisticated urban middle classes showed that they yearn for a modern state. When the oil price was high, Mr Putin could resist them by buying support. Now he shores up his power by waging foreign wars and using his propaganda tools to whip up nationalism. He is wary of giving any ground to Western ideas because Russia's political system, though adept at repression, is brittle. Institutions that would underpin a prosperous Russia, such as the rule of law, free media, democracy and open competition, pose an existential threat to Mr Putin's rotten state. For much of his time in office Mr Obama has assumed that, because Russia is a declining power, he need not pay it much heed. Yet a weak, insecure, unpredictable country with nuclear weapons is dangerous'îmore so, in some ways, even than the Soviet Union was. Unlike Soviet leaders after Stalin, Mr Putin rules alone, unchecked by a Politburo or by having witnessed the second world war's devastation. He could remain in charge for years to come. Age is unlikely to mellow him. Mr Obama increasingly says the right things about Putinism'îhe sounded reasonably tough during a press conference this week'îbut Mr Putin has learned that he can defy America and come out on top. Mild Western sanctions make ordinary Russians worse off, but they also give the people an enemy to unite against, and Mr Putin something to blame for the economic damage caused by his own policies. Ivan the bearable What should the West do? Time is on its side. A declining power needs containing until it is eventually overrun by its own contradictions'îeven as the urge to lash out remains. Because the danger is of miscalculation and unchecked escalation, America must continue to engage in direct talks with Mr Putin even, as today, when the experience is dispiriting. Success is not measured by breakthroughs and ceasefires'îwelcome as those would be in a country as benighted as Syria'îbut by lowering the chances of a Russian blunder. Nuclear miscalculation would be the worst kind of all. Hence the talks need to include nuclear-arms control as well as improved military-to-military relations, in the hope that nuclear weapons can be kept separate from other issues, as they were in Soviet times. That will be hard because, as Russia declines, it will see its nuclear arsenal as an enduring advantage. Another area of dispute will be Russia's near abroad. Ukraine shows how Mr Putin seeks to destabilise countries as a way to stop them drifting out of Russia's orbit (see article ). America's next president must declare that, contrary to what Mr Trump has said, if Russia uses such tactics against a NATO member, such as Latvia or Estonia, the alliance will treat it as an attack on them all. Separately the West needs to make it clear that, if Russia engages in large-scale aggression against non-NATO allies, such as Georgia and Ukraine, it reserves the right to arm them. Above all the West needs to keep its head. Russian interference in America's presidential election merits measured retaliation. But the West can withstand such 'active measures'. Russia does not pretend to offer the world an attractive ideology or vision. Instead its propaganda aims to discredit and erode universal liberal values by nurturing the idea that the West is just as corrupt as Russia, and that its political system is just as rigged. It wants to create a divided West that has lost faith in its ability to shape the world. In response, the West should be united and firm.

A recent cover and main article in the Economist , pictured above, reminds me of just how hyperbolic and ideological is the West's propaganda against Russian President Vladimir Putin. While maybe good polemical fodder as a cartoon on the editorial page, the fact that this demonic caricature merits front cover status, indicates just how programmed and institutionalized Western mainstream media is. Westerners love to insult the Anti-West press for being 'party organs' and 'government mouthpieces'. But, why travel so far? They only need to stay home with their national New York Times, Radio France and BBC , to really appreciate Bernaysian psyops being passed off as serious journalism (as in Edward Bernays). I don't call it living behind the Great Western Firewall for nothing. 
I have a friend whose email signature is 'Blame it on Putin'. For a while, he changed it to 'Blame it on China'. But that didn't last long and he recently changed it back. As we have seen with the most depressing predictability, President Putin, specifically, and Russia in general are the voodoo pin dolls of Western racism and demonization of another people (Slavs) and other religions (Orthodox Christianity, as well as widespread Islam and Buddhism in Siberia). http://chinarising.puntopress.com/2015/10/01/slavs-and-the-yellow-peril-are-niggers-brutes-and-beasts-in-the-eyes-of-western-empire-the-saker-44-days-radio-sinoland-2015-10-1/ 
What is so remarkable is how unhinged and psychopathic the West's racist propaganda is against Putin & Co., compared to the attacks on China's President Xi Jinping (XJP) and the Chinese people. It transgresses irrational fear, to the point of being sick, black humor. Yet, about the most polemical front cover against XJP was Time magazine in April, 2016, seen below. Making China's leader look like a Mao Zedong- Blade Runner replicant is tame and almost quaint, compared to the Orwellian 'Emmanuel Goldstein' tsunami being launched nonstop against Putin. 

Pretty tame stuff, this, compared to the racist feeding frenzy that Western propaganda is ginning up against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Slavic countrymen. 
True, Russia has the longest border with what in now considered 'Europe', and there is tremendous historical Western precedence to keep Germany from forming any kind of economic or geopolitical alliance with Russia. As well, the West's Ukrainian color revolution turned out to be a total genocidal failure, with Russia reintegrating Crimea and Donbass biding its time for a hopeful remarriage in the years to come. Needless to say, the revenge factor, and if there is anything that Western tyranny loves more, it's to avenge its long list of failed chaos and extermination around the world. 
But, Russia is officially a capitalist country. Its current constitution was largely written by American fifth columnists. The Russian Central Bank is widely presumed to be under the thumb of the West's oil banking families. In spite of widespread ignorance around the world, on these two counts, China can definitely list itself in the opposing column. http://chinarising.puntopress.com/2016/10/18/so-called-communist-china-an-exclusive-article-for-the-all-china-review-16-10-17/ . Given America's post-1917, deranged, hysterical fear of, and untold billions spent to crush any communist expression at home and around the world, you would think that red China and Xi would be Public Enemy Number One. But no, it's Putin and the Russians. 
One factor might be Western perceptions of Russia's and China's military strength. Russians have shown off their powerful, well-run army, navy and air force in Syria and the Black Sea. The West is probably in a bit of an historic rut, when looking at China's rapidly modernizing People's Liberation Army (PLA), like back to the Korean War, when the just liberated New China had no air force, no navy and no nuclear missiles, yet still kicked the pants off Uncle Sam, using mostly World War I vintage arms. But then again, nobody in the West will ever admit that they lost the Korean War in the first place. http://chinarising.puntopress.com/2016/09/04/from-may-9th-in-moscow-to-september-3rd-in-beijing-the-anti-west-order-comes-full-circle-reprint/ . I can tell you that here in China, just like 1950-1953, XJP and the PLA do not fear American military power, not one iota. Respect it, yes. Fear it, never. President Xi has put the PLA on combat ready war footing and he means it. http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/966932.shtml 
But there is a new gadfly in America's imperial ointment, one who may push President Xi and the Chinese people up the racist hate-o-meter, to Slavic levels, and that menace is the Philippines' new president, Rodrigo Duterte. http://chinarising.puntopress.com/2016/09/17/puppet-japan-saves-uncle-sams-face-in-south-china-sea-after-philippines-principled-stand-vs-imperialism-jeff-j-brown-on-press-tv/ . This plainspoken, no bullshit world leader is Uncle Sam's worst nightmare. He is calling American empire what it is: genocidal, dictatorial and rapacious. Not once, but day after day, meeting after meeting, press conference after press conference. 
At September 8-9, 2016's ASEAN summit in Laos, Duterte showed a colonial era photo and talked about the genocide that the US committed, as it brutally conquered the Philippines, 1899-1913, killing an estimated 1.25 million people, about 25% of the nation's population. Western media censored it like the plague (they have been anyway, for over a century) and even semi-friendly outlets like the South China Morning Post were aghast that he actually associated the West with genocide. Heaven forbid! This, in spite of the fact the easily 80-90% of history's genocides and exterminations were and are being perpetrated by Eurangloland, including of course Israel. Behind the Great Western Firewall, genocide is exclusively reserved for powerless, dark skinned people and unrepentant socialists, like Serbia's framed and destroyed Slobodan Milosevic. President Rodrigo Duterte shows images of the Bud Dajo massacre during his speech at the 2016 Metrobank Foundation's Outstanding Filipinos awarding ceremony in Malaca√±an's Rizal Hall on September 12.

Speaking truth to imperial power, Duterte gives a blunt lesson on Western genocide, during the recent ASEAN summit in Laos. How dare you tell it like it is! (Image by Baidu.com) 
Duterte is a semi-official socialist-populist. His cabinet is inclusive and consultative, with former imprisoned and exiled political opposition leaders, including communists and Muslims. He clearly can't stand America's grotesque, imperial arrogance and tyranny, in a country that has been a pliant doormat for US mayhem and exploitation in Asia, going back to the turn of the 19 th -20 th century. When Duterte's hometown of Davao was hit with a very suspicious, false flag smelling public market bombing, on September 2, 2016, he suggested that the automatic-to-blame Abu Sayyef Group, a Muslim independence outfit on his island of Mindanao, is controlled by US Special Forces based there, which is of course true. But, world leaders aren't supposed to speak truth to power, especially 'little brown brothers', as Filipino Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay has described America's attitude to his long suffering and abused nation. http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/09/17/1624575/dfa-chief-philippines-no-little-brown-brother-us 
After signing with XJP more than three times as many development deals ($15 billion), as the US has totally invested to date in the Philippines ($4.7 billion), Duterte declared to the world that the 'US has lost' and that his country was realigning with Baba Beijing. His official government/trade delegation had an unprecedented 300 members and another 150 business people paid their own way to join the Asian lovefest. The two sides set up bilateral committees to discuss and negotiate their South China Sea claims, which is anathema to Uncle Sam, who always insists on being the rabid Rottweiler in the middle. Next stop was US prostitute Japan, where he further declared that the Philippines would be free of all foreign military (meaning US marines and special forces), something that has not happened since 1521, when Spain began colonizing and raping the archipelago. 
This is all very powerful, history changing geopolitics. Almost every other world leader who has talked and acted like this, has either been overthrown and/or murdered by the West, sooner than later. Clearly, from the perspective of the West, Duterte's visionary, regional reset is closely tied to President Xi and China. It is for this reason that XJP may be getting the Slavic-Putin treatment on an accelerated schedule, in a desperate attempt to trash China's deep, historical leadership and trust role in Asia. 
The old story about people being able to see that the emperor is not wearing any clothes, is very apropos to Duterte. He is shouting out to the world that Western empire is a colossal failure and humiliation for his impoverished, exploited citizens, and by extension, equally so for every other member of humanity outside Eurangloland. http://chinarising.puntopress.com/2016/07/16/communist-china-vs-capitalist-philippines-vs-imperial-france-china-rising-radio-sinoland-160716/ . Once one person pierces the veil, it emboldens others to finally have the courage to pile on. 
For Uncle Sam, it's already happening. Malaysian Prime Minster Najib Razak is visiting XJP and Co. in Beijing, October 31-November 6, 2016, an unusually long state visit by a world leader. Najib has declared that Malaysia is committed to strengthening friendship with China and pushing ties to 'new highs'. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-china-idUSKCN12R0ZU . As more and more countries embrace China's history founding One Belt One Road plan, in which the whole world is and will benefit into the 22 nd century, including Eurangloland, expect ever more desperate, racist demonization and dehumanization of Xi Jinping and the Chinese people, along the lines of Putin and the Russians. Maybe the CIA-MI6 can dig up that old 19 th century chestnut, 'The Yellow Peril', and give it a modern day makeover. Stay tuned to the New York Times, Radio France and the BBC , as the propaganda psyops campaign takes shape. 
As more and more world leaders are emboldened to speak out against Western tyranny, thanks to Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte's courage to make a public stand, President Xi Jinping can expect his face to morph into Putin's, who is diabolically pictured above on a January, 2014 Newsweek cover.

Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN A previous article explained the so-called battle for Mosul is a hoax. It's about shifting thousands of US-supported ISIS fighters to Syria, along with perhaps letting Turkish forces move in to control evacuated areas. In Moscow, Russian and Syrian foreign ministers expressed concern. Sergey Lavrov said Moscow will 'take measures to prevent terrorists moving from Mosul to Syria with their heavy arms, which, of course, will seriously worsen the situation in the Syrian republic.' .. 'We think that it is important not to let this happen'¶We cannot let the terrorist leave Mosul (for) Syria with the aim to re-direct their activity.' .. Syrian Foreign Walid al-Muallem said the US-led 'coalition has never fought Daesh. On the contrary, it is destroying the infrastructure of the Syrian economy, and recently destroyed a huge number of bridges on the Euphrates River'¶They want to move Daesh from Mosul into Raqqa.' .. Assad close political and media advisor Bouthaina Shaaban explained Washington's dirty scheme, ignored by media scoundrels, saying redeploying ISIS fighters from Mosul to Syria would represent a 'huge danger to our sovereignty, to our country.' .. 'Russia and Syria are looking at this issue extremely seriously. We're not going to sit and watch'¶The way they encircle Mosul shows they would like these terrorists to move into to Syria'¶They're navigating terrorism from one place to another, limiting terrorism in one place, directing it to another place. That's the absolute truth of what is happening in our region.' .. Washington and its rogue allies pay lip service alone to fighting terrorism while actively supporting it. So-called 'moderates' aren't so 'moderate,' Shaaban explained. 'There are no 'Syrian moderates.' ' .. They're cold-blooded cutthroat killers, imperial death squads, serving US imperial interests, actively supported by its coalition partners wanting Assad toppled, Syrian sovereignty destroyed, an Israeli rival eliminated, and Iran isolated ahead of repeating the same scenario against its government. .. Aided by Russia, Iran and Hezbollah fighters, Syria is engaged in the 'most challenging issue for humanity in the 21st century,' Shaaban stressed 'ì the struggle to defeat the scourge of US created and supported terrorism, threatening everyone everywhere unless challenged and eliminated. .. America intends stopping at nothing to advance its imperium 'ì its goal, unchallenged dominion over planet earth, its resources and populations 'ì a world unfit and unsafe to live in. Beginning with the Bill and Hillary Clinton co-presidency's Balkan wars, culminating with the 1999 rape of Yugoslavia, all sovereign independent states have been targeted for regime change 'ì the 9/11 false flag used as pretext to wage phony war on terrorism. .. 
Syria is in the eye of the storm. Conflicts continue raging in all countries America attacked after that staged incident 'ì effectively declaring war on humanity. Will nuclear war on Russia, China and Iran follow Hillary's likely ascension to power next year? Her rage for wanting their sovereign governments eliminated risks ending life on earth.

Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN H aving closed his earlier investigation into Hillary's use of her private email server for classified State Department documents without bringing charges, dismissing indictable evidence, it's hard imagining a shift of agency policy now. So what's going on? Is FBI Director Comey trying to save face, even at this late stage, having tarnished the reputation of the agency and himself. The fullness of time will show what he has in mind. He faces intense political pressure from key Democrat senators, demanding immediate answers about why he's reopening his investigation days before November's election, an unprecedented act. .. Senators Patrick Leahy, Dianne Feinstein, Thomas Carper and Ben Cardin wrote Comey , saying: .. '(N)o later than Monday, 31 October 2016, we request you provide us with more detailed information about the investigative steps being taken, the number of emails involved, and what is being done to determine how many of the emails are duplicative of those already reviewed by the FBI.' They want Attorney General Loretta Lynch explaining her involvement in Comey's action, if any. The Hillary campaign called for 'public answers' to clarify what new information the FBI discovered. .. After saying that revisiting his decision last July would be unlikely, Comey opted for an October surprise 'ì the likes of which Washington hasn't seen since the tumultuous end of Nixon's tenure. Paul Craig Roberts said he's gotten word ' that the FBI has reopened the Hillary case of her violation of US National Security protocols, not because of the content of the new email releases, but because voter support for Trump seems to be overwhelming, while Hillary has cancelled appearances due to inability to muster a crowd. The popular vote leaves the FBI far out on the limb for its corrupt clearance of Hillary. The agency now has to redeem itself.' .. How remains to be seen. Like Roberts, I'm puzzled. Washington power brokers chose Hillary to succeed Obama. Enormous resources, energy, corporate pollsters consistently showing her ahead, and one-sided scoundrel media support have gone into assuring it. .. Have things changed days before November 8? Are power brokers abandoning Hillary this late in the game? The last 48 hours have been breathtaking 'ì the stuff Hollywood thrillers are made of. Will Hillary supporters blame Russia for Comey's action? One Democrat congressman suggested it. Will Comey be accused of being a Kremlin agent? .. However things unfold in the campaign's final days, Trump got a significant boost 'ì whether enough for a 'master of suspense' Alfred Hitchcock ending remains to be seen. My view, right or wrong, remains the same. After going all-out for Hillary throughout months of campaigning, it's hard believing power brokers decided otherwise this late in the game 'ì unheard of in US electoral politics. .. At the same time, this political season has been unlike any I remember since the 1940s. Nothing ahead will surprise me.

By Bel√©n Fern√°ndez | FAIR PHOTO ABOVE: Hillary Clinton told Goldman Sachs that a no-fly zone is 'going to kill a lot of Syrians.' (cc photo: Gage Skidmore) A s she marches toward the US presidency, Hillary Clinton has stepped up her promotion of the idea that a no-fly zone in Syria could 'save lives' and 'hasten the end of the conflict' that has devastated that country since 2011. It has now been revealed, of course, that Clinton hasn't always expressed the same optimism about the no-fly zone in private. The Intercept (10/10/16 ) reported on Clinton's recently leaked remarks in a closed-door speech to Goldman Sachs in 2013: To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we're not putting our pilots at risk'îyou're going to kill a lot of Syrians. Other relevant characters, such as US Joint Chiefs of Staff chair Joseph Dunford ( Daily Caller , 9/26/16 ), have warned that a no-fly zone in Syria would simply intensify the conflict'îwhich presumably isn't the best way to hasten its end. L uckily for those who prefer to rally around illogic, however, plenty of media have already rolled out the welcome mat for peddlers of the 'humanitarian' vision of increased Western military interference in Syria. The New York Times ' Nicholas Kristof ( 10/6/16 ) argues against 'Obama's paralysis' and for 'more robust strategies advocated by Hillary Clinton.' The New York Times ' self-appointed savior of women , Nicholas Kristof ( 10/6/16 ), invoked the plight of a young Syrian girl in Aleppo to conclude that Obama's alleged 'paralysis' on Syria 'has been linked to the loss of perhaps half a million lives' in the country, as well as to 'the rise of extremist groups like the Islamic State,' among other unpleasant outcomes. We have no 'excuse,' we're told, for 'failing to respond to mass atrocities.' Never mind that the rise of ISIS has much to do with that mass atrocity known as the US invasion of Iraq, thanks to which many young Iraqi girls and other human beings have suffered rape, mutilation and death. It's convenient for certain industries, at least, when US weapons are deemed the solution for problems US weapons helped to create in the first place. Furthermore, plenty of US weapons continue to flow to countries known for arming and funding ISIS and similar outfits'îan arrangement unlikely to be rectified by a no-fly zone targeting the Syrian government and the Russians. USA Today ( 10/8/16 ), meanwhile, ran an opinion piece by an American doctor who worked briefly at a now-destroyed hospital in Aleppo, arguing that the US 'should lead the way in establishing real no-fly zones, either under United Nations auspices or with the British and the French''îbecause 'otherwise, our inaction will continue to be an embarrassment and stand as an example of our spineless irresponsibility.' But considering that there has already been plenty of US action in Syria'îincluding the mistaken 'pulverization' of whole families with children'îit would seem we've already exhibited a fair amount of lethal irresponsibility. Beyond the opinion pages, media figures are pushing the 'humanitarian' approach with varying degrees of subtlety. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd ( 10/16/16 ) recently pressed Vice President Joe Biden on the lack of a no-fly zone over Aleppo, suggesting that the Obama administration will 'look back and wonder what if? What if? What if? What if?' Of course, no campaign for saving lives with bombs would be complete without everyone's favorite examples of feel-good destruction from the former Yugoslavia. The Washington Post ( 9/9/16 ) hosted an opinion by Bosnia and Herzegovina's first ambassador to the UN, Muhamed Sacirbey, straightforwardly headlined: 'Western Military Intervention Saved Lives in Bosnia. It Can Work in Syria, Too.' Sacirbey warns that 'Syria's largest city is on the brink of starvation. Bombed from the skies and besieged on the ground, Aleppo's 2 million residents may soon be exterminated.' Gone, apparently, are the days of factchecking, when someone at the Post might have alerted the author to the reality that the vast majority of Aleppo's residents live in government-controlled areas and are thus not under attack by said government. Comparing Aleppo to besieged Sarajevo, Sacirbey determines that Sarajevans ultimately 'escaped many of the horrors now awaiting Aleppo's residents'¶ because NATO opted (albeit belatedly and, too often, inadequately) to uphold its responsibility to protect Bosnian civilians.' After lauding Bosnia's no-fly zone, Sacirbey pulls this prediction out of a hat: 'Limited   Syria would save civilian lives, perhaps as many as 200 a week.' In their indispensable essay for Monthly Review ( 10/07 ), 'The Dismantling of Yugoslavia: A Study in In humanitarian Intervention (and a Western Liberal-Left Intellectual and Moral Collapse),' Edward S. Herman and David Peterson make it unavoidably clear that the West's business in Bosnia   saving lives'îand much to do with the contrary. The Bill Clinton administration, they note, actively sabotaged agreements to end the war at an earlier date, while 'helping arm the Bosnian Muslims and Croatians and helping bring thousands of Mujahedin to fight in Bosnia.' America's support in this case for jihadists'îa secret alliance also discussed by scholar Tariq Ali ( Guardian , 9/9/06 )'îfurther complicates the assumption that the US is somehow capable of fixing the current jihad problem. In predictable fashion, US media led the charge to the Bosnian intervention ( Extra! , 10-11/92 ), dutifully painting the Serbs as demonic aggressors, parroting inflated Bosnian casualty estimates and otherwise behaving as the official PR arm of the establishment. A similar performance was repeated shortly thereafter with Kosovo, where minimal regard was given to actual facts on the ground and the specter of Serbian-waged genocide was instead hysterically invoked. Noam Chomsky ( Monthly Review , 9/08 ) cited various reports, including from the British government, that the US-backed Kosovo Liberation Army was actually responsible for more killings than the Serbs in the run-up to NATO's bombing campaign'îa project that naturally also managed to kill several thousand people. While Yugoslavia has now been fully dismantled, the myth of Western humanitarian intervention there has emerged unscathed; in his recent dispatch on Syria, Kristof brought up Kosovo as an example of how 'the military toolbox has saved lives.' To be sure, 'saving lives' is a much nobler goal than, say, endowing NATO with a new lease on life or clearing the way for total neoliberal assault 'îtwo outcomes of the West's Yugoslav ventures. Hence the utility, as Herman and Peterson write, of the 'edifice of lies that serves and protects the Western interventions in the former Yugoslavia'îand which laid the ideological foundations for the US role in Iraq and for future so-called humanitarian interventions.' In Syria's brutal war, meanwhile, humanitarian motives will presumably be utilized as a veneer for pursuing more fundamental goals, like neutralizing resistance to US/Israeli regional designs and promoting that profitable sort of chaos that produces massive arms sales. And just as those in the West who failed to leap onto the bandwagon in Yugoslavia were denounced as ' apologists for genocide ' and the like, opponents of increased Western military action in Syria will be increasingly assailed as pro-Assad fanatics with Syrian blood on their hands. One strong candidate for fanatic-hood is Greg Shupak, who in a recent Jacobin magazine dispatch ( 10/20/16 ) dared to argue that a no-fly zone 'would actually represent an escalation of war that is guaranteed to harm civilians in the name of protecting them.' Emphasizing that opposition to said zone is not meant in any way 'to minimize or rationalize the torture, mass killings or severe sieges enacted by the Syrian state and its allies,' Shupak continues: 'The imminent question, however, is not, 'Is the Syrian government good?'; it's 'Should America drop more bombs on Syria?'' Because, at the end of the day, humanitarian war just isn't humanly possible.

Originally appeared at Strategic Culture Foundation T he Obama administration is now accusing Russia of cyber-crime and trying to disrupt the US presidential election. The claim is so far-fetched, it is hardly credible. More credible is that the US is reeling from Putin's stunning humiliation earlier this week. Since June, US media and supporters of Democrat presidential contender Hillary Clinton have been blaming Russian state-sponsored hackers for breaking into the Democratic party's database. It is further alleged that Moscow is stealthily trying to influence the outcome of the election, by releasing damaging information on Clinton, which might favor Republican candidate Donald Trump. Russia has vehemently denied any connection to the cyber-crime charges, or trying to disrupt the November poll. Now the Obama administration has stepped into the fray by openly accusing Russia. ¬´US government officially accuses Russia of hacking campaign to interfere with elections¬ª, reported the Washington Post. This takes the row to a whole new level. No longer are the insinuations a matter of private, partisan opinion. The US government is officially labelling the Russian state for cyber-crime and political subversion. Predictably, following the latest allegations, there are calls among American lawmakers for ramping up more economic sanctions against Russia. While US intelligence figures are urging for retaliatory cyber-attacks on Russian government facilities. Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov derided the US claims as ¬´rubbish¬ª. He noted that the Kremlin's computer system incurs hundreds of hacking attempts every day, many of which can be traced to American origin, but Moscow doesn't turn around and blame the US government for such cyber-attacks. There are several signs that the latest brouhaha out of Washington is a bogus diversion. A s with previous Russian-hacker claims by the Democrats and US media, there is no evidence presented by the Obama administration to support its grave allegations against the Russian government. Assertion without facts does not meet a minimal standard of proof. When reports emerged in June 'ì again through the Washington Post 'ì that the Democrat National Committee (DNC) was hacked by Russian agents, the allegation relied on investigations by a private cyber security firm by the name of CrowdStrike. The firm is linked by personnel to the NATO-affiliated, anti-Russian think tank Atlantic Council. Again no verifiable evidence was presented then, just the word of a dubious partisan source. Scoundrels like John Podesta, a filthy DNC apparatchik, are naturally throwing more fuel on the flames. Back then the Russian scare story, for that's what it was, served as a useful diversion from far more important issues. Such as the 19,000 emails released from the DNC database showing that the party chiefs had preordained Clinton's presidential nomination over her Democrat rival Bernie Sanders. Much-vaunted ¬´US democracy¬ª was exposed as a fraud, and so the Washington establishment quickly went into damage-limitation mode by smearing Russia. It was the whistleblower site Wikileaks, run by Australian journalist Julian Assange, that released the embarrassing emails. It   Russia. Assange has since hinted that his source was within the Democrat party itself. This is where it gets really explosive. Assange has vowed to release more emails that will prove that Clinton as Secretary of State back in 2011-2012 masterminded the supply of weapons and money to Islamist terror networks in Libya and Syria for the objective of regime change. Furthermore, Assange says that the emails prove that Clinton lied under oath to Congress when she denied in 2013 that she was had any involvement in facilitating arms to the jihadists. Assange has said that Wikileaks is going to publish the incriminating emails on Clinton's alleged gun-running to terrorists this month. If the evidence stands up, Clinton could be prosecuted for perjury as well as treason in aiding and abetting official terrorist enemies of the US. The exposure of an American presidential candidate as being involved in state sponsorship of terrorism while serving as a top government official is a powerful incentive for the Obama administration to find a lurid diversion. Hence, the latest charges by the US government against Russia as perpetrating cyber-crime and of trying to subvert American democracy. This is just one more illustration of how irrational and unhinged the US government has become. Day by day, it seems, leads to more damning revelations of Washington's complicity in illegal wars, covert subversion of foreign states, and systematic collusion with terrorist networks which have inflicted thousands of deaths on American citizens, among many more thousands of other innocent civilians around the world. In addition to exposure by sources like Wikileaks, much of revelation about US criminality and state-sponsored banditry has emerged from Russia's principled   Syria. Russia's intervention has not only helped salvage the Syrian nation from a foreign conspiracy of covert war for regime change. Russia's intervention has also brought into clear focus the systematic links between Washington and its terrorist proxy army working on its behalf in Syria. Washington's mask of moral and legal superiority has been ripped from its face. And what the world is seeing is the vile ugliness beneath. Such is Washington's ignominious fall from pretend-grace to its grim, odious reality that Vladimir Putin this week was empowered to speak from the moral high ground. In announcing Russia's unilateral suspension of a 2002 accord with the US for the disposal of nuclear-weapon-grade plutonium, Putin went much, much further. He gave Washington a list of ultimatums that included the US ending its trumped-up sanctions against Russia, with financial compensation, as well as the scaling back of NATO forces from Russia's border. In other words, the Russian leader was talking truth to American power in a way that megalomaniac Washington, with all its ridiculous delusions of ¬´exceptionalism¬ª, has never ever heard before. American pretensions of greatness are eroding like a castle built on sand. Washington's criminal enterprises and specifically the complicity in terrorism for the supreme crime of foreign aggression are being glaringly exposed. And now with due contempt, Russia is putting manners on Washington. It must be excruciating the humiliation for the narcissistic American tyrant to be treated with the disrespect that it deserves and which is long overdue. Moreover, the humiliation is not just in the eyes of the world. The American people can see the true ugly nature of their rulers too. When a giant banner declaring ¬´Putin a peacemaker¬ª was unfurled off Manhattan bridge in New York City this weekend, the popular enthusiasm went viral. Washington is reeling from Putin's righteous courage to call it out for what it is. The truth-telling is hard to take for this unipolar unicorn. Its deluded myth-making about its own virtues are being stripped bare. What's going on here is a world-class, historic exposure of American power as a nefarious excrescence on humanity. The reaction is understandable: foaming-at-the-mouth, desperate, hysterical and panicked. Accusing Russia of hacking into the American ¬´democratic process¬ª is a wild attempt to divert from the paramount issues: Washington's exposed descent into a vile morass of its own making; the emperor is a criminal; the people know it; and a genuine world leader like Vladimir Putin has the temerity to lay it on the line to this has-been.

ARTICLE

Photo above by The U.S. Army | CC BY 2.0 H ere is a list of the noteworthy, ongoing results of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq beginning in March 2003. (Recall that invasion was denounced by the UN as illegal, based entirely on lies, and'îgiven the U.S.'s hegemonic position in the world, allowing it to act with impunity'îthe crime's architects have never punished.) 1/ The principal achievement of the war and occupation was the dramatic expansion of the al-Qaeda network that had attacked the U.S. on January 11, 2001. An al-Qaeda franchise was established in Iraq for the first time, playing a key role in the Sunni 'insurrection' against the occupiers and their Shiite allies, then expanding across the border into Syria where it split into the al-Nusra affiliate and its even more savage rival, ISIL. Iraq also served and serves as a training ground for jihadis now operating from Iraq to Libya and beyond. 2/ The invasion and its consequences encouraged the cause of Kurdistan , an imagined state straddling Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. The Kurds are the largest stateless people in the world, victims of British and French colonialists who divided the region between them after World War I. After the Gulf War of 1991, the U.S. established a 'no-fly' zone over northern Iraq to discourage Baghdad from deploying troops in the region. Iraqi Kurdistan had already obtained a degree of autonomy before the invasion but the status became official under the occupation and a referendum for independence is likely to pass soon. This would infuriate Iraq and perhaps provoke Turkey's intervention. As it is, the autonomous region is locked in struggle with Baghdad over territorial claims and control over oil fields. 3/ The invasion destroyed the Iraqi state , causing it to fracture into three: Kurdistan, the Sunni zone in the west, and the Shiite-majority areas around Baghdad. The Baathist regime of Saddam Hussein had been extremely repressive and brutal. But it had maintained order; discouraged religion in politics; protected the Christian and other religious minorities; promoted women's rights; imposed no dress code; enforced a criminal code modeled after the Napoleonic (not the Sharia); licensed rock n' roll radio stations, allowed the brewing of beer and its sale etc. The Shiite-led regime boosted into power by the occupation has reversed much of this. (A bill to ban the production and sale of beer was just passed by Parliament last week.) But the regime's power does not extend into much of Anbar Province, ISIL still governs Mosul, and again, Kurdistan has become autonomous. 4/ Because Shiites are the majority in Iraq (60%), and dominate Iran next door; and because the leaders of Shiite parties have studied in Iran or lived their in exile and are sympathetic to Iran's mullah-led regime; and because the U.S. was forced by peaceful mass protests to allow elections and the emergence of Shiites as the leaders of the country, Iran's power and influence in the region has expanded dramatically. (Apparently no one in the State Department thought about that.) Since Iran has not attacked another country in centuries'îbut was savagely attacked by Saddam Hussein in 1981, sparking a long war killing over half a million people'îand since Iran's friendliness to its neighbor, one of the few Arab countries in which its co-coreligionists hold power, is entirely natural, one can ask why anyone might be alarmed by this. But it does alarm some, the leaders of Saudi Arabia, that crucial U.S. Arab ally governed by Wahhabi Sunnis, most of all. 5/ The invasion produced a regional power struggle between Sunni Islamists on the one hand, and their Shiite (and other) enemies on the other. This is often portrayed as a contest between Saudi Arabia (whose government-backed clerics condemn Shiites as heretics, and who fear the prospects for rebellion in Saudi Arabia's own oppressed Shiite minority) and Iran, depicted as the protector of Shiites in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen etc. (The so-called 'Shiite Crescent' extending from Iran to Hizbollah-controlled areas of Lebanon in fact embraces states and movements that have little in common with the Islamic Republic of Iran. But they are all targeted by the medieval regime in Riyadh which tars them all with the Iranian brush.) The Saudis were keen advocates for a U.S. strike on Iran (on the false pretext of a nuclear threat); are major supporters of al-Nusra in Syria and have funded ISIL as well, preferring such Islamist forces to the secular if Alawite-led Syrian regime; and are bombing the hell out of Yemen with active U.S. and British assistance under the false pretext that the Shiite Houthi 'rebels' are agents for an expanding Iran. These things would not be happening, had the U.S. not ripped the lid off Pandora's box in Iraq in March 2003. 6/ The invasion has produced friction between the U.S. and its important NATO ally Turkey (which has the second largest military in the alliance). Turkish war planes are bombing Kurdish YPG (People's Protection Units) militia in Syria who constitute the U.S.'s most reliable allies, producing U.S. protests (which the Turks ignore, arguing straight-faced that the YPG are just as terrorist as ISIL). The Turks warned before the invasion of Iraq that it would likely produce regional instability. But Ankara would have allowed the U.S. to attack from Turkish soil if Turkish forces as part of the 'coalition of the willing' could be stationed around Mosul, once part of Turkey'îthe idea being to contain Kurdish nationalism. Fortunately the parliament rejected the deal. But the predicted instability has occurred. The Arab Spring of 2011 in Syria was not directly connected to the Iraq invasion, but gave the U.S. the opportunity to pontificate that 'Assad has lost legitimacy,' demand his immediate resignation, and bankroll the armed opposition including the Kurds. The fact that U.S. efforts to find and recruit Syrian Arab forces as allies'îwho are not in bed with al-Nusra'îto topple Assad have failed so dismally binds the Pentagon ever closer to forces that Turkey wants to wipe out. (The conflict and contradiction are embarrassing to Washington. Oh, by the way, did you notice that the Turkish foreign minister just announced that Turkey would invade Iraq if it 'felt threatened'?) Having declared in 2011 that Bashar al-Assad must go, the U.S. was faced in 2014 with the horrible embarrassment of ISIL (that toxic fruit of its Iraq invasion) winning lightening victories from Raqqa to Fallujah, obliterating the Sykes-Picot line dividing Syria and Iraq. The now-Syria based terrorists were approaching Baghdad. So now the U.S. having withdrawn all troops in Iraq was back in action, bombing to prevent such a disaster. And it started bombing ISIL positions in Syria (although with far less efficacy than the later Russian efforts) in league with a list of largely reluctant allies dragooned into formal membership in what Washington likes to call a 'coalition' to make its unilateral program for the region sound like the will of what they like to call 'the international community' regardless of how many key nations that imagined 'community' includes. 
Michael Moore's all-out campaign in support of Hillary, and his pathetic attacks on Assange (' He's a human Molotov cocktail' ), typify, all too well, and all too sadly, the despicable qualities of American liberals, especially their treachery and obtuseness when the going gets heavy. Moore, a man supposedly astute enough to do documentaries about American stupidity and chicanery, should know better than go around propagandizing for the Queen of Chaos. Nor render any service to the Democrats a party that he should know damn well betrayed the public interest by passing Obamacare instead of single payer which he himself postulated in his documentary SiCKO. The U.S. command that Assad step down was made in the summer of 2011. Turkey's President Erdogan, hitherto a friend and even mentor of the Syrian leader, opportunistically took up the U.S. demand and demanded his resignation. And Ankara itself began to interfere big-time in the neighboring country it once dominated, targeting Kurds more than anyone else. Since the U.S. relies on these allies, how could there not be a sharp conflict here? 7/ The invasion of Iraq and aftermath resulted in four million Iraqi refugees fleeing the country as of 2007. Hundreds of thousands have poured into Europe, alongside people displaced by U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Libya, and by the turmoil in Syria exacerbated by U.S. actions, producing a massive continent-wide crisis. Many Europeans aptly blame the deluge on the U.S., pointing to the U.S.'s paltry record of admitting refugees from the Middle East and complaining of strained national resources to handle the humanitarian catastrophe. (Another embarrassment.) *** This is all what Buddhists call 'karmic retribution' for past acts. Or what the Hebrew prophet Hosea referred to when he said 'Those who sow the wind reap the whirlwind.' Or what the CIA meant when it invented the term 'blowback.' It's all heading towards something, unless decent people stop it. But when I watch people like Michael Moore line up behind the foremost advocate of war in U.S. politics, joining (consciously, philosophical) amoral thugs hell-bent on maintaining and expanding the empire when it's in a stage of precipitous decline, I am not optimistic. Not only will she win, but she will rival Dick Cheney as a cold-blooded latter-day Cold Warrior, cynically exploiting fear and stupidity to try to bring Russia to its knees. Hillary doesn't recognize any of these seven points, which to recapitulate are: '¢ US actions have greatly strengthened al-Qaeda '¢ US actions have encouraged Kurdish nationalism (with unpredictable ramifications) '¢ The US through its vicious illegal actions has destroyed the modern Iraqi state '¢ US actions have solidified ties between Iran and Iraq's majority Shiite community, strengthening a country still targeted for 'regime change' '¢ The invasion of Iraq and the regime change there exacerbated the historical Sunni-Shiite divide, and encouraged Saudi Arabia as the ultra-Islamist protector of the shrines to redouble its efforts to support extremist Sunnis everywhere in the region '¢ The results of the invasion place Turkey and the U.S. at loggerheads over the question of Kurdish nationalist movements in both Iraq and Syria '¢ US interventions in the Middle East and North Africa since 2001 have produced a massive refugee crisis, inflicted mainly on Europe She does not acknowledge that George W. Bush's invasion (that she so passionately endorsed, fully exposing her Valkyrie soul, was criminal and not somebody's well-meaning 'mistake'). She doesn't have any analysis of the Kurdish question. (She is not'îas sometimes alleged by supporters'îa 'policy wonk' but a lazy intellect who doesn't know jack-shit about the real world.) She has never expressed regret for the horrific destruction of Iraq, nor given any attention to the plight of its women, who were (as she surely knows) much better off under Saddam Hussein. (To acknowledge that would be to suggest that sometimes U.S. imperialism favors misogynist Islamists over relatively progressive secularists, for its own pragmatic empire-building purposes. She can't mention that publicly.) She deals with the rise of Iran'îmade inevitable by the U.S. invasion of Iraq'îby doubling down on her crude clueless Iran rhetoric, which rests on the assumption'îrepeatedly debunked by U.S. intelligence agencies'îthat Iran might pose a nuclear weapons threat. She doesn't understand the history of the Sunni-Shiite divide; I believe she rolls her eyes in irritation that these people have these differences so hard to understand, impeding the Exceptional Nation's ability to straighten everything out by bombing, and conquering, and making people die. She doesn't understand anything about the history of the Kurds and their fate in the region. She feels no guilt at all about her orchestration of the ruin of Libya. She sees no reason to link her own actions to the flooding of Europe with refugees fleeing terror. But she will probably be the next president, with fellow shieldmaidens Michele Flournoy (as 'secretary of defense') and Victoria Nuland or Samantha Power (as secretary of state). Never acknowledging what happened yesterday, never able to absorb historical lessons, determined to maintain and expend its global hegemony (just as that becomes absolutely impossible to do, because other nations rise too, and great nations like Spain and Britain actually get humbled over time), the U.S. under Clinton will likely head methodically towards a showdown with Russia. She wants so badly, to show she can do it. She'll do it for women, everywhere, to show how strong a woman can be. And then there will be a sudden strange change in your environment. As you wonder what's going on you'll be painlessly vaporized, on account of Hillary's passion to topple Assad, or forcibly reintegrate the Donbass into Ukraine. The brilliance of the 2003 invasion will be clarified as never before in that bright blast, as Hillary'îa very strong woman'îcackles in the background from her bunker about how she came, saw, and a million died.

ARTICLE

BY EDITORS OF CHRONICLES MAGAZINE While this is an interesting post, we object to the facile use of the term 'Stalin' to signify something unjustifiably tyrannical, invasive and dictatorial. The Stalin period is surely one of the most complex in modern history, as Stalin ruled the Soviet Union under conditions of extreme Western hostility and outright warfare against the young socialist federation for most of his tenure. Yet, there is little doubt that Josef Stalin was'îfor all his flaws, real and mostly invented and augmented'îa firm and colossal enemy of capitalism, a formidable obstacle to the victory of the 'Wall Street way of life' around the globe and that he did succeed in shaping the USSR into a superpower capable of surviving and rendering help to weaker nations shedding brutal Western colonialism. That, and not the 'crimes of Stalin' is the real source for the undying hatred and nonstop shabby malicious slandering we observe to this day against his legacy (the demonization of Putin, a much milder irritant to the Washington elites should give us some insight into the depths of this imposture) both in the corporate media and political class, but unworthy of repetition among people who should know better or who like to think of themselves as leftist. What use is the anti-communist left in a world on the brink of extinction because of a semi-deranged, hegemonic-at-all-costs runaway imperialism?'îP. Greanville Dateline: October 27, 2016 In his latest Sputnik Radio International interview Srdja Trifkovic discusses the Czech Republic government's establishment of an information unit to counter what it says is pro-Russian, anti-Western and anti-NATO propaganda. 'We want to get into every smartphone,' said Milan Chovanec, the Czech interior minister. Audio (unedited verbatim transcript) Klaus: Speaking truth to the annoyance of the NATO-bought political prostitutes running the Czech state these days. ST: It is strangely reminiscent of the old Soviet times, when any criticism of Soviet policies was termed 'anti-Soviet propaganda,' and was ascribed to some mysterious imperialist forces in the West that were out to subvert the Soviet Union and its 'Fraternal Community of Socialist Nations.' It is rather funny that'îmore than a quarter of a century after the end of the Cold War'îwe see the exact replica of the mindset, and a state-financed reaction, on the side of the so-called liberal-democratic, free-market-oriented, 'Western' members of NATO. It is also significant that one of the foremost critics of the Western policies in general, and in Ukraine in particular, is Vaclav Klaus, one of the most respected Czech politicians. My immediate thought is whether they regard Mr. Klaus'îthe elder statesman of the Czech Republic'îas one of the exponents of the Russian propaganda who needs to be monitored and countered. My second thought is that, ultimately, it comes to the quality of information and analysis. If the makers of this new unit, fighting what they regard as Russian disinformation, are up against certain perfectly justified, rational, and well-reasoned criticism of Western policies, and those of NATO in particular, then they have a big problem. In this time and age, of the mainstream media being confronted by the social media, the Internet, they will have a problem, because the unspoken assumption is that the quality of information and analysis they can offer is better than what they regard as the Russian propaganda. As it happens, we have this counter-propaganda all the time, in the pages of the New York Times and the Washington Post , on the BBC, the CNN, and every flickering screen and every printed page all over the Western world. And yet . . . they are not doing a very good job. Ultimately, if we are looking at an informed and rational consumer of information, he or she will be able to make an astute judgment of who is in the right and who is actually a propagandist. Q: Srdja, if they consider this to be so important at this particular moment, why is this unit made up of only twenty people? ST: It could made up of only two people if they are well informed, capable of top-class analysis, and if they have strong arguments which can be used to counter what they regard as Russian disinformation. It boils down to what I mentioned earlier: the quality of information, and the quality of analysis. Q: Is it going to have any influence on anything at all? ST: Ultimately not. Obviously, the same job is being done by much better paid columnists of the Washington Post , the Guardian , Le Monde , the Frankfurter Rundschau 'îthey are all up to the same thing: to discredit arguments against the global empire of the United States and its fellow travelers in Western Europe. If that job is not done much better by people who are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars or euros every year to do it in a systematic and coherent way, I don't see any way for a bunch of twenty Czech bureaucrats to do it. Q: Let's get back to the accusations that some Czech politicians have been throwing at Moscow, that they are forming the networks of pro-Russian groups that can be used to destabilize the country. How grounded are these accusations? ST: It reminds one of McCarthyism in the United States in the early 1950's. If you are a 'deviant' in your mindset, if you dare criticize the official line, if you say things that are outside the permitted parameters of rightspeak, then you must be an agent for a foreign power. It is a paranoid mindset, it is deeply antidemocratic, and it smacks of Stalinism. This is, of course, Stalinism in a postmodern-liberal guise, but it is not qualitatively different from the original model.

One thought on ' Why Hillary won't unleash WWIII ' shorty says: October 30, 2016 at 8:01 pm 
SELECT COMMENTS | OVERHEARD (ORIGINALLY ON RUSSIA INSIDER) From time to time we import comments we regard as lucid or thought-provoking to a particular discussion. This is such a thread. Some opinions we agree with, some we don't. But they all add an edge to this topic. 'îThe Editors 
MMChomek ' 16 hours ago Alright, let's sum this up. 
Hillary can't launch a No fly zone over Syria, because there is already one in place? Well, the point they are trying to make is that they will get rid of the Russian and Syrian air defenses to launch their own 'We can fly-you can't-zone'. With force. Hillary expressed her willingness to do this several times already. 
Yes, General Dunford said 'we would have to go to war with Syria and Russia' You kind of left out the followup, where he says 'That is a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I'm not going to make' not, 'we can't do this' e.g, he's waiting for the order from the commander in chief. 
This was at the very beginning of the article >She is fully supported by virtually the whole US establishment; a bipartisan, neocon/neoliberalcon, regime change/'humanitarian' imperialist axis. 
So WHO is going to stop her? 
and lastly, first finished Sarmat won't be slipped inside a silo at least until late 2018 Hillary most likely gets to oval office next February kind of a non-sequitur to even mention it 
So you basically say 'This is why Hillary won't start WWIII' and then you throw in a bunch of non-arguments and contradictions 
''' 
Mike John Elissen MMChomek ' 8 hours ago `and lastly, first finished Sarmat won't be slipped inside a silo at least until late 2018 Hillary most likely gets to oval office next February kind of a non-sequitur to even mention it` 
followed by `So you basically say 'This is why Hillary won't start WWIII' and then you throw in a bunch of non-arguments and contradictions` Seems to me the only `non-argumentation` is your view on Billary taking control next year and immediately starting WW3. Even for a war-loving US hawk like her, it will take time to start a war with Russia. 
MMChomek Mike John Elissen ' 8 hours ago God, Hillary doesn't even need to be president to lobby for war. She's been doing exactly that for three straight decades. Now she has full support of entire D.C behind her back. Even as Kjell mentions one or two good, down to earth generals in Pentagon are not going to be enough, when most of their colleagues lobby for spending and interventions hoping to end up as senior advisors for defense contractor giants. Entire DC, even bah, especially the 'progressive think tanks' (who get funded by things like Lockheed Martin and even Saudi Arabia) is crying for cruise missile strikes on Syria as we speak. 
Mike John Elissen MMChomek ' 6 hours ago Your argumentation for calling Escobar`s points `non-arguments` is, or rather was ao the fact HRC takes office in january (not february as you claimed) 2017, and the new Sarmat will be in service in 2018. To change the subject (Clinton&Co warmongering and making profits 'ì we all know that) does not change the fact Billary needs time to prepare for a war with Russia. You can call Kjell as a `rescue line` all you want, fact remains your own argumentation is `Non`. 
''' Kjell Hasthi MMChomek ' 16 hours ago 'ì Hillary most likely gets to oval office next February Pepe did not say that 
Neil Tana Kjell Hasthi ' 7 hours ago She will. Trump is an idiot and is probably acting that way to drive another agenda because he can't be that stupid. The real questions is how serious is all of this to Russia. I think it is very serious. The US has already shown how they manipulate people to wage war against their government, supply them with weapons, call it a civil war, plant false flags to push it over the edge, call it unhumanitarian to open air war options, then invite others to join in on the fun while selling them weapons in the process to do so. They can easily do this to Russia if Syria falls or not. They just need to excite the 20 million muslims in Russia that borders the middle east. I'd say that Russia is a great risk and should take decisive actions. They could just use air fuel bombs as they are not radioactive but destroy everything in its path like a tactical nuke. To this point, the EU needs to be very worried because they are on the front lines and are sleep walking under the direction of the US who is an ocean away. 
Kjell Hasthi MMChomek ' 14 hours ago 'ì As I said before, I don't believe Trump will win 
That is naiv as both Hillary and Kaine are unpopular. In Pentagon, almost hated. 
MMChomek Kjell Hasthi ' 14 hours ago How is that possible? She is their major job provider. 
Kjell Hasthi MMChomek ' 14 hours ago There are 90 million made redundant Trump is a more attractive candidate for them The polls presented on telly are all manipulated (when compared to independent polls). Hillary is well behind, and she is losing voters these days. The Putin bashing did not save her. 
MMChomek Kjell Hasthi ' 14 hours ago Trump has wowed to pull out of middle east, stop babysitting and subsidizing other NATO members and become buddies with the 'greatest existential threat' e.g Russia 
How is he a more attractive candidate for the Pentagon, than Hillary who's seeking armed confrontation everywhere? 
Kjell Hasthi MMChomek ' 14 hours ago Trump presents the Globalists as an existential threat, and this election as the most important in human history. It is about saving humanity. 
MMChomek Kjell Hasthi ' 14 hours ago I understand and agree, now please try to fit what you've just said into your previous post about Trump being the more attractive choice for the Pentagon, because I'm lost here. 
Kjell Hasthi MMChomek ' 14 hours ago That is new. Some group of (4 stars?) general approached Trump and asked him to be candidate. Their arguments were about stopping madman Hillary. Trump said yes to them 
MMChomek Kjell Hasthi ' 14 hours ago So there is an actual anti-war faction inside the Pentagon? That sounds too good to be true. Most of those guys lobby war like madmen, because they get lucrative advisor contracts with defense industries after they retire. Isn't it just some hearsay? 
''' 
dan kopfz MMChomek ' 11 hours ago Unlike the psychopaths in the white house, the vast majority of the military leadership are not completely insane, and would not meekly follow orders when those orders would mean the lives of millions of Americans. 
Should Hillary push for a no-fly zone, it's not the Russians she'd need to worry about'ìit's a military coup. As everyone knows, in a military coup, you eliminate the current leadership. 
dan kopfz dan kopfz ' 11 hours ago There's another reality that the military would be taking into account, that mad Hillary probably wouldn't. 
China is not stupid. 
An empire doesn't get to be 8000+ years old by making miscalculations. China knows that if the US is willing to commit to a hot war with Russia, than they'd be next if the US won. That means the Chinese would be looking to make sure that the US doesn't win, and given the current tensions in the South China, might join the war on Russia's side as a full ally, openly declaring war against the US. 
Without going nuclear, in an open hot war against China and Russia (and Syria, and Iran, and others), NATO can't win. The Pentagon won't make that miscalculation either. 
Peter Jennings ' 14 hours ago The US have been fighting lame armies filled with soldiers who would rather be somewhere else. Tending to their crops or animals for example. 
Afghanistan isn't going as expected. Libya isn't going as expected. Iraq isn't going as expected. In Syria they have got bogged down, exposing their proxy war to all, when it was initially advertising as 'humanitarian intervention'. 
When it comes to Russia, a determined, battle hardened, well trained army with highly advanced weapons, the US will resemble europe during the last world war. Vote in a warmonger, you will get war, that's where they get their kicks. 
StevenStarr ' 14 hours ago Wishful thinking. 
richardstevenhack ' 4 hours ago Apparently both Alexander Mercouris and Pepe Escobar have succumbed to what is known as 'cognitive dissonance''ì the attitude that because something would be impossible to accept, it therefore is impossible to happen. 
While I would expect some members of the Pentagon to school Clinton on the problems of establishing a no-fly-zone in Syria once she is elected, the fact remains that there is no reason to believe she will accept that position. 
As I've said before, the goal of the Syria crisis is to set the preconditions for a long war with IRAN. First Syria's military has to be degraded, then Israel (and possibly NATO) will attack Hizballah in Lebanon into the Bekaa Valley via Syrian territory. Then and only then can Israel initiate a war with Iran, having more or less 'disarmed' Iran's allies right next to Israel. 
If Israel wants to achieve its goal of taking Iran out of the Middle East picture, and the US military-industrial complex wants to achieve its goal of an expensive, profitable, decades long war with Iran, then Syria has to go. Which means that there will be no let-up in pushing for that result. 
And we all know Hillary Clinton is TOTALLY on board with both aims as a warmongering neocon. 
Did the Bush neocons fail to get the Iraq and Afghan wars started? 
Why, then, should be assume, as Alexander and Pepe do, that Hillary Clinton cannot override any Pentagon reluctance and get a war with Syria started, regardless of the enhanced difficulties presented by the presence of Russia? 
Obama was prepared to go to war with Syria in August, 2013. While Russia was not present at the time to make that a more difficult proposition, it proves that the US IS spoiling for war with Syria. The three UNSC Resolutions submitted by the US early on with Chapter 7 language in them to justify such a war were only vetoed by Russia and China, burned on Libya. They prove the US goal is war with Syria. 
The US is not going to back down just because Russia presents a greater difficulty. Many in the Beltway really believe that if the US attacks, Russia will back down. They are probably wrong, but it will be a little late to find out once the war starts. 
For another thing, the notion that doubling down on supplying weapons such as MANPADs to the insurgents will change the situation is ridiculous 'ì and the Pentagon will inform her of that, too. Which leaves her with only one option: a direct US/NATO attack on Syria. 
Short of a straight-up Pentagon revolt, Clinton can and probably will start a war with Syria and Russia.

NV) accused him of 'tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo,' saying his action 'appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another' ‚Äì claiming he 'may have broken the law,' citing the 1939 Hatch Act (An Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities). It prohibits federal executive branch employees from engaging in certain forms of political activity ‚Äì exempting the president, vice president and designated high-level administration officials. Proof of intent is required to hold someone culpable under the law. .. According to the Wall Street Journal , within the FBI, there was ' sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the Clintons, and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national election campaign.' .. In a prominently featured NYT op-ed , Law Professor Richard Painter said '(w)e cannot allow FBI or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power.' .. Not according to former federal prosecutor Daniel Richman, saying 'Comey's critics cannot show his letter violated the Hatch Act unless they can prove that the FBI director was intending to influence the election rather than inform Congress, which was (his) stated aim.' .. A Sunday released ABC News/Washington Post poll indicated about a third of likely voters are less likely to support Hillary following Comey's October surprise. .. The Washington Post said the Justice Department's public integrity unit blocked the FBI from investigating the Clinton Foundation, claiming inadequate 'evidence to move forward.' The department is run by longtime Bill and Hillary ally, Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Last June, she met privately with the former president at Phoenix's Sky Harbor airport while Hillary was under FBI investigation ‚Äì a clear conflict of interest despite her disingenuously claiming 'no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body' took place. .. In a Washington Post op-ed , former attorney general Eric Holder expressed concern about Comey's 'vague letter to Congress about emails potentially connected to a matter of public, and political, interest' ‚Äì claiming he 'violated long-standing Justice Department policies and tradition.' .. Holder disgraced the office he held. Law Professor Francis Boyle called him 'a total disaster for the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights, Human Rights and the Rule of Law.' Speaking in Florida on Sunday, Hillary changed the subject, saying ' there's a lot of noise and distraction, but it really comes down to what kind of future we want, and what kind of president can help us get there. We won't be distracted no matter what our opponents throw at us.' .. Clearly, Comey's bombshell changed the dynamic of the race, whether enough to derail her White House bid we'll know in days. Reports indicate the FBI will examine an astonishing 650,000 emails from former Congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop ‚Äì estranged husband of top Hillary aide Huma Abedin. .. 
It could take months to review volume this immense, likely extending well beyond November 8 and January's inauguration, to determine if any evidence warrants prosecuting Hillary, Abedin, Weiner or anyone else for mishandling classified government documents, perhaps compromising national security. 
2. INTELLECTUAL LAZINESS & SELF-INFLICTED POLITICAL IDIOCY 
Harvard Undergrads for Hillary 
OVERWHELMING SYSTEMIC PROPAGANDA ALLIED WITH A PERVASIVE INTELLECTUAL LAZINESS CONSPIRE TO KEEP MINDS THAT SHOULD KNOW BETTER FROM SEEING THE MOST ELEMENTARY TRUTHS. BEING OFFICIALLY 'SMART' IS NO VACCINE AGAINST THE BRAINWASH. A ccording to the student newspaper Harvard Crimson's October survey , 87% of undergrads support Hillary. A scant 6% back Trump, 5.8% for Libertarian Gary ('what's Aleppo') Johnson, and less than 1% for Harvard College and Medical School graduate Jill Stein ‚Äì the only people's candidate running. .. Around one-third of undergrads responded (2,128 out of a total 6,645 student body) ‚Äì so the views of nonrespondents aren't known. About 91% are eligible to vote in November. Eligibility begins at age 18. A surprising 96% of respondents intend voting, they said. .. The national average is far lower. Whether this year's contentious election encourages a larger than usual turnout remains to be seen. The Crimson poll was conducted from October 10 ‚Äì 20 ‚Äì before FBI Director Comey's October surprise. Whether it would have changed the results is unknown. Two-thirds of respondents said they support Democrat party candidates, 12% calling themselves Republicans, 19% saying they're independents. .. Trump and Hillary are the most widely reviled presidential aspirants in US history. Yet 70% of Crimson respondents view her favorably ‚Äì showing little knowledge of her deplorable public record since the 1990s unless they support her war crimes, racketeering and perjury. What to make of it? Undergrads enter Harvard (and other colleges) as teenagers, young and naive as I was when entering the college long ago. .. After graduation, I discovered the meaning of the term 'commencement.' Institutions like Harvard teach students to be good citizens, omitting the ugly stuff about US imperialism, officials advancing it, waging endless wars of aggression. .. The so-called Korean War was ongoing when I was there, an incentive to maintain good grades, stay in school, avoid being drafted and sent to North Korea's frozen Chosin, an expression used by members of my class. .. The Paper Chase Hollywood film (1973) featured John Houseman as stern Harvard Law School Professor Charles Kingsfield. His most memorable line on day one for first year students was saying '(y)ou teach yourselves the law, but I train your minds. You come here with a skull full of mush. You leave thinking like a lawyer.' .. I began my freshman year 'with a skull full of mush,' gradually extracting it. College and graduate school taught me to think. Learning and comprehension mostly came later. The older I get, the greater my understanding of world and national issues. .. I'm long removed from campus life. Back then, students had none of the advantages available today ‚Äì no computers, no Internet. Daily writing I dearly love now was a dreaded chore back then ‚Äì requiring research by rolodex cards and library stacks, a time-consuming process. Except for the type primary research I did for my master's thesis, most everything needed today for compositions or articles like mine is available on our desktops. .. It's understandable why young minds haven't achieved the wisdom of the ages. Still it's disturbing to find Harvard undergrads uninformed and out-of-touch on Hillary's deplorable public record ‚Äì when it's so easy to research it and know what she and husband Bill are all about. .. Why hasn't the Harvard student body done its homework for perhaps the most important election in our lifetime. The stakes are huge ‚Äì possible war on Russia with Hillary empowered or improved bilateral relations under Trump. Nothing matters more than saving humanity from the scourge of catastrophic thermonuclear war able to kill us all.

Why I Won't Vote for Hillary Clinton | Evan Edinger' (but then he changes his mind on that) TO CLOSE : Evan Edlinger will vote for Hillary against Trump because he thinks that whereas Hillary's actual track-record of policies (not mere statements) in public office have been horrific, Trump's bad statements and lack of any track-record in public office at all, make Trump even worse. That's what he thinks. I think it makes Trump better ‚Äî the better choice ‚Äî as opposed to the proven evil and catastrophically harmful public official, Hillary Clinton. Edlinger is preferring an evil record as a public official, to no record as a public official. Edlinger fails to make two crucial distinctions: One is that he fails to distinguish between mere political statements, versus actual political policies carried out as a public official (which show Hillary to be a proven neocon and tool of Wall Street); and the other is his failing to distinguish between a bad record in a person's private or business affairs, versus a bad record as an actual public official. Only the bad record as a public official should be absolutely disqualifying ‚Äî and that's Clinton, not Trump, who has a horrific record as a public official. Trump has no record at all as a public official. Edlinger at 1:30 in his video says that when he contemplates voting for Hillary,'There's always one thing that comes in the way, and that's trust.' He says he doesn't trust her ‚Äî but what he doesn't actually 'trust' is her words; when he says he'll vote for her, he's simply ignoring her actions, he's ignoring the real person-as-a-public-official, the person who is shown and displayed beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever. Proven selfishness in one's private life is bad, but proven selfishness and evil in one's public-office policies (such as 'We came, we saw, he died. Ha, ha!' ) is utterly disqualifying. I argued in my 'I'm a Bernie Sanders Voter: Here's Why I'll Vote Trump' , that Trump could possibly turn out to be a progressive President; but, even if he turns out to be a bad President, he won't, on balance, be as horrific as will a President Hillary Clinton. With Trump, there is reason to have some hope for the future of the world; with Clinton, there is reason to expect unprecedented horrors .

NOTE: The Greanville Post editors have a clear position on this so-called election: If you MUST vote, vote Green, for the Jill Stein, Ajamu Baraka ticket, as a PROTEST VOTE. If that is not possible in your area, do not bother to vote, as all votes serve to legitimate a fraudulent process and the ongoing reign of the corporate/military/media complex. =SUBSCRIBE TODAY!

Photo by Jedimentat44 | CC BY 2.0 I would not rank Vladimir Putin high on a list of leaders. If I lived in Russia I'd be working for major reforms in my government, just as I'm doing where I do live, in the United States. I regularly go on Russian media and criticize the Russian government. Russia is illegally and immorally bombing people in Syria, just as the United States is doing in Syria, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. But there are Putin Halloween masks for sale in U.S. stores. Time magazine has Putin on the cover accusing him of trying to damage U.S. elections. A Google search for 'Hitler Putin' brings back 11 million results. This demonization of a foreign leader should frighten us more than that leader himself. Wars do not only kill, if they kill at all, a foreign leader. But they do kill large numbers of children, grandparents, mothers, and fathers. They enrage people, endanger us, damage the natural environment, justify the removal of our rights, and divert unfathomable resources from areas where they could have done a world of good. The actual Adolph Hitler had no plans or ability to invade the United States and was defeated primarily by Russians who lost at least 27 million lives in the process. For over 70 years, since the end of World War II, the United States has bombed dozens of nations, and in every case that I am aware of U.S. officials have labeled a targeted individual 'Hitler.' In May the Politico newspaper reported on Pentagon testimony in Congress to the effect that Russia had a superior and threatening military, but followed that with this: ''This is the 'Chicken-Little, sky-is-falling' set in the Army,' the senior Pentagon officer said. 'These guys want us to believe the Russians are 10 feet tall. There's a simpler explanation: The Army is looking for a purpose, and a bigger chunk of the budget. And the best way to get that is to paint the Russians as being able to land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. What a crock.' Politico then cited a less-than-credible 'study' of Russian military superiority and aggression and added: 'While the reporting about the Army study made headlines in the major media, a large number in the military's influential retired community, including former senior Army officers, rolled their eyes.' The United States has overseen the expansion of NATO to Russia's border. The buffer zone of the last Cold War is gone. U.S./NATO missile bases are now in Romania and being built in Poland. The U.S. has organized in Eastern Europe the largest military exercises seen there since World War II. The U.S. role in supporting a violent coup that created an anti-Russian government in Ukraine was exposed before the coup. When the people of Crimea voted overwhelmingly to rejoin Russia, the U.S. media characterized Russian actions that resulted in total casualties of zero as 'an invasion of Ukraine.' Without presenting us with any evidence, the U.S. government has accused Russia of shooting down an airplane, of exposing the corruption within the Democratic National Committee (shouldn't we be grateful?), and of somehow sabotaging the upcoming U.S. election. Every atrocity committed by Russia or Syria in Syria is big news. Every U.S. atrocity there is a yawn. The stakes are high every time the United States overthrows a government. The disasters of Iraq and Libya have fueled the current catastrophes in those countries and Syria and around the region. But the stakes are higher when the United States and Russia confront each other. These are nuclear nations. Russia has announced that it is considering re-opening a base in Cuba. The Cuban Missile Crisis, in case anyone has forgotten, was one of the many times since the creation of nuclear weapons that humanity has come close to intentionally or accidentally destroying itself. The nukes are of far greater strength now. And our understanding has grown of how a limited nuclear war anywhere on earth would create a crop-destroying nuclear winter followed by mass starvation. We don't need to take this sort of risk. To avoid it we need to turn away from war. And that means we need to stop using human rights abuses by targeted governments as excuses to bomb people. We should protect human rights through leadership by example and consistent application of the rule of law. Doing so would then open the United States up to the possibility of opposing human rights abuses by some of the nasty governments that it props up and sells or gives weapons to, beginning perhaps with Saudi Arabia, a monarchy that makes Vladimir Putin look like Mohandas Gandhi.

[Photo: Corporate dairy Credit: Gunnar Richter Namenlos.net.] W itnesses to H istory CALEB T. MAUPIN Editor's Note Food, and the related agricultural, policies are complex and tied to both foreign and domestic policies. This is because the United States has been 'the breadbasket of the world.' Unlike many nations, the US has remarkable amount of land (and until recently) climate suitable for production of a wide array of both crops and 'livestock' (cruel humor to call it that). As Mr. Maupin discusses some of those complexities, it is important to remember that 'large' agriculture is primarily corporate, and that is a different world than that of the small farmer. Since the advent of corporate agriculture, the small farmer has been fair game. The organic and clean food revolution saved many small farmers, but corporations are taking that over as well. Further, when we look at farm subsidies, those are also primarily geared towards (and benefit) agri-business.
Another side of this dreadful slide in food production is the closing of food outlets be those (continuously disappearing) small grocers and minute-marts, or the mega-stores of Wal-Mart, Safeway, etc. This creates a growing number of food deserts. These are essentially areas where wholesome, affordable food is available. Most ignored are the rural food deserts. The USDA has an interactive map of U.S. food deserts. Also problematic on the consumer side of the equation are the food subsidy programs. Most in kind (actual food) subsidies are destroyed, fed to livestock, or shipped out of the country EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A SURFEIT OF HUNGRY PEOPLE TO EAT THEY. The argument being that these surpluses would compete with the third part vendors making a profit. Therefore, we had food stamps, then SNAP (see sidebar). The later being a true insult ‚Äì particularly if you are in the middle of a food desert. U S Foods Holding Corporation and Sysco, the two top American food distribution giants, are laying off thousands of workers. Wal-Mart is closing stores and terminating employees. As the price of eggs, beef, cheese, and almost all agricultural products have dropped, farmers across the United States are facing financial ruin.
The ongoing glut in agricultural products is not merely the natural cycle of the market at work. Policies of the US federal government are directly linked to the low food prices. While it is clear that the ongoing agricultural surplus is very bad for the US public, the government seems to have other priorities. Broken Promises From Politicians 
The agricultural prowess of the United States is known across the planet. The current president of China first visited the United States in 1985. He didn't come to see the Statue of Liberty, or the Washington Monument. Rather, Xi Jinping visited Iowa in order to study the technology and farming techniques employed by some of the most advanced and efficient farmers in the world . The Holt family dairy. 
Love for the small farmers is voiced by almost all sectors of US political establishment, and almost always has been. The writings of Thomas Jefferson spoke at length about the 'yeoman' and his role in an ideal republic. The left-wing folk singer Pete Seeger sang about how 'the farmer is man who feeds them all .' Right-wing Radio host Paul Harvey plucked the heart strings of the American public with his 'So God Made a Farmer' speech in 1978 . 
Each election year, American politicians devote special attention to the Iowa caucuses, the first vote in determining who will be the major parties' respective nominees. As they travel across the Midwestern agricultural state, the presidential hopefuls routinely make all kinds of speeches championing 'the hard working farmers.' 
While politicians are known to make promises to the farmers, and seem to recognize that agriculture is essential to the US economy, the policies of recent years, most of them having bipartisan support, have been anything but beneficial to those who work the land. In the current presidential race, Iowa is hotly contested, with Trump and Clinton very close in the polls. The farm glut, spawned by federal policies, is undoubtedly a big factor . 
In the first 8 months of 2016, 43 million gallons of milk were poured out due to the glut. According to the Wall Street Journal: 'Farmers across the US are pouring out tens of millions of gallons of milk amid massive over glut that has reduced prices and filled warehouses with cheese .' 
Meanwhile, another WSJ article reports: 'Cattle and hog prices hover near the lowest levels in years as U.S. meat packers produce the largest volume of meat in history .' Between July of 2016 and July of 2017, the price of milk has decreased by 11%. The price of eggs has decreased by 40% . SNAP was not implemented by Obama. It replaced food stamps in 2008 and the acronym was not accidental. It redefined food assistance to both 'supplemental' and short term . The fact that for many the supplement is the mainstay of their family's diet is apparently lost on the conservative(ly) compassionate republicons. The overproduction and under-consumption of agricultural products can be directly linked to federal policies. Throughout his administration, Barack Obama has repeatedly cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and reduced the amount of food that low income families are able to purchase. The cutting of this federal program directly takes food from the mouths of low-income Americans. Despite the fact that according to the US Department of Agriculture, 13% of American households are now food insecure, the cuts have continued, and hunger is rising among America's poor .
In addition to the obvious impact on low-income Americans, the cuts in food stamps have also cut into food sales. Food producing corporations and small farmers have seen a decrease in their sales. Wal-Mart has laid off thousands of workers and closed thousands of stores. These losses and layoffs can be linked directly to the SNAP cuts . 
Congress has recently discussed a plan that would eventually take $150 billion out of the federal food assistance program, a move that would undoubtedly push a lot of food producers, retail employees, and meat packers over the edge, along with many others . 
The reductions in food assistance are not the only factor. The economic sanctions against Russia have played a dramatic role in creating the current food glut. The collapse and breaking up of the Soviet Union's collective farm system during the Yeltsin era of the 1990s dramatically reduced Russia's domestic food production. This opened up new markets for American farmers, who greatly increased their exports to the former USSR. 
However, the new sanctions imposed in 2014, which restrict US and EU agricultural sales to Russia, have dramatically changed the landscape of the global food market. American farmers have been deprived of 143.5 million potential customers due to the ban on selling to those living in the Russian Federation. Austerity & Fascism Leave Farmers Behind And why is it that 'austerity' is always aimed at those who have the least first and most harshly? Why is food assistance to low income families being cut? The claim is that the US federal budget is too large, and that hard economic times mandate austerity. However, the United States still has the largest military budget on the planet. When it comes time to reduce spending, rather than cutting the amount of money spent on tanks, bombs, and drones, the politicians have opted to cut into the nutrition of low-income Americans, along with the livelihoods of farmers and agricultural workers. The thousands of military bases around the world, along with the billions given in foreign military aid to countries like Israel, all seem be far more important to US leaders.
And why has the US drastically restricted the exporting agricultural products to Russia? The sanctions were enacted in 2014, in response to the Ukraine crisis. The elected President of Ukraine, Victor Yanukovich, was toppled in orgy of street violence. The new government, with a base of support only in the western regions of the country, has within its ranks many open admirers of Adolf Hitler, and is very hostile to Russia. 
Since 2014, the people of Eastern Ukraine have taken up arms to resist the new regime. The people in the region of Crimea voted to become apart of the Russian Federation, whose military they had been hosting since the collapse of the USSR. Sanctions were imposed on Russia and continue, based on allegations that Russia is supporting the resistance of people in the Eastern regions against the new, pro-Western regime. US leaders tell us the sanctions are intended to punish Russia for 'meddling' in Ukraine. 
Since the passing of the sanctions, Russia has revived its own domestic agricultural programs. Small farmers across Russia are producing beef, wheat, and other products no longer sold to them by the US and the EU. Russian agriculture has experienced a boom since 2014, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is even more popular than prior to the crisis . 
The decision of US leaders to wage economic warfare against Russia in support of a Ukrainian government that contains many with fascist sympathies, while at the same time cutting assistance to low-income American families, is contrary to values often displayed throughout American history. Both Lincoln and Roosevelt saw prosperity for the agricultural heartland of the United States and the millions who lived in it as vitally important for the entire country. These two most beloved Presidents in US history both worked closely in alliance with small farmers, often in opposition to Wall Street bankers with different interests. 
The rallying cry of the Republican Party in its early years, was 'Free Land, Free Labor, Free Men!' The 'Free Soilers,' farmers who wanted to halt the expansion of slavery in new US territories were an essential part of it. While slavery found support in the financial districts of London and New York, the small farmers had a material interest in ending the barbaric practice, and anti-slavery militias appeared in Iowa and Kansas years before the Civil War broke out. 
It was a broad coalition of small farmers, religious abolitionists, and organized labor that eventually put Abraham Lincoln into the White House where he was forced to battle the slaveholders. The process that unfolded recreated the country, in what is widely called 'The Second American Revolution.' 'An American Government Cannot Allow Americans To Starve' 
The programs that preceded the currently existing Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) were the brainchild of Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace, who eventually became the Vice President. When the first 'food stamps' were issued in 1939, the director of the program, Milo Perkins described it this way: 'We got a picture of a gorge, with farm surpluses on one cliff and under-nourished city folks with outstretched hands on the other. We set out to find a practical way to build a bridge across that chasm .' 
While Roosevelt was universally hated by Wall Street bankers, he was very popular with organized labor, artists and musicians, as well as small farmers. As the unemployment councils and labor unions fought for a better life across the country, Roosevelt aligned himself with the mass movement in the streets. Essential in Roosevelt's progressive coalition was the US Communist Party, an organization that sought to build a 'Workers and Farmer's Government.' When big business objected to Roosevelt's dramatic economic reforms, he defended them by saying 'an American government cannot allow Americans to s tarve .' 
Roosevelt later aligned with the Russian people in order to defeat Adolf Hitler. FDR's opposition to fascism and his policies of feeding of hungry Americans while subsidizing farmers were not isolated from each other. They corresponded with his overall view of the world, expressed in 1944: 'We cannot be content, no matter how high that general standard of living may be, if some fraction of our people‚Äîwhether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth- is ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill housed, and insecure‚Ä¶. We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence‚Ä¶. People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made .' 
In 2016, things are very different. While banks were bailed out without hesitation during the 2008 financial crisis, financial assistance to low income Americans continues to be cut. Wall Street and London see the Eurasian Bloc of Russia and China as a rising competitor to their financial hegemony. The wealthy financial elite largely support sanctions and further isolation of both countries despite whatever disastrous impact on American farmers, agricultural workers, and food distributors. 
Children across the United States are hungry, as 13% of households are food insecure, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Farm workers and those who work for food distributors and supermarkets are losing their jobs. Gallons of milk are at this moment being dumped out in hopes of raising the prices, while food warehouses sit filled with rotting, unsold cheese. 
Meanwhile, US and NATO forces are increasing their presence in Eastern Europe, threatening Russia. As agricultural sanctions on Russia continue, weapons and training are being provided to a Ukrainian military that is known to contain a number fascist sympathizers, including the infamous Azov Battalion. 
As discontent rises in the United States, it is largely centered in the agricultural and de-industrialized mid-western heartland. It is clear that many Americans desperately want something to change. A government that prioritizes fascistic elements in Ukraine over farmers in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Ohio, is clearly out of touch. Caleb Maupin Is an American journalist and political analyst.

[Photo: Syria is a hornet's nest not a pinata. Credit: Daryl Cagle .] =By= John Feffer Editor's Note Was there an end game in mind when the U.S. decided to fuel a rural conflict rooted in almost five years of drought into a 'civil war' and then an outright attempt at regime change? Was there a plan for the (effectively) mercenary force the U.S. created who after training found that ISIS paid much better, so the U.S. rebooked al Nusra and al Qaeda from terrorist groups to 'moderate''rebels. Of course there is the off shore oil and Israel's interest in the territory and region. But who gave a thought for the people of Syria? They were all mostly 'civilians,' just like in almost any country ‚Äì until they were forced to pick a side or be shot. Where is the peace to be found if the goal is still to remove the recognized government (for better or worse) of Syria? Yet another blood red 'color' revolution. T he war in Syria is a nightmare. It's a nightmare for all the civilians who suffer from constant aerial bombardment, who are trapped without food and medical assistance inside crumbling cities, who experience the retribution of either the Islamic State or the regime in Damascus. It's a nightmare for those who try to escape and face the prospect of death in transit or limbo in refugee camps. Syria is a nightmare for individuals, millions of them. But it's not just that. If states could dream, then Syria would be their nightmare as well. Syria was once a sovereign state like any other. It had a central government and fixed boundaries. The Syrian state enjoyed a monopoly on violence and, on several occasions, deployed that violence against its citizenry to devastating effect. The economy functioned, more or less, with considerable revenue coming from the oil sector. In 2009, tourism accounted for 12 percent of the economy. Not that long ago and despite its many problems, Syria attracted a large number of eager travelers. In perhaps the most ironic twist, the Syrian state once had delusions of grandeur. It wanted to abolish the old colonial boundaries and unify the entire Arab world. Under Hafez al-Assad, its authoritarian ruler from 1970 until 2000, Syria attempted to absorb Lebanon, unite with Egypt and Libya in a short-lived Federation of Arab Republics, displace Iraq as the undisputed ideological leader in the region, and even take charge of the Palestinian cause.
How quickly dreams can segue into nightmares. Syria has fallen in upon itself, fracturing into four distinct pieces. The government in Damascus controls a gerrymandered slice of territory around the capital and the coast. The Kurds have carved out an autonomous region along the Turkish border in the northeast. The Islamic State still claims a large expanse in the heart of the country. And various rebel factions have secured a patchwork of land in all four corners of what had once been a unified Syria. 
The government in Damascus, needless to say, no longer enjoys its monopoly on violence. It can't control the borders of the country. The economy shrank by 19 percent in 2015 and will probably contract another 8 percent this year. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have died in the current conflict. Out of a pre-war population of 23 million, nearly half have fled their homes‚Äî4.8 million leaving the country and 6.6 million displaced internally. The war, according to one estimate, has cost over $250 billion. 
Much like the Balkans before it, Syria is emerging as a metaphor for the fragmentation and chaos that the modern world barely contains. Many states are held together by little more than surface tension, like the meniscus of liquid that rises above the sides of a glass. Nationalism has reached a boiling point in many places, as has religious extremism. Armaments are everywhere, militias are proliferating, and violence has become pervasive. After scoring a number of impressive victories‚Äîin Northern Ireland, in East Timor, most recently in Colombia‚Äîinternational diplomats are stymied by the breakdown of order in places like Syria, Libya, Sudan, and Somalia. The countries jockeying for influence in Syria today face many of the same divisive forces that have torn apart that benighted country. The dream of these intervening powers: to turn the current war to their advantage. Their nightmare: that whatever is tearing apart Syria is contagious. The Illusion of Totalitarianism 
There is no such thing as a totalitarian state. Some dictators, of course, imagine that they can create just such a state, in which the government is a mere extension of the leader's will and no significant opposition challenges this central authority. Such a society is a pyramid with one person at the top, every block serving to support that uppermost platform. Mere authoritarian societies tolerate potential rival sources of power, such as an intelligentsia or a business sector. In the ideal totalitarian system, all is for one and one is for all. 
Even North Korea under the Kim dynasty‚ÄîKim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Eun‚Äîfails to achieve this kind of totalitarian control. True, the government has managed to suppress virtually every sign of political dissent, indigenous NGOs are practically non-existent, and all culture is subordinate to the state. However, private markets have sprung up beyond the state's compete control (though, as a sign of grudging acceptance, the state taxes the sellers). Citizens watch contraband movies and listen to taboo music thanks to flash drives smuggled in from China. There have even been signs of disagreement at the highest levels of governance (or so the execution of Kim Jong Eun's uncle Jang Song Thaek suggests). 
Once upon a time, the leader of Syria also hoped to create a totalitarian dynasty in the heart of the Middle East. Hafez al-Assad embraced a version of Baathism, the anti-colonial, nationalist, pan-Arabist, and nominally socialist hybrid that emerged from the ideological tumult of the 1940s. As in North Korea, Assad created a one-party state with an extensive secret police, the Mukhabarat. He ruthlessly eliminated opposition, as in 1982 when the state brutally suppressed an uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood. After a brief excursion into reform, the designated successor, Assad's son Bashar, followed in his father's footsteps. He attempted to extinguish the Arab Spring uprising just as his father had dealt with the Islamists. The current war is the result of Bashar al-Assad's failure to perceive the declining power of his unitary state. 
As much as the younger Assad would have liked to maintain a firm grip on power, Syria 2012 was a much different place from Syria 1982. During those 30 years, the bonds that had kept the country together had weakened. Popular organizations had begun to demand democracy. Groups defined by their ethnicity saw the potential for greater autonomy. Religious organizations sensed an opportunity to dislodge what had once been a distinctly secular regime. Other centers of power had appeared in Syrian society, and the Baathist regime was ill equipped to deal with this kind of pluralism. 
This scenario might seem unique. It isn't. Disharmonious pluralism has become the new global standard. Other countries‚ÄîTurkey, Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the EU, even the United States‚Äîgaze upon the Syrian example and tremble. It Can Happen Here 
Stripped of its magic sovereignty, Syria has been turned into a pi√±ata whose hidden treasures are now available for all to see and seize. Even as they continue to wield their bats, the intervening powers can't help but perceive how quickly sovereignty can disappear and how little prevents them from becoming pi√±atas in turn. 
Turkish leaders, for instance, must be quite aware of the structural features their country shares with Syria. The glue that has traditionally held together modern Turkey‚ÄîKemalism, named for the father of Turkey, Kemal Ataturk‚Äîhas a somewhat Baathist flavor. It, too, is anti-colonial, nationalist, and secular. Kemalism, like Baathism, has unified an extraordinarily diverse country. Where ideology has proven insufficient, the central government, as in Syria, has used considerable firepower to suppress any movement‚Äîbut particularly the Kurds in the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)‚Äîthat challenges the territorial integrity of the country. Turkey's current leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wants to consolidate power internally and project Turkish influence throughout the Middle East (and beyond). Syria has long been integral to this dual project. The two countries mended fences in the early 2000s when Syria figured prominently in Turkey's 'zero problems with neighbors' policy. Once Assad's position became tenuous during the Arab Spring, however, Erdogan saw an opportunity to switch horses. As the conflict deepened, and no horse emerged as a clear winner, Erdogan decided to use the cover of war to bomb the PKK and their supporters over the border. He hoped to identify a 'responsible' Kurdish faction with which to do business‚Äîas Ankara has done with Kurdistan in Iraq. More recently, by creating a 'safe zone' in northern Syria, Turkey plans to resettle Syrian refugees now in Turkish camps and use that as a base of operations for promoting Turkish business in post-war reconstruction. The Nightmare 
That's the dream, anyway. The nightmare is not far away. The failed coup in July was a rather inept demonstration of the latent anxiety in certain sectors about Erdogan's consolidation of domestic power. The rekindled war with the Kurds in the southeast reveals the continued ethnic divide in the country. So far, Erdogan has cleverly combined the secularist Kemalism and the soft-pedaled Islamism of his Justice and Development Party into a Turkey-first nationalism. But blowback from Syria‚Äîfrom Kurds, from Islamic State supporters, from a disgruntled Turkish army‚Äîcould open up a rift in Erdogan's coalition, and Turkey would then be on the verge of turning into a Syria. 
Even though it follows a very different operating system, Iran, too, looks on Syria as a cautionary example. The government in Tehran is currently split between reformers under President Hassan Rouhani and the religious hardliners who constantly fret over theological deviations. The Green Movement that emerged around the 2009 elections revealed strong opposition to the theocrats within the urban middle class. If Rouhani and his cohort are not able to take full advantage of the nuclear deal and Iran's reentry into the global economy, Iran could slide backward economically‚Äîand then, after the next elections, politically‚Äîto the days of Mahmoud Ahmadine- jad. Disenchanted with formal politics, the next iteration of the Green Movement might give up on peaceful demonstrations and plunge Iran into its own civil war. Saudi Arabia seems like a solid enough entity at the moment. But it too faces a religious challenge from its Wahhabist fringes and a potential territorial challenge from minority Shia in the Eastern Province. The House of Saud rules with an iron fist, and its Committee for the Protection of Virtue and Prevention of Vice intrudes into the private lives of the citizens. The collapse of oil prices has put a squeeze on the kingdom's finances, which will inevitably open up cleavages within Saudi society. In the absence of a strong national identity, Saudi Arabia could fracture along tribal lines, much like Somalia. 
These challenges are not limited to the Middle East. The European Union faces multiple centrifugal forces ‚ÄîBrexit, defaulting economies, a restive Russia. Euroskeptics decry the undemocratic power wielded by political institutions in Brussels. The crisis in Syria is by no means abstract for European countries. The influx of Syrian refugees has driven a huge wedge between countries that want nothing to do with them (particularly Eastern Europe) and countries that want to share the burden equally. The disintegration of Syria is now integrally linked to the disintegration of Europe, which might seem fitting to those who believe in the vengeful ghosts of colonialism. 
The United States is far away from the Syrian conflict, and so far the Obama administration has limited the number of incoming refugees to 10,000 (compared to more than a million that Europe has accepted). The issue of immigrants has certainly divided the two major presidential candidates, and there is no consensus at the top on Syria policy‚Äîthe recent ceasefire agreement exposed a serious fault line between the State Department (let's work with the Russians) and the Pentagon (really, the Russians?). But Syria won't set Americans against Americans as it has pitted Europeans against themselves. Moreover, despite considerable disagreement in the highest reaches of American power on a range of other issues‚Äîbetween Congress and the president, within the Supreme Court, between states and the federal authority‚Äîthese conflicts have been paralyzing rather than fissiparous. 
The more serious concern is the sheer number of guns in the United States‚Äîover 300 million‚Äîand their greater public visibility. You can now carry around your gun openly in 45 states, and more than 14 million people have permits to do so. The number of anti-government militia groups has been rising steadily since the election of Barack Obama in 2008. Trust in the federal government has fallen to record lows. Approximately one in four Americans want their states to secede from the union. Divisions between rich and poor, white and black, native born and immigrants have widened. Ordinarily, all this roiling discontent could be contained by a well-functioning economy or by a set of foreign enemies to focus American enmity. But the election of a much-disliked president next year‚Äîtake your pick‚Äîmay well prove to be a tipping point. It doesn't take much to turn a well-armed population into a mob. 
And that, of course, is the ultimate nightmare for Turkey and Iran and Saudi Arabia and the United States‚Äîwhen Syria ceases to be a gloomy metaphor for what is happening outside its borders and becomes instead a grim reality.

shorty By Danny Haiphong E ven as the Democrats and Republicans put forward the two least popular politicians in the country, the U.S. Left 'is mired in confusion as to what political direction should be taken.' Many of those who claim to be leftists supported the wars against Libya and Syria. But the Green Party has 'consistently stood up against endless war, austerity, and racist state repression and for universal healthcare, education, and peace.' 'The Green Party is the only choice that possesses a truly social democratic agenda.' I consider myself a Marxist. However, the term 'Marxist' is merely a label. Those who ascribe to the tenets of Marxist thought must place their political affiliations within the context of the current historical moment. Anti-communism and imperialist hegemony have set back the struggle for a classless society to the point where much of the US left is mired in confusion as to what political direction should be taken to confront the challenges before us. One of these challenges is the 2016 elections. The radical left should plan on voting Green this November and building a mass movement around the demands put forward by the Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka campaign. But the corporate assault on the left's collective consciousness has indeed made it difficult for the Green Party to grab the attention of the masses in the midst of the two-party capitalist circus. I myself argued two summers ago that the left in the United States should not bother with engaging the charade and instead take up a boycott of the Presidential elections [3] . At that point, no movement had emerged to challenge the hegemony of the Democratic Party. The 2016 elections changed this dynamic. Suddenly, the forces in front of the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Black Lives Matter movement agreed that both corporate candidates were unworthy of support. 'Hillary Clinton has drawn the entire ruling class into the Democratic Party tent.' The energy of these movements was channeled into the Bernie Sanders campaign. Sanders ran as a Democrat. His domestic positions on education, healthcare, and income inequality were supported by masses of young voters. Sanders eventually betrayed his base in typical Democratic Party fashion, but not before it was revealed that the Democratic National Committee had worked diligently to undermine Sanders' ability to win the nomination [4] . The majority of Sanders supporters and sympathizers have since indicated that they will not vote for Clinton when election day arrives [5] . So why vote for the Green Party in particular? The Green Party is the only choice that possesses a truly social democratic agenda. The Green Party is no Marxist vehicle and it doesn't attempt to be. What the Green Party does possess are dedicated, principled forces whose positions on war and peace, healthcare, and predatory capitalism threaten the US imperialist apparatus. That is why the two-party corporate duopoly finances its own corporation [6] to bar the Green Party from entrance into the Presidential debates every four years. In the 2016 elections in particular, a real chance was present to organize the 15 percent of pollsters necessary for the Green Party to participate in the corporately controlled debates. The opportunity was squandered by a left that remains weak and fractured. In the past, attempts to organize an election boycott campaign or support a communist party's Presidential nomination would have sufficed as election strategies to steer the disillusioned populace toward movement politics. However, the 2016 Presidential election is a watershed moment in US imperial history. Hillary Clinton has drawn the entire ruling class into the Democratic Party tent. This has occurred in the midst of the greatest crisis of legitimacy the US imperial state has ever faced. 'Both corporate media and capitalist enterprise supported Clinton's bid to steer the election in her favor.' Sanders and Trump shook the foundation of the two-party corporate duopoly. The rise of Sanders and Trump made the Clinton option desirable only to the ruling class and its minions. Both corporate media and capitalist enterprise supported Clinton's bid to steer the election in her favor. Not only did the ruling class help her take out Sanders, but it also assisted Clinton in a cover up of the recent WikiLeaks email dump. In emails written by her campaign chair John Podesta, it was revealed that the Clinton campaign planned to use the Trump campaign as right-wing cannon fodder to present Clinton as more electable [7] . Furthermore, the emails also uncovered how Clinton holds a ' public' and 'private' position [8] on matters of Social Security and free trade. If left up to Clinton, Social Security retirement benefits and federal regulations of corporate activity would be swept into the dustbin of history. Additionally, the corporate media and the Democratic Party have attempted to frame Donald Trump as a racist, misogynistic pig. According to the Democratic Party, Trump represents the 'Worst of America [9] .' The slander of Trump has been an easy job. Trump himself provides all of the ammo. However, the condemnation of Trump is little more than a convenient distraction when it comes from the corporate Democrats. From Bill Clinton to Barack Obama, the Democratic Party has waged endless war, austerity, and racist state repression on behalf of its corporate masters. Hillary Clinton must resort to fear-mongering around Trump because neither her party nor her class has anything to offer the majority of the US electorate. Conditions are thus ripe for an alternative political party to make a strong showing in this and future Presidential elections. The Green Party's success could inspire the millions of people disillusioned with both choices and show that a mass sentiment against the two-party corporate duopoly does indeed exist. It is the task of communists, radicals, and revolutionaries to organize the disaffected into a class conscious organization capable of stripping power from the ruling class. No such organization exists at the moment. The Green Party doesn't profess to be this organization, but its demands and platform are surely helpful if utilized to create the conditions required for such an organization to emerge. 'If left up to Clinton, Social Security retirement benefits and federal regulations of corporate activity would be swept into the dustbin of history.' So when self-identified leftists make the claim that the left deserves better than Jill Stein [10] , the urgent need for self-criticism becomes clear. One only needs to examine conditions in the US briefly to see that oppressed and working class people deserve better than the left. Of course, the left's current state is a reflection of the conditions from which it exists and the deep imperialist assault on the consciousness of the oppressed. However, the left has made critical errors in recent years. Many so-called revolutionary organizations have, for example, supported imperialist war in Libya and promoted the notion of lesser evil voting as cover for the Democratic Party. Green Party candidates Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka have consistently stood up against endless war, austerity, and racist state repression and for universal healthcare, education, and peace. Yet there are some who want to claim that such a platform is not adequate or 'revolutionary' enough. It is time to shed this sectarian way of thinking. Hillary Clinton will become the next President of the US. She will inherit the eight years of Obama rule which have further weakened the left. But the 2016 elections have revealed that the deep crisis of the imperialist system is beginning to intersect with popular opposition to its policy manifestations. So don't fear Trump or organize resistance in a manner that gives the people a choice of either revolution or nothing at all. There is nothing counterrevolutionary about voting Green this November and organizing the movement on the streets around its core demands. As BAR's Bruce Dixon noted last week, a five percent showing by the Green Party will put much needed federal funds into the control of movement organizers. A revolution is not a moment, it is a process. The crisis of imperialism will present many more moments to develop the revolutionary potential of the masses. The current opportunity to do so should not be allowed to dissipate, as the next moment could occur alongside a Hillary Clinton-led world war.

Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN A ccording to Professor David Bosco , writing in Foreign Policy, '(t)he prosecutor's office of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is ready to initiate a full investigation of a range of possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan, including some by US personnel, according to several knowledgeable sources.' MAIN PHOTO: Kissinger, international war criminal at large. He will die in his bed‚Äîlike Pinochet and Franco‚Äîand totally escape justice. The American media can be counted on to eulogize him as a great and 'tough-minded statesman.' Bet on it. 'The ICC move would mark the first time that a formal ICC investigation has scrutinized US actions and sets up a possible collision with Washington. Established by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on July 1, 2002, it's mandated to prosecute individuals for genocide and aggression, as well as crimes of war and against humanity. Instead, it functions solely as an imperial tool, supports powerful interests, targets independent states Washington and other Western nations oppose. It lets America, its NATO partners, Israel and their rogue allies get away with mass murder. .. Bosco cites unnamed sources, indicating chief ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda 'will seek to initiate an investigation in the coming weeks, likely after the US presidential election but before the end of the year‚Ä¶ US officials visited The Hague,' letting her know who's boss. It's unclear where she intends to go. On October 7, 2001, US-led NATO forces attacked Afghanistan without just cause ‚Äì less than four weeks post-9/11, naked aggression planned months before that fateful day. .. Appalling war crimes followed, continuing daily. All post-WW II US wars were and continue being waged illegally against nonbelligerent countries reflecting over 70 years of unaccountability. No US government or military official ever faced charges for Nuremberg-level high crimes. It's irrelevant what Bensouda does or doesn't do. The 2002 American Service Members' Protection Act (ASPA, aka The Hague Invasion Act) 'protect(s) United States military personnel and other elected and appointed officials of the United States government against criminal prosecution by an international court to which the United States is not party.' .. CIA boss and notorious war criminal Richard Helms. This scoundrel died in 2002, so he definitely escaped justice. 
It authorizes the president to use 'all means necessary and appropriate to bring about the release of any US or allied personnel being detained or imprisoned by, on behalf of, or at the request of the International Criminal Court.' It prohibits the extradition of anyone from America to the ICC. In a November 2000 open letter, Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Zbigniew Brzezinki, former CIA director Richard Helms and other US signatories said Washington must put 'our nation's military personnel safely beyond the reach of an unaccountable international prosecutor operating under procedures inconsistent with our Constitution.' .. Kissinger's high crimes are well-documented. Brzezinski got Jimmy Carter to sign a secret directive, authorizing aid for Mujahadeen fighters combating the pro-Soviet Russia government in Kabul, aiming to induce Moscow's military intervention which followed, what Brzezinski called 'the Afghan trap.' .. Helms at CIA orchestrated Operation Phoenix in Vietnam, an assassination program claiming thousands of lives. Hillary Clinton, as junior New York Senator, supported the Hague Invasion Act. America and Israel, among other countries, failed to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. .. They remain unaccountable for the highest of high crimes. Expect Bensouda's investigation, if initiated, to accomplish nothing. Bosco admitted she'll 'be launching one of the most difficult investigations the court has undertaken, both practically and politically.' No internal or external judicial body ever tried holding America accountable for decades of Nuremberg-level high crimes.

BARRY GREY, WSWS.ORG O ne week before Election Day, with the polls tightening and the outcome uncertain, the entire US political system has been thrown into turmoil by the unprecedented intervention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The letter sent Friday to Congress by FBI Director James Comey, informing it of a new avenue of investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, has lifted the lid on a raging conflict within the state apparatus. Long-simmering tensions are exploding into open political warfare. Since Friday, various officials within the FBI and the Justice Department have let it be known that the investigation into Clinton has generated sharp divisions, with local FBI offices demanding a more aggressive investigation into Clinton's alleged mishandling of classified information as well as a separate probe into allegations of corruption involving the multi-billion-dollar Clinton Foundation. This internecine conflict intensified after Comey announced last July that the investigation into Clinton's emails was completed and no criminal charges would be brought. With his letter to Congress, Comey intervened on the side of the faction calling for more aggressive action against Clinton. Justice Department officials have let it be known that they opposed Comey's decision to make public, just 11 days before the November 8 election, the agency's review of additional emails. The Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, along with former attorneys general, Republican as well as Democratic, have bitterly denounced Comey's action. Harry Reid, the top Senate Democrat, sent a letter accusing Comey of violating the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from publicly acting in support of one or another candidate. At least one Democratic congressman has demanded that the FBI chief immediately resign. Only a few weeks ago, Clinton and the Democratic Party were indignantly denouncing Trump's charges that the election was rigged. Such charges, they claimed, were an unpatriotic slur on the pristine character of US elections and American democracy. Now, under changed circumstances, it is they who are shouting foul and accusing the FBI of trying to rig the vote against them. In fact, both factions of the ruling class have utilized the methods of scandal-mongering to fight out their battles. Over the past several months, the Democrats have centered their campaign against Trump on sex scandals and neo-McCarthyite, manufactured claims that Trump is a proxy of the Kremlin. In his letter to Comey, Reid doubled down on these charges by accusing the FBI of refusing to make public 'explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government‚Äîa foreign interest openly hostile to the United States‚Ä¶' Trump, for his part, had pointed to the pro-Clinton bias of the media, denounced the failure of the FBI to prosecute Clinton, and made thinly veiled appeals to anti-immigrant and racist sentiment by charging that Election Day would see systematic ballot-stuffing in predominantly immigrant and minority communities. In fact, the entire election is a mockery of genuine democracy. Neither of the parties can offer any policies to address the real concerns of working people. Mud-slinging and scandal-mongering are used to bury the burning issues of war, social inequality and attacks on democratic rights. The latest turn in the presidential race underscores the reactionary basis on which Clinton and the Democrats have conducted their campaign. They have sought to oppose the fascistic Trump from the right, seeking to win the support of Republican leaders and voters as well as the military/intelligence establishment by promoting Clinton's credentials as an advocate of military intervention, while declaring Trump unfit to serve as commander in chief. Their barely disguised indifference to the plight of workers and lack of support within the working class have made them highly vulnerable to the machinations of pro-Trump forces within the state. These developments have also underscored the treacherous role of Bernie Sanders. Having won mass support in the working class and among young people by portraying himself as a socialist and opponent of the 'billionaire class,' he has sought to use his influence to channel social opposition back behind the Democratic Party and the campaign of Clinton, the favored candidate of Wall Street. He has thereby played a critical role in preempting and blocking the emergence of an independent political movement of the working class. Regardless which candidate wins the election next Tuesday, nothing will be resolved in the crisis of the two-party system. Both candidates, the two most unpopular in US history, are despised by broad masses of the population, and the election result will be seen as illegitimate by a majority of the American people. A Trump victory will be seen by tens of millions of workers as a declaration of war against the working class. A Clinton win will be seen as a continuation of the reactionary status quo. Nor will the ferocious conflicts within the state recede. These are rooted objectively in a historic crisis of American and world capitalism. Economic crisis and decay, ever-widening social polarization and intensifying geopolitical conflicts have fatally eroded the foundations of bourgeois democracy. The unprecedented political crisis that has erupted in the 2016 elections is the outcome of a protracted process. The breakdown of the political system emerged in open and explosive form in the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton on the basis of a sex scandal. In an editorial titled 'Is America drifting towards civil war?' published by the World Socialist Web Site following the vote by the House of Representatives to impeach Clinton, we wrote: 'The crisis in Washington arises from an interaction of complex political, social and economic processes. Bourgeois democracy is breaking down beneath the weight of accumulated and increasingly insoluble contradictions.' That watershed event was followed by the stolen election of 2000 and the launching one year later of the 'war on terror' after the 9/11 attacks. Fifteen years of uninterrupted and ever expanding war, accompanied by a frontal attack on democratic rights and the erection of the framework of police state rule, the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression, and a further transfer of wealth to the rich have only increased the power of the military and intelligence 'deep state' and further eroded the traditional constitutional framework of capitalist rule in America. These processes have found a toxic expression in the degrading spectacle of the 2016 election. In an election dominated by the growth of social opposition and disgust with the entire political system, voters are left with the 'choice' between two corrupt, right-wing representatives of the richest 1 percent. It is crucial that the working class intervene into the political crisis as an independent force fighting for a program that addresses its needs and interests, not the drive for profit of the financial aristocracy. Short of this, the crisis of the two-party system will produce only a further lurch to the right, with more brutal attacks on working class living standards and an accelerated movement toward dictatorship and a new world war.

By BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley T he resistance to a Hillary Clinton presidency has already begun. Activists gathered in Chicago 'to strategize the fight against police violence, neoliberalism and imperialism,' all of which promise to be hallmarks of her administration. The Black Misleadership Class plays its usual, toadying role. 'The liars who said they would hold Obama's feet to the fire are repeating their empty words and hoping no one pays attention.' 'All forms of mass action must be used to deprive Clinton of support or claim of a mandate.' The Hillary Clinton administration, Slick Willie part II, will bring catastrophe unless there is constant agitation waged against it. The same woman who bragged that her party platform was progressive now brags that Republicans endorse her. The situation is urgent but there is no need to despair or to reinvent the wheel. There are groups across the country engaging in protest and they show a clear path for a liberation movement. This columnist joined with 200 activists in Chicago for the Right to Exist, Right to Resist [3] conference organized by the International League of Peoples' Struggles (ILPS USA). The Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Police Oppression, Michigan Emergency Committee Against War and Injustice, Peoples Organization for Progress, Bayan USA, Chicago Teachers Union, US Palestinian Community Network, Committee to Stop FBI Repression and others met to strategize the fight against police violence, neoliberalism and imperialism. If it is true that no person is an island then no struggle should be waged in isolation. The people of Ferguson, Missouri received support from Palestine during their rebellion against police occupation. The neoliberal onslaught that privatizes education and closes schools also deprives Flint, Michigan of clean water and its democratic rights. American imperialism threatens all life on this planet with its constant provocations against Russia and China which risk world war. 'The black 'misleaders' are silenced yet again by a prospective Democratic presidency.' Moore: A former Bernie Sanders supporter and recent 100% convert to Hillary‚Äîin the name of what? Good proof that liberals are forever blind to much of the world's realities. This presidential election repeated the sleight of hand which presents the Democrats as the party which defends us from the barbarians. Donald Trump is the foil used to fool millions of people into believing that the errand boys and girls of neoliberalism can also be the guarantors of human rights. Hillary Clinton's administration will be disastrous for black Americans in particular. The black 'misleaders' are silenced yet again by a prospective Democratic presidency. They will not speak up against Hillary Clinton any more than they did against her husband or Barack Obama. They said nothing when Bill Clinton ended the 60-year long entitlement to government benefits. They said nothing when he used the war on drugs as an excuse to lock up thousands of black people with draconian prison sentences. They said nothing when Obama wouldn't allow those people to request their freedom or when he declined to prosecute even one killer cop. They say nothing when American presidents wage wars of aggression all over the world. We can expect more going along to get along when 'two for the price of one' becomes a reality. WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO THREAD FOOLS RUSH IN . This presidential election repeated the sleight of hand which presents the Democrats as the party which defends us from the barbarians. Donald Trump is the foil used to fool millions of people into believing that the errand boys and girls of neoliberalism can also be the guarantors of human rights . Not only must activists do their utmost to fight back against the real life Lady MacBeth but they must call out those who falsely claim to be in their camp. The liars who said they would hold Obama's feet to the fire are repeating their empty words and hoping no one pays attention. They must be exposed right now and again after election day because they will surely make good on their history of appeasement. The Right to Exist, Right to Resist conference took place on the second anniversary of Laquan McDonald's murder at the hands of Chicago police. McDonald was only 17 years of age, a child according to American law. His death, the existence of the Homan Square secret prison and other instances of torture and brutality resulted in demands for community control of the police. 'She may bring the mothers of police murder victims on to the stage but she has said nothing about ending the death toll.' Chicagoans are struggling to establish an elected Civilian Police Accountability Council [4] (CPAC). Black community control of the police is a mobilizing issue all across the country. The demands began under Obama and must continue after Hillary Clinton takes office. She may bring the mothers of police murder victims on to the stage but she has said nothing about ending the death toll. That task is left for activists who know better than to expect any justice from her. Millions of Americans struggle financially and are displaced by gentrification or fear the police or want to keep their public schools open. But in 2016 they have been led astray by one of the most cynical presidential campaigns of all time. Hillary Clinton preferred Donald Trump as her rival because she was likely to lose to any other Republican. She then used the man she wanted to run against to rally otherwise skeptical voters to her side. The ego maniacal Trump performed as expected and is driving all but dead-ender right wingers to Hillary's side. There must be no celebrating when her victory is announced. That is the moment when the fights must begin in earnest. All forms of mass action must be used to deprive her of support or claim of a mandate. The champion of the ruling classes cannot be allowed to claim the progressive mantle. That title belongs to the people who met in Chicago and marched in memory of Laquan McDonald. Frederick Douglass' advice to 'Agitate, agitate, agitate,' must still be followed. If not Hillary Clinton will privatize Social Security and find a rationale to start one last disastrous war. She will be stopped only if we assert our right to exist and right to resist. Source URL: http://blackagendareport.com/organizing_in_age_of_hillary

A Black Agenda Radio Commentary by Bruce A. Dixon W hen astute political commentary from a half century ago eloquently describes the current political conundrum it means we've been stuck in a bad place for a long time. Do we really want Malcolm's observation to apply four or eight or twenty years further into the future? It's that time again, it's presidential election season, and as we hear every four years, THIS is the most important presidential election of our lives. The fact that you've heard that before should tell us something. It should us that in presidential years, many old things becomes new again, often because so much of what we're told IS new is really pretty old. Malcolm X has been dead now a half century, dead for more years than he was ever alive. But since at least one of the tricks and traps deployed to fool, frustrate and neutralize our grandparents' right to vote hasn't changed much we might want to listen carefully to what Malcolm's words in the aftermath of the 1964 presidential election. ' If Johnson had been running all by himself, he would not have been acceptable to anyone. The only thing that made him acceptable to the world was that the shrewd capitalists, the shrewd imperialists, knew that the only way people would run toward the fox would be if you showed them a wolf. So they created a ghastly alternative. And it had the whole world ‚Äî including people who call themselves Marxists ‚Äî hoping that Johnson would beat Goldwater.' Like today's Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater was a truly reprehensible and frightening figure, who had opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned racial discrimination in public accommodations, and who favored the use of nuclear weapons to defoliate the Vietnamese countryside. Also like Donald Trump, Goldwater never really stood a chance of winning the election. Goldwater the wolf was buried beneath a Johnson landslide, carrying only 6 out of the 50 states. Republican officeholders are running away from Donald Trump not because he's a racist bufoon but because he's expected to lose states Republicans are accustomed to winning. The fox, Lyndon Baines Johnson went on to start a war in Indochina that killed three million Vietnamese alone. LBJ defoliated the Vietnamese countryside with millions of tons of Agent Orange instead of nukes, causing hundreds of thousands of hideous and gruesome birth defects that continue to this day. The wolf and the fox this year are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Trump is a real estate con man, a racist and a hyper-entitled sexual predator who talks about building walls and banning Muslims. Fortunately for us all, Trump has never been in government. Hillary has scarcely ever been out of government. She's fronted for Wal-Mart, executed bloody regime change in Libya, brought US troops to Ukraine on the Russian border, and publicly itches for a showdown in Syria. Thanks to Wikileaks there is copious evidence that Hillary's public stands on a wide range of issues from charter schools to so-called trade agreements, to fracking and social security stand in stark contrast to the promises she makes to the powerful. Just as it worked 52 years ago, the overwhelming defeat of her wolvish opponent will give Hillary the appearance of a mandate. But the margin of Hillary's victory provides those of us on the left an unprecedented opportunity. It means there is no need for those who imagine themselves on the of jobs, justice, peace and the planet to ride to Hilllary's rescue and ensure the defeat of Donald Trump. Trump has already beaten himself. This election is our best chance to break out of the decades-old two party trap and build a new political force, a new political party. The Green Party is the only peace party, the only party that stands for people and planet over profit, and our only opportunity to vote our hopes, not our fears. It's time to choose. We vote Green and build Green, we can consign the political conundrum Malcolm X eloquently described a half century ago to the garbage can of history. Or we can vote for Hillary, and Malcolm's words will be as applicable four or eight years or twenty years from now as they have been for the last fifty. For Black Agenda Radio I'm Bruce Dixon.

By Gilbert Mercier } NEWS JUNKIE POST 
I f humans were largely moral and ethical beings, then globalization could be a workable proposition. Unfortunately, the dark behavioral narcissism expressed by compulsive greed and an infinite appetite for power seems to have become the guiding precept of our collective nightmare. If only the desire to dominate others and have a lot more than them were not the prime motivations for the global elite on top of the human food chain, we could all have our respective modest slice of happiness on this planet. The Utopia of globalization through institutions such as the United Nations (UN), World Bank , and International Monetary Fund (IMF) was supposed to eradicate the universal pestilence of war, extreme poverty , hunger and slavery using the might of the above supranational institutions to prevent the rise of so-called rogue nations usually ruled by dictators. 
World order of chaos with misery for profit T he opportunity of this push for a supranational form of government has to be understood in the psychological context of a world traumatized by World War II. Many public servants, who had fought against the Nazis and their Japanese and Italian allies, had genuinely the best intentions at heart when institutions like the UN were set up. If some of the original ideas were good and moral to some extend, a rot almost immediately contaminated and perverted most of the created institutions and quickly ‚Äî using the pretext of the Cold War ‚Äî allowed the birth of a monstrosity such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ). The globalists have controlled and ultimately Wall Street has financed, supranational government instances such as the UN, IMF, World Bank and a myriad of non-governmental organization (NGO) little helpers. Not only have these done nothing to curtail the man-made disasters of war, climate change , slavery and poverty, but they have exacerbated them, all for the sake of profit. I n this Orwellian time of moral decay, human misery is good for business. In a globalization controlled by Wall Street's puppeteer sociopaths, who believe they are the masters of the universe, ordinary people everywhere have become canon fodder and slave labor. They are not even collateral damage but human lubricant, as viewed by the elite. One can see that if they are not stopped immediately, trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and its Trans-Atlantic counterpart could seal the deal of the establishment of an atrocious world government, controlled by a few thousands, in complete disregard of not only national interest, but also cultural diversity. Look what happened to Detroit, Michigan, and countless other manufacturing towns in the United States that are all collateral damage of Bill Clinton's North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The massive trade agreements in the works, to be put in place by the globalists if they remain in power, are intended to annihilate any form of economic or political independence from the signatory countries and to scatter their populations to the wind, as in the case in the globalist-controlled demolition of the Middle East in Iraq, Libya and Syria. Displaced and disenfranchised populations are beaten into submission and used as docile worker bees. Drastic action or hell on earth If we let the globalists complete their worldwide coup already in progress, then all sovereignty would be lost, and most of the world's population would become slave-wage laborers at the mercy of the global corporate empire. Countries with a diversified agriculture would be turned into one-crop wastelands to ensure that most of the food supply has to be imported. Pseudo local governments would merely officiate as the slave drivers for the global elite. This must be stopped at all cost and undone by all means necessary. If we allow this final coup by the geriatric psychopaths at the top of the current world order, thousands of years of our rich human experience would be wiped out. Like poorly made cheap electronic products, the cultural garbage of the lowest common denominator empire would flood the world. This cultural homogenization would affect primarily the information available to people. Since dissent is impossible without correct information and critical thought, the globalists want their propaganda to become the only source of information. With the UN, World Bank and IMF, the political and economic framework financed by a worldwide network of banksters is already in place. Influential nations, on paper, like France and the United Kingdom, which are still officially full-fledged members of the UN Security Council, have de facto abdicated their sovereignty to become vassals and secondary enforcers of the globalist plan. We are at the edge of an existential threat of greater magnitude than ever before in human history. George Soros, Chairman Soros Fund Management answers a question during the IMF Seminar: Charting a New Growth Path for the Euro Zone on September 24, 2011 at the IMF Headquarters in Washington, DC. during the 2011 World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings. The IMF/World Bank Meetings are being held in Washington, DC this week which will host Finance Ministers and Bank Governors from 187 countries. IMF Staff Photographer/Michael Spilotro 
The semantics of deception M achiavelli is known for his cynical view of political power; however, the advice the author of The Prince gave to the powerful of his time seems innocent by comparison to the depravity of today's puppet masters. Words and ideas are gutted of their meaning to signify, most of the time, the exact opposite. For example, globalist eminence grise George Soros' Open Society Foundation is an opaque giant NGO, with more than 100 offshoots worldwide by its own admission, but its tentacles are in reality more far reaching. The recent publications of Wikileaks in the voluminous Podesta email files have been a revelation of the extent of deception victimizing United States citizens. John Podesta may be viewed as a Soros right-hand man in the US in charge of delivering the returns for the globalist's investments in the US elections. The connection between the two men is not only obvious but also official considering that Soros financed Podesta's so-called Center for American Progress, the fake left equivalent of the neocon think tanks. The term progress is a lure that signifies power, just like Soros' open society is, in reality, an exclusive club as tight as oysters reserved only for Soros' chosen associates to savor. What is apparent from the email treasure trove is that Podesta's job is really to supervise Hillary Clinton on behalf of Soros. In this context, the expression, leader of the free world, to describe the US president becomes a lie. The current world order of the globalists is anything but free, and one applicant for the job, Hillary Clinton, is not a queen on the chessboard, but a pawn.
Axis of resistance: Russia, China and Iran and lessons from Haiti's revolution Aung Stoong, 53, harvests grass to feed the cows and buffalo. Aung Stoong, 53, binds grass into 180k.g. bales in rural Myanmar. All the animal fodder is cut by hand and Aung Stoong harvests up to 800 k.g. of grass by hand each day. O ne could ask: isn't this psychopathic globalist coup of financiers well on its way? Isn't it a done deal, and how can we resist and salvage anything? The examples of Russia, China and Iran prove that, as national entities, we still can. Germany, Japan and South Korea could reclaim their independence and kick out their US occupation. France and the UK could stop being submissive nations and get out of NATO. That would be a start. The path of war rhetoric expressed by the globalist mouthpieces of the West against Russia, Iran and, to a lesser extent, China has to do with the national resistance of these three countries. The citizenry of Europe and North America should understand, that if such unprecedented conflicts occur, all countries will be on the front line, and there is more than enough fire power on each side to ensure massive destruction and no winning side. Russia, China and Iran are the last national obstacles to the globalist coup, and perhaps we are heading back to a bipolar two-block world order similar to the Cold War era. Other options, including the dismantlement, or at least the curtailment, of supranational organizations such as the UN, World Bank and IMF would surely be the side effects of what appears to be in many countries a revival of nationalism. The final plan of the globalists would be atrocious for all of us. Waving the white flag is not an option. At this critical time of our history, and before our collective enslavement, we should all emulate the brave Haitian slaves who beat not one, but three empires 212 years ago. Haitians were only the last ones to prove that it can be done; it must be redone.

ARTICLE

By BAR executive editor Glen Ford A n architect of regime-change, coups, no-fly zones, rule of the rich and mass incarceration is about to become Commander-in-Chief, yet the bulk of what passes for the Left is 'engaged in a 1930s-style 'united front' against a 'fascism' that was never a threat in 21st century America.' Donald Trump, the orange menace, didn't have a chance of becoming president. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is a 21st century fascist and threat to life on Earth. 'Trump's anti-'free trade' stance and opposition to regime change and military confrontation with Russia and China drove most of the Republican-allied section of the ruling class straight into Hillary Clinton's imperial Big Tent.' Hillary Clinton's impending ‚Äî and totally predictable ‚Äî landslide victory on November 8 will prove only that there never was any danger of a 'fascist' white nationalist takeover of the U.S. executive branch of government in 2016. That was always a red (or 'orange') herring, a phony 'barbarians at the gate' threat that ‚Äî as Wikileaks documents [3] confirmed ‚Äî John Podesta and Hillary's other handlers fervently hoped would convey 'lesser evil' status to their manifestly unpopular candidate. There was nothing particularly devious or out of the ordinary in the Hillary camp's favoring Donald Trump or, alternatively, Ted Cruz. It is standard Democratic Party practice to position themselves just to the left of the Republicans. In a duopoly electoral system, victory lies in where the cake is cut. By hugging close to the GOP's flanks, national Democratic candidates can lay claim to a 'center-left' spectrum of political space that encompasses a clear majority of U.S. public opinion on most issues. By this calculus, Democrats are supposed to win, unless they are tripped up on the closely related issues of race (failure to 'stand up' to the Blacks) and foreign policy (failure to 'stand up' to whoever is the designated foreign enemy). There was nothing particularly devious or out of the ordinary in the Hillary camp's favoring Donald Trump or, alternatively, Ted Cruz. It is standard Democratic Party practice to position themselves just to the left of the Republicans. In a duopoly electoral system, victory lies in where the cake is cut. Race is the trickiest part of the equation, since white supremacy is embedded in the American political conversation, hiding just beneath the surface of most discourse on social and economic policy. 'His overt racism probably weakened his appeal to whites.' Trump thought he could win by combining an overt white racist appeal with an anti-corporate message that laid the blame on Wall Street for (white) American job losses and falling living standards. He also calculated ‚Äî correctly, it turns out ‚Äî that in the wake of the 2008 economic meltdown, many white Americans were more upset about their own economic and social status than they were angry at Russians; that they wanted regime change at home more than abroad. Both of Trump's central policies backfired, dooming his campaign. His overt racism probably weakened his appeal to whites, who have given majorities to national Republicans since 1968 but whose self-image is that they are not, as individuals, racist. (Certainly, white women found further reason to reject his candidacy.) Much more spectacularly, Trump's anti-'free trade' stance and opposition to regime change and military confrontation with Russia and China drove most of the Republican-allied section of the ruling class straight into Hillary Clinton's imperial Big Tent. At the national level, the duopoly system, as we had known it, virtually ceased to exist ‚Äì a fact dramatically driven home by the near-universal corporate media rejection of Donald Trump, the candidacy they had done so much to create. The near-collapse of the duopoly system was the great fracture of the 2016 election, a potential historic opening to a far wider space of progressive political struggle, including on the moribund electoral level. With the ruling class gathered in one Big Tent, and the overt racists occupying the imploded shell of the GOP, the system itself was in disarray. What was once two vibrant parties of the ruling class, with a virtual monopoly on the totality of the electorate, had become one ruling class party plus a hollowed-out husk, at least temporarily occupied by white nationalists under the leadership of a narcissistic and incoherent billionaire, yet without enough funds to mount a competitive general election campaign. 'The near-collapse of the duopoly system was the great fracture of the 2016 election.' I n these pages, we had been saying since last year that Donald Trump could not win; that Bernie Sanders' fate would be sealed in the southern primaries; and that, although ruling class money would insure Clinton an election by landslide, it could not buy her legitimacy among a significant section of the Democratic 'base,' who would now be pushed to the latrine area of her Big Tent. As we wrote on May 18 [4] of this year: 'Outsized fear of Trump is hysteria. These days, the 'brown shirts' wear blue. Hillary is the candidate of Wall Street, War and Austerity ‚Äì not Trump, the racist America Firster. And, he can't win, anyway ‚Äì not with tens of millions of 'moderate' Republicans and most of the party's funders rushing into Hillary's welcoming embrace.' But sadly, hysteria does reign in most of the 'left' precincts of America. Those who did not hesitate to kick Hillary when she appeared to be 'down' ‚Äî in those heady days when they imagined it was possible she could lose to Sanders ‚Äî are terrified to kick her when she is 'up' and primed to take the helm of the hyper-power. They are engaged in a 1930s-style 'united front' against a 'fascism' that was never a threat in 21 st century America, where a different kind of dictatorship of the rich (but also a fascism) has made brown-shirts (and Klansmen) utterly superfluous. These trembling leftists refuse to oppose the modern manifestation of fascism, which is now firmly entrenched in power with Hillary as its champion, in favor of a crusade against an 'orange' menace that did not have a ghost of a chance of seizing national power. They have made themselves perfectly irrelevant and useless ‚Äî except, of course, to the fascists-in-charge. Source URL: http://blackagendareport.com/ghost_fascists_vs_real_ones

patrick martin & barry grey, wsws.org Political warfare explodes in Washington 31 October 2016 J ust a week before Election Day, the crisis gripping the American ruling class and its state, marked by intractable and bitter internal conflicts, has erupted into open political warfare. Last Friday's letter from Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey to Congress announcing new 'investigative steps' in the probe of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, itself a manifestation of the crisis, has brought the underlying tensions to the boiling point. It has exposed raging conflicts within the FBI and, more broadly, the national security apparatus as a whole. Comey's cryptic letter acknowledged that the FBI has not actually reviewed a new batch of emails that 'appear to be pertinent' to its previous investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server for official business while she was secretary of state. The agency, he wrote, 'cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant.' This astonishing admission makes all the more extraordinary Comey's decision to make the discovery of the new emails a public issue only eleven days before the election. In a rapid-fire series of developments this weekend, Justice Department officials revealed that they had opposed Comey's decision to send the letter, arguing that it violated a longstanding principle that no Justice Department or FBI action that might impact on a candidate should be announced within 60 days of an election. The Clinton campaign and congressional Democrats lashed out at Comey for the timing of the letter. At a campaign rally in Daytona Beach, Florida, Clinton said Comey's action is 'not just strange, it's unprecedented.' She also tweeted that 'FBI Director Comey bowed to partisan pressure,' suggesting that the letter was an effort to appease congressional Republican leaders opposed to Comey's determination last July that there was no basis for criminal charges against Clinton over her use of a private email server. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid sent a letter to Comey suggesting that he had violated the law forbidding government employees to use their official positions to influence the result of an election. 'I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act,' he wrote. 'Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.' He added that Comey had 'demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be clear intent to aid one political party over another,' because he had made public the renewed FBI interest in Clinton's emails, but was silent on what Reid called 'explosive information' supposedly connecting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to Russian government officials. Here Reid was resorting to the Russia-baiting that has been the Clinton campaign's main response to the publication by WikiLeaks of tens of thousands of emails and other documents sent or received by campaign chairman John Podesta, including devastating information on Bill Clinton's use of the Clinton Foundation to obtain lucrative speaking engagements with corporations and business associations. Campaign spokesmen have refused to discuss the contents of the emails, claiming that they were hacked by Russian government agents and then handed over to WikiLeaks to damage Clinton and help Trump. NBC News reported Sunday that the FBI has now obtained a search warrant to go through all 650,000 emails found on the laptop of former congressman Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton's closest aide, Huma Abedin. Weiner is under FBI investigation for allegedly sending sexually explicit text messages to an underage girl. The Wall Street Journal gave details, in a story posted on its web site Sunday afternoon, of the explosive internal crisis within the FBI that led to Comey's letter to Congress. By this account, there has been a fierce battle within the FBI and between the FBI and the Justice Department not only over the Clinton email investigation, but over separate investigations involving four FBI field offices (New York, Washington DC, Los Angeles and Little Rock, Arkansas) into the operations of the Clinton Foundation. AG Lynch: A Democrat apparatchik like the rest of the top tier of the Democratic party mafia, and typical of the Black misleaders that ice African American radicalism in a conflicted age. More than eight months ago, FBI agents presented plans for a more aggressive investigation of the foundation to career prosecutors in the Justice Department, only to have the proposal blocked on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence. The FBI offices nonetheless continued their investigations, which were intensified after the Clinton email investigation was wound up in July. The Journal report suggests that either a substantial faction within the FBI was convinced that top FBI officials were covering up criminal activities on the part of Hillary and Bill Clinton, or the FBI dissidents were politically motivated to use agency resources to undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, or both. When top officials in the FBI and Justice Department opposed these efforts, open rebellion followed, expressed in leaks to the Wall Street Journal centrally targeting FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for state senate in Virginia last year. According to some press reports, Comey sent his letter to Congress last week because he was convinced the information would become public anyway through further leaks by FBI subordinates. The open warfare engulfing Washington on the eve of a presidential election reveals that the entire political system and the state apparatus itself are riven by tensions and conflicts so deep and bitter that they cannot be contained within the traditional framework of bourgeois elections. Fueling these tensions is the convergence of crises on the economic, geopolitical, internal political and social fronts. The US and world economy remain mired in stagnation more than eight years after the 2008 Wall Street crash, and there are growing fears that central bank policies designed to buttress the banks and drive up stock prices are leading to a new financial disaster. The economic crisis is fueling social anger and alienation from the entire political system, as reflected in different ways in the mass support for the anti-Wall Street campaign of the self-styled 'socialist' Bernie Sanders and the 'America first' pseudo-populist campaign of Donald Trump. Twenty-five years of unending war and fifteen years of the 'war on terror' have failed to secure US hegemony in the Middle East and only heightened fears within the ruling elite that US imperialism is losing ground to rivals such as Russia and China. The disarray of US policy in Syria, in particular, has led to bitter conflicts and recriminations over US policy, and demands for a major escalation of military violence, not only in Syria, but throughout the Middle East. These are combined with calls for a more aggressive confrontation with Russia and China. The great danger is that these conflicts are being fought out behind the backs of the working class by different factions of the same reactionary ruling class. Unless the working class intervenes as an independent political and revolutionary force, fighting for its own interests in opposition to all parties and factions of the capitalist class, the crisis will inevitably result in ever more right-wing policies at home and ever wider wars abroad, leading inexorably to a new world war. The capitalist two-party system offers only two reactionary alternatives: the fascistic billionaire Trump, who demands a vast increase in military spending and authoritarian methods of rule, and the multimillionaire Clinton, the favorite of Wall Street and the military-intelligence apparatus, who would continue and escalate the right-wing policies of the Obama administration. All factions of the ruling elite agree on concealing the implications of the world capitalist crisis from working people. Hence the degraded character of the bourgeois election campaign, with any serious discussion of the social crisis and the war danger drowned out by media sensationalism over a succession of sex scandals and anti-Russian propaganda. The Socialist Equality Party entered the 2016 elections to prepare the working class for the political convulsions that have already begun, even before the ballots are counted on Election Day. Our candidates, Jerry White for president and Niles Niemuth for vice president, have consistently warned that the capitalist campaigns are aimed at concealing the crisis and disarming working people. The SEP election campaign is not fundamentally about votes, but about building a political leadership in the working class for the great struggles to come. ‚ÄîPatrick Martin and Barry Grey The FBI intervenes in the 2016 election 
Dateline: 29 October 2016 
I n an extraordinary and unprecedented action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has stepped into the 2016 presidential campaign only 11 days before Election Day, sending a letter to Congress announcing new 'investigative steps' related to Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. 
The three-paragraph letter by FBI Director James Comey to eight congressional committees on Friday is remarkably vague. It states that 'in connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation' of Clinton's personal email server, which, Comey notes, he had previously told Congress was 'completed.' 
He states that he has agreed to 'allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.' He acknowledges that the FBI 'cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant.' 
The obvious question that arises is why, given the fact that the FBI has no idea whether these additional emails contain any significant information relative to the Clinton email case, the agency should make them a public issue within days of the election. Media commentators noted that the letter violates a longstanding informal FBI ban on making politically sensitive announcements within 60 days of a US election. 
Following the report of Comey's letter, the news media, citing unnamed federal law enforcement officials, said the emails in question were found on a laptop computer shared by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband, former Representative Anthony Weiner. 
Weiner is under FBI investigation for allegedly sending sexually explicit text messages to an underage girl. Abedin announced her separation from Weiner earlier this year after the latest episode involving Weiner and sexually explicit Internet activity became public. 
Comey's letter was hailed by Donald Trump and Republican Party spokesmen as tantamount to an official reopening of the FBI investigation and rescinding of the decision announced by Comey in July that no charges would be brought against the Democratic presidential candidate. 
Clinton spoke to the press briefly Friday evening, demanding that the FBI provide more information about the substance of what it was reviewing, including whether there was any connection to her use of a private email server. She pointed out that more than 15 million people have already voted and that many millions more will be going to the polls over the next week as early voting continues. In response to questions, she indicated that the FBI has not contacted her and that she first learned of the letter through the media. 
It is at this point impossible to determine with precision the motivation behind Comey's letter and the political forces for which he is speaking. However, his attempt to present the letter as a politically disinterested response to the discovery of new information lacks any credibility. 
This direct intervention into the election by the top police-intelligence agency can only be an expression of deep crisis and profound tensions within the American ruling class and the state. The election as a whole has been dominated by the growth of social anger and antiestablishment sentiment, yet it has ended in a contest between two right-wing representatives of the richest 1 percent who are despised by huge sections of the electorate. 
It has plumbed the depths of political debasement on the part of both candidates‚Äîthe fascistic billionaire Trump seeking to channel discontent along the most right-wing, chauvinist and racist channels; the multimillionaire Clinton relying on sex scandals and a McCarthyite attack on Trump as an agent of Russian President Vladimir Putin to bury incriminating revelations of corruption and lying and to swing public opinion behind a policy of military escalation and confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. 
The entire process has been surrounded by an aura of violence and a breakdown of public confidence in the political system. It has unfolded under conditions of deepening economic crisis, mounting international tensions and worsening crises for US imperialism around the world, i.e., the ongoing debacle of Washington's war for regime change in Syria, the signs of disarray in the anti-Chinese 'pivot to Asia,' the emergence of open conflicts with imperialist 'allies' in Europe, particularly Germany. 
The convergence of these crises is generating bitter conflicts within the American ruling class over policy questions, magnified by fears of a rising tide of social opposition at home. 
Whether the intention of Comey's letter was to inflict fatal damage to Clinton's candidacy, shore up endangered Republican majorities in the Senate and House, or fire a shot across the bow against an incoming Clinton administration, it makes clear that the next administration will be mired in crisis from the day it takes office.[if gte mso 9]><xml><w:WordDocument><w:View>Normal</w:View><w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom><w:PunctuationKerning/><w:ValidateAgainstSchemas/><w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>false</w:SaveIfXMLInvalid><w:IgnoreMixedContent>false</w:IgnoreMixedContent><w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>false</w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText><w:Compatibility><w:BreakWrappedTables/><w:SnapToGridInCell/><w:WrapTextWithPunct/><w:UseAsianBreakRules/><w:DontGrowAutofit/></w:Compatibility><w:BrowserLevel>MicrosoftInternetExplorer4</w:BrowserLevel></w:WordDocument></xml><![endif][if gte mso 9]><xml><w:LatentStyles DefLockedState='false' LatentStyleCount='156‚Ä≥></w:LatentStyles></xml><![endif][if gte mso 10]><style> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:'Table Normal'; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:''; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language:#0400; mso-fareast-language:#0400; mso-bidi-language:#0400;} </style><![endif][if gte mso 9]><xml><o:shapedefaults v:ext='edit' spidmax='1026‚Ä≥/></xml><![endif][if gte mso 9]><xml><o:shapelayout v:ext='edit'><o:idmap v:ext='edit' data='1‚Ä≥/></o:shapelayout></xml><![endif] 
One former Justice Department official suggested that Comey was under intense pressure from within the FBI over his previous declaration that no competent prosecutor would bring charges against Clinton over her use of the private server. If true, this means that sections of the federal police agency are in open revolt against the candidate who may shortly become their nominal 'commander-in-chief.' 
The FBI intervention on the eve of the 2016 election represents an acceleration of a trend in US politics that first came to the surface in the series of Republican-led investigations into the Bill Clinton administration, culminating in his impeachment in 1998. This was followed by the stolen election of 2000, when the Supreme Court intervened and by a 5-4 majority halted the recounting of ballots in Florida in order to award the White House to George W. Bush, the loser in the popular vote. 
The two-party system in the United States has always been an instrument of class rule, dominated by corporate America. The unprecedented growth of social inequality over the past four decades has widened the gulf between the political system and the great majority of the population. More and more, official political life revolves around palace intrigues, in which the media and the military-intelligence apparatus play critical roles. The methods of scandalmongering, calculated leaks and political stink bombs prevail. 
One thing is clear: none of these strokes and counterstrokes between rival capitalist factions has anything to do with defending the democratic rights and social interests of working people. As far as the capitalist two-party system is concerned, the American people are merely an object of manipulation, to be stampeded by demagogy and scandal.

DISPATCHES FROM DANIEL ESPINOSA working to defeat the Big Lie in all its forms 
J ulian Assange has taken from the political elites their de facto right to conceal their actions from the public they claim to serve. But if we can learn anything from WikiLeaks is that a veil of secrecy many times concealS self-interest taken to a criminal degree. 
Many journalists and researchers have shown us in the past that political and business elites prefer not to discuss policy with the rabble . Even as elections are many times represented as a rather weak (or limited) form of democracy, political elites demand to control them nonetheless. Quoting Hillary Clinton addressing the Israeli press in 2006: 
'I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win'. (1) 
Nothing out of the ordinary for the already notorious Democrat behind the infamous 'we came, we saw, he died', referring to Gaddafi's murder, or 'can¬¥t we just drone this guy?', referring to Assange. American propaganda is not only pervasive but utterly false and hypocritical, mostly based on manufactured fears. 
For some politicians, democracy, or a fair trial, is not for everyone. This disdain for democratic values is deeply rooted in Western societies, as Noam Chomsky and Michael Parenti, to mention just two noted scholars, have extensively covered throughout their work, even figures as central to modern liberal journalism as Walter Lippmann regarded the masses as 'ignorant and meddlesome outsiders', meaning regular citizens should be 'spectators', not 'participants', whose only duty is to show up every couple of years to ratify decisions made elsewhere. 
If information empowers, WikiLeaks should be recognized as a democratic tool, redistributing power in times when it is obscenely concentrated. This is extremely disturbing for the subservient corporate media, as we can easily observe in the reaction of many of its [putative] journalists: 
'Bravo, Ecuador. This isn't about silencing Assange and suppressing his operation. It's about preventing the Ecuadorean embassy from doubling as headquarters for a Putin-Assange campaign to discredit Clinton' . (A Chicago Tribune editorial celebrating Ecuador's President Correa cutting off Assange's internet, 10/19/16). T he negative association of Putin with Trump has been helpful in condemning Assange, who by himself is often considered a positive influence in Western politics (especially when attacking the Republican Party). The fabrication of a plan between Russia and WikiLeaks to influence American elections is, of course, not only patently ludicrous given the advanced state of putrefaction of American democracy itself, hardly a damsel whose virtue is in peril, never as exemplary as propagandists would have us believe, but simply an excuse for pseudo journalists and the punditocracy to ignore the contents of the leaks and drive the public's attention toward Putin and Russia, as in those golden days when many things could be associated with the 'Red Scare'. 
Thus, as they speculate about how deep Putin's nose is inserted in US politics and all the similarities between him and past mythological demons threatening America, these characters look away from the reality of the decomposing political system they still cling to. 
Their task has been made simpler by the obnoxious nature of Clinton's adversary. With his racist and misogynistic rhetoric, Trump stands as the easy-to-hate billionaire/villain, and yet he isn't pushing for a no-fly zone over Syria, an innocent sounding notion that could easily escalate into something truly catastrophic. B ut corporate media, being a tool of the corporate ruling class which also controls the military and all major banking and commercial entities in the nation and around the globe, rarely speak against military intervention, especially when framed as 'humanitarian', the latest p.r. label concocted by the spin doctors to disguise naked imperial aggression.
Going to war, expanding imperial domains and influence, promoting Wall Street interests, all that while selling the narrative of the 'enemies of freedom' is exactly what the American establishment demands of its presidents. As an extension of those interests, corporate media‚Äîas previously noted‚Äîalso demands to be the sole apparatus in charge of shaping public opinion in the direction of which candidates to choose from, and what qualities such people should exhibit . Unsurprisingly, transmitting a truthful portrait of Hillary Clinton is off-limits, as it would seriously question her political legitimacy. 
This explains ridiculous claims as that from CNN host Chris Cuomo in regard to Wikileaks, stating that, '‚Ä¶remember, it's illegal to possess these stolen documents. It's different for the media. So everything you learn about this, you're learning from us'. WikiLeaks has in fact managed to redirect some attention to HRC's longstanding dirty ways to do politics, with its known costs to third world 'regimes' and overall peace, as well as her predilection for Wall Street sponsors. Trump does not necessarily represent anything substantively different, but the illusion of choice is fundamental in our capitalist democracies. As former UK Ambassador turned human rights activist Craig Murray puts it: 'You will not get a clear analysis of these issues from the mainstream media. That is because they are of course part of the money/power nexus in which Clinton is intimately connected, and they expect Clinton to win. I think their fear of Trump is exaggerated. He and Clinton are two plutocrat candidates in a system laughingly labelled democracy. They move in the same social and financial circles'. (2) That may explain the haste by some media to celebrate Rafael Correa for unplugging Assange's internet connection recently, a mere gesture that 'does not prevent the WikiLeaks organization from carrying out its journalistic activities', as the Ecuadorian government emphasized. 
This attitude towards Assange and WikiLeaks is shared by international media, with Ecuador's press also expressing frustration and suggesting the inconvenience of standing against the American political establishment. 
Examples of this subservient spirit abound in the media: '‚Ä¶unless the Ecuadorian government is voluntarily inserting itself in this global chessboard that has inflamed the conflict between US and Russia, and threatens [to] seriously distort US elections, letting Assange continue with his plan is going to sink Ecuadorian foreign policy‚Ä¶ it's ‚Äìliterally- a diplomatic suicide' . (3) 
Standing against the de facto powers of the Western world is sure to provoke this kind of reaction, but the real distortion of US elections came before (way before) WikiLeaks, that's exactly one of the many functions of corporate media: to misrepresent its profoundly worthless and highly compromised leaders for easier public consumption. 
What Ecuador is doing is protecting a very important source of information that is reminding the world about the importance of political transparency, as it would (presumably) do with any journalist living inside its territory.

shorty THE DUOPOLY WATCH | Steven Jonas, MD, MPH Special to The Greanville Post | Commentary No. 63: 'The Cometization of the 2016 Elections: The Role of the Ruling Class ' O n July 5, 2016, The Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, James Comey, shooting like a comet over Washington, D.C., announced that after an extensive investigation, no criminal charges relating to the improper use/protection/transmission of classified documents would be brought against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. At the same time, he launched into an extensive negative analysis of what had been done with emails, sensitive or not, on State Department or private servers, by Mrs. Clinton and members of her staff. That statement, very unusual for an FBI Director to make, had a transitory effect on Clinton's poll numbers. But at the same time, the Director, in a highly unusual action, little noticed at the time, told leading Republican on the House Intelligence Committee that it would keep them informed of any further developments. As is well-known, just now there have been further developments. Mr. Comey announced publicly that there would be a further investigation of (possible) Clinton emails. He made this announcement before any investigation had begun, much less concluded and before his agents had obtained even so much as a warrant for seizing a lap-top belonging to the estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, of one of Mrs. Clinton's closest aides, Huma Abedin. This action by Comey was considered to be highly unusual, to say the least, by a variety of sources/authorities, including, for example, The New York Times editorial page . It was even unclear as to whether, after some kind of preliminary evaluation, the previous formal inquiry would be reopened. The U.S. Justice Department strongly discouraged Comey from making such an speculative announcement (as in 'their might be a further investigation after we've had a look at Mr. Weiner server which ‚Äî who knows ‚Äî might simply be filled with photos of Mr. Weiner's private parts taken from a wide variety of angles'). It appeared as if Mr. Comey himself might be violating the law, that is the 1939 Hatch Act , which prohibits government employees from taking actions close to elections which might influence their outcomes. A Republican, Richard Painter, who worked as the Chief Ethics Officer in the Bush White House (and a Clinton supporter this time around), went so far as to file a formal ethics complaint against Comey, for apparent violation of the Hatch Act (which would be a criminal offense). There have been a variety of political outcomes from the Comey action, ranging from no change in the Clinton/Trump poll numbers to significant changes in them, from no change in the generally predicted Clinton lock on the Electoral College vote to possibly enough of a Trump swing in the swing states to give the election to him. Most observers are not attributing ulterior motives to Mr. Comey. 'He made a simple mistake.' 'He was trying to be open about what is going on, but he was premature in making such an announcement ‚Äî poor judgement.' 'He was under pressure from Congressional Republicans. Suppose that he had not announced the further investigation [of a bunch of emails that might not even be Clinton's] in advance of its being undertaken, and then something had come of it after the election? Boy, would they be mad [or worse].' Well, folks, I don't buy any of it. I think that what Comey did, from the July 'even though we have nothing criminal on you you're a bad girl' speech to the present 'we are announcing that an investigation will be starting [once we get a warrant], without any idea that anything further that might be incriminating might be found' is all part of a plan. (And yes, this is a conspiracy hypothesis, but not quite the kind that Alex Jones would come up with.) In 2013 Mr. Comey was given the customary ten-year term appointment as FBI Director by President Barack Obama. (Wonder why in all of this bruhaha from the Democrats Obama gave him a vote of confidence?) A career Federal prosecutor and occasional corporate lawyer who eventually became Deputy Attorney General under Bush , he is a Republican. He has had a reputation for highly ethical behavior. He does not live in a bubble, however. He had to have known that what he was doing when he gave his totally unnecessary speech when he announced 'no criminal findings' in the original Clinton emails/server case. While it did not seem to have any long-term political effects, it did stir the political pot at the time. This announcement has the pot boiling. It could swing the election to Trump. Although the conventional wisdom as of Nov. 1, when this column is being written, is that it won't, because of Clinton's heavy advantage in the Electoral College, Glenn Beck, an arch-reactionary who happens to be anti-Trump, thinks that Comey's announcement is 'one of the most irresponsible things to ever happen' and could swing the election to Trump. And although unlikely, it could. So how did this happen? Well, Comet Comey has a phone (you can sure that the doesn't do political stuff by email), and it is as secure a one as can be found. As I have pointed out previously, there is an increasingly large sector of the ruling class, led by some very wealthy hedge fund managers like the one who came to the Trump campaign along with Steve Bannon (from the Cruz campaign). They REALLY want Trump to win: further huge tax cuts for the wealthy and the end of regulation as we know it. My guess is that they got to Comey. What they offered or promised him, if anything at all, is impossible to know. But I do believe that that is what happened. Comey is a long-time Federal lawyer. He is now the Director of the FBI. He had to know about the Hatch Act, and that he would be violating it. He also knows that regardless of the outcome of the election he is never going to be prosecuted for doing so. Until last Friday, Trump was sinking and a number of down-ticket Republicans were going with him. Now, as the result of the 'announcement' of something that might or might not happen, Trump is making huge hay of it and could win, and even more importantly the Republicans have a much better chance of holding on to the Senate. This did not happen by accident. An unprecedented announcement in October goes back to an unprecedented speech in July. Unprecedented once? Well, maybe by happenstance. Unprecedented twice? Well, not so much. Postscript: According to the FBI, there is no direct connection between Donald Trump and the Russian Government/business sector. According to a long-time counter-intelligence operative of another country, there are numerous documents showing just such relationships and he gave them to the FBI . Here's one excerpt: ' Mother Jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote. The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer's conversations with Russian sources, noted, 'Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.' It maintained that Trump 'and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.' It claimed that Russian intelligence had 'compromised' Trump during his visits to Moscow and could 'blackmail him.' ' This is stuff for an actual investigation. Is there any evidence that one is underway? Well, it would be improper for the FBI to comment on investigations that are still in process (only on those that have not yet begun). But the media are not letting go on this one . Do stay tuned (and remember, I wrote this on November 1).

shorty BY MIKE WHITNEY 'Nation state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state.' ‚Äî Zbigniew Brzezinski, 'Between Two Ages: The Technetronic Era', 1971 'I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria‚Ä¶.not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians.' ‚Äî Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Third Presidential Debate W hy is Hillary Clinton so eager to intensify US involvement in Syria when US interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya have all gone so terribly wrong? The answer to this question is simple. It's because Clinton doesn't think that these interventions went wrong. And neither do any of the other members of the US foreign policy establishment. (aka‚ÄìThe Borg). In fact, in their eyes these wars have been a rousing success. Sure, a few have been critical of the public relations backlash from the nonexistent WMD in Iraq, (or the logistical errors, like disbanding the Iraqi Army) but‚Äìfor the most part‚Äì the foreign policy establishment is satisfied with its efforts to destabilize the region and remove leaders that refuse to follow Washington's diktats. This is hard for ordinary people to understand. They can't grasp why elite powerbrokers would want to transform functioning, stable countries into uninhabitable wastelands overrun by armed extremists, sectarian death squads and foreign-born terrorists. Nor can they understand what has been gained by Washington's 15 year-long rampage across the Middle East and Central Asia that has turned a vast swathe of strategic territory into a terrorist breeding grounds? What is the purpose of all this? First, we have to acknowledge that the decimation and de facto balkanization of these countries is part of a plan. If it wasn't part of a plan, than the decision-makers would change the policy. But they haven't changed the policy. The policy is the same. The fact that the US is using foreign-born jihadists to pursue regime change in Syria as opposed to US troops in Iraq, is not a fundamental change in the policy. The ultimate goal is still the decimation of the state and the elimination of the existing government. This same rule applies to Libya and Afghanistan both of which have been plunged into chaos by Washington's actions. But why? What is gained by destroying these countries and generating so much suffering and death? Here's what I think: I think Washington is involved in a grand project to remake the world in a way that better meets the needs of its elite constituents, the international banks and multinational corporations. Brzezinski not only refers to this in the opening quote, he also explains what is taking place: The nation-state is being jettisoned as the foundation upon which the global order rests. Instead, Washington is erasing borders, liquidating states, and removing strong, secular leaders that can mount resistance to its machinations in order to impose an entirely new model on the region, a new world order. The people who run these elite institutions want to create an interconnected-global free trade zone overseen by the proconsuls of Big Capital, in other words, a global Eurozone that precludes the required state institutions (like a centralized treasury, mutual debt, federal transfers) that would allow the borderless entity to function properly. Deep state powerbrokers who set policy behind the smokescreen of our bought-and-paid-for congress think that one world government is an achievable goal provided they control the world's energy supplies, the world's reserve currency and become the dominant player in this century's most populous and prosperous region, Asia. This is essentially what Hillary's 'pivot' to Asia is all about. The basic problem with Washington's NWO plan is that a growing number of powerful countries are still attached to the old world order and are now prepared to defend it. This is what's really going on in Syria, the improbable alliance of Russia, Syria, Iran and Hezbollah have stopped the US military juggernaut dead in its tracks. The unstoppable force has hit the immovable object and the immovable object has prevailed‚Ä¶so far. Naturally, the foreign policy establishment is upset about these new developments, and for good reason. The US has run the world for quite a while now, so the rolling back of US policy in Syria is as much a surprise as it is a threat. The Russian Airforce deployed to Syria a full year ago in September, but only recently has Washington shown that it's prepared to respond by increasing its support of its jihadists agents on the ground and by mounting an attack on ISIS in the eastern part of the country, Raqqa. But the real escalation is expected to take place when Hillary Clinton becomes president in 2017. That's when the US will directly engage Russia militarily, assuming that their tit-for-tat encounters will be contained within Syria's borders. It's a risky plan, but it's the next logical step in this bloody fiasco. Neither party wants a nuclear war, but Washington believes that doing nothing is tantamount to backing down, therefore, Hillary and her neocon advisors can be counted on to up the ante. 'No-fly zone', anyone? The assumption is that eventually, and with enough pressure, Putin will throw in the towel. But this is another miscalculation. Putin is not in Syria because he wants to be nor is he there because he values his friendship with Syrian President Bashar al Assad. That's not it at all. Putin is in Syria because he has no choice. Russia's national security is at stake. If Washington's strategy of deploying terrorists to topple Assad succeeds, then the same ploy will be attempted in Iran and Russia. Putin knows this, just like he knows that the scourge of foreign-backed terrorism can decimate entire regions like Chechnya. He knows that it's better for him to kill these extremists in Aleppo than it will be in Moscow. So he can't back down, that's not an option. But, by the same token, he can compromise, in other words, his goals and the goals of Assad do not perfectly coincide. For example, he could very well make territorial concessions to the US for the sake of peace that Assad might not support. But why would he do that? Why wouldn't he continue to fight until every inch of Syria's sovereign territory is recovered? Because it's not in Russia's national interest to do so, that's why. Putin has never tried to conceal the fact that he's in Syria to protect Russia's national security. That's his main objective. But he's not an idealist, he's a pragmatist who'll do whatever he has to to end the war ASAP. That means compromise. This doesn't matter to the Washington warlords‚Ä¶.yet. But it will eventually. Eventually there will be an accommodation of some sort. No one is going to get everything they want, that much is certain. For example, it's impossible to imagine that Putin would launch a war on Turkey to recover the territory that Turkish troops now occupy in N Syria. In fact, Putin may have already conceded as much to Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan in their recent meetings. But that doesn't mean that Putin doesn't have his red lines. He does. Aleppo is a red line. Turkish troops will not be allowed to enter Aleppo. The western corridor, the industrial and population centers are all red lines. On these, there will be no compromise. Putin will help Assad remain in power and keep the country largely intact. But will Turkey control sections in the north, and will the US control sections in the east? Probably. This will have to be worked out in negotiations, but its unlikely that the country's borders will be the same as they were before the war broke out. Putin will undoubtedly settle for a halfloaf provided the fighting ends and security is restored. In any event, he's not going to hang around until the last dog is hung. Unfortunately, we're a long way from any settlement in Syria, mainly because Washington is nowhere near accepting the fact that its project to rule the world has been derailed. That's the crux of the matter, isn't it? The bigshots who run the country are still in denial. It hasn't sunk in yet that the war is lost and that their nutty jihadist-militia plan has failed. It's going to take a long time before Washington gets the message that the world is no longer its oyster. The sooner they figure it out, the better it'll be for everyone.

Where to Invade Next Official Trailer 1 (2016) ‚Äì Michael Moore Documentary HD M ichael Moore has made some terrific movies in the past, and Where to Invade Next may be the best of them, but I expected Trumpland to be (1) about Trump, (2) funny, (3) honest, (4) at least relatively free of jokes glorifying mass murder. I was wrong on all counts and would like my $4.99 back, Michael. Moore's new movie is a film of him doing a stand-up comedy show about how wonderfully awesome Hillary Clinton is ‚Äî except that he mentions Trump a bit at the beginning and he's dead serious about Clinton being wonderfully awesome. This film is a text book illustration of why rational arguments for lesser evilist voting do not work. Lesser evilists become self-delusionists. They identify with their lesser evil candidate and delude themselves into adoring the person. Moore is not pushing the 'Elect her and then hold her accountable' stuff. He says we have a responsibility to 'support her' and 'get behind her,' and that if after two years ‚Äî yes, TWO YEARS ‚Äî she hasn't lived up to a platform he's fantasized for her, well then, never fear, because he, Michael Moore, will run a joke presidential campaign against her for the next two years (this from a guy who backed restricting the length of election campaigns in one of his better works). Moore maintains that virtually all criticism of Hillary Clinton is nonsense. What do we think, he asks, that she asks how many millions of dollars you've put into the Clinton Foundation and then she agrees to bomb Yemen for you? Bwahahaha! Pretty funny. Except that Saudi Arabia put over $10 million into the Clinton Foundation, and while she was Secretary of State Boeing put in another $900,000, upon which Hillary Clinton reportedly made it her mission to get the planes sold to Saudi Arabia, despite legal restrictions ‚Äî the planes now dropping U.S.-made bombs on Yemen with U.S. guidance, U.S. refueling mid-air, U.S. protection at the United Nations, and U.S. cover in the form of pop-culture distraction and deception from entertainers like Michael Moore. Standing before a giant Air Force missile and enormous photos of Hillary Clinton, Michael Moore claims that substantive criticism of Clinton can consist of only two things, which he dismisses in a flash: her vote for a war on Iraq and her coziness with Wall Street. He says nothing more about what that 'coziness' consists of, and he claims that she's more or less apologized and learned her lesson on Iraq. What? It wasn't one vote. It was numerous votes to start the war, fund it, and escalate it. It was the lies to get it going and keep it going. It's all the other wars before and since. *She says President Obama was wrong not to launch missile strikes on Syria in 2013. *She pushed hard for the overthrow of Qadaffi in 2011. *She supported the coup government in Honduras in 2009. *She has backed escalation and prolongation of war in Afghanistan. *She skillfully promoted the White House justification for the war on Iraq. *She does not hesitate to back the use of drones for targeted killing. *She has consistently backed the military initiatives of Israel. *She was not ashamed to laugh at the killing of Qadaffi. *She has not hesitated to warn that she could obliterate Iran. *She is eager to antagonize Russia. *She helped facilitate a military coup in Ukraine. *She has the financial support of the arms makers and many of their foreign customers. *She waived restrictions at the State Department on selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Qatar, all states wise enough to donate to the Clinton Foundation. *She supported President Bill Clinton's wars and the power of the president to make war without Congress. *She has advocated for arming fighters in Syria and for a 'No Fly' zone. *She supported a surge in Iraq even before President Bush did. That's just her war problem. What about her banking problem, prison problem, fracking problem, corporate trade problem, corporate healthcare problem, climate change problem, labor problem, Social Security problem, etc.? Moore parts company from substantive critique in order to lament unproven rightwing claims that Hillary Clinton has murdered various people. 'I hope she did,' screams Moore. 'That's who I want as Commander in Chief!' Hee hee hee. Then Moore shamelessly pushes the myth that Hillary tried to create single-payer, or at least 'universal' healthcare (whatever that is) in the 1990s. In fact, as I heard Paul Wellstone tell it, single-payer easily won the support of Clinton's focus group, but she buried it for her corporate pals and produced the phonebook-size monstrosity that was dead on arrival but reborn in another form years later as Obamacare. She killed single-payer then, has not supported it since, and does not propose it now. (Well, she does admit in private that it's the only thing that works, as her husband essentially blurts out in public.) But Moore claims that because we didn't create 'universal' healthcare in the 1990s we all have the blood of millions on our hands, millions whom Hillary would have saved had we let her. Moore openly fantasizes: what would it be like if Hillary Clinton is secretly progressive? Remember that Moore and many others did the exact same thing with Obama eight years ago. To prove Clinton's progressiveness Moore plays an audio clip of her giving a speech at age 22 in which she does not hint at any position on any issue whatsoever. Mostly, however, Moore informs us that Hillary Clinton is female. He anticipates 'that glorious moment when the other gender has a chance to run this world and kick some righteous ass.' Now tell me please, dear world, if your ass is kicked by killers working for a female president will you feel better about it? How do you like Moore's inclusive comments throughout his performance: 'We're all Americans, right?' Moore's fantasy is that Clinton will dash off a giant pile of executive orders, just writing Congress out of the government ‚Äî executive orders doing things like releasing all nonviolent drug offenders from prison immediately (something the real Hillary Clinton would oppose in every way she could). But when he runs for president, Moore says, he'll give everybody free drugs. I'll tell you the Clinton ad I'd like to see. She's standing over a stove holding an egg. 'This is your brain,' she says solemnly, cracking it into the pan with a sizzle. 'This is your brain on partisanship.'

Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN H illary and others irresponsibly accused Russia for the damning leaked emails ‚Äì aiming to distract attention from her wrongdoing. Sputnik News interviewed former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray. He explained '(t)he source of these emails and leaks has nothing to do with Russia at all.' 
'I discovered what the source was when I attended the Sam Adam's whistleblower award in Washington,' he explained. 'The source of these emails comes from within official circles in Washington DC. You should look to Washington not to Moscow‚Ä¶ WikiLeaks has never published any material received from the Russian government or from any proxy of the Russian government. It's simply a completely untrue claim designed to divert attention from the content of the material.' 
The pieces are in place to assure a Hillary victory on Tuesday. But the system is now so broken due to rifts inside the ruling class, that surprises might be inevitable. Photo by IoSonoUnaFotoCamera 
Hillary, campaign aides, DNC officials and media scoundrel press agents irresponsibly blame Russia working collaboratively with Trump. The Big Lie repeated enough gets most people to believe it. Given Hillary's unpopularity, maybe the tactic is less effective in her case. Whistleblower insiders uncover important information everyone has a right to know. They leak it to sources like WikiLeaks. Julian Assange and others working with him then publish it ‚Äì including a treasure trove of damning Hillary and Podesta emails. ‚Ä¶ Will it make a difference next Tuesday? Not if things are rigged for her as Trump claims. If he loses and challenges the outcome, things could get pretty dicey ahead.

ARTICLE

shorty Dispatches from Eric Zuesse 
O n November 1st, The Intercept headlined 'HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH THE STORY CONNECTING RUSSIA TO DONALD TRUMP'S EMAIL SERVER' , and the reporting team of Sam Biddle, Lee Fang, Micah Lee, and Morgan Marquis-Boire, revealed that: 'Slate's Franklin Foer published a story that's been circulating through the dark web and various newsrooms since summertime, an enormous, eyebrow-raising claim that Donald Trump uses a secret server to communicate with Russia. That claim resulted in an explosive night of Twitter confusion and misinformation. The gist of the Slate article is dramatic ‚Äî incredible, even: Cybersecurity researchers found that the Trump Organization used a secret box configured to communicate exclusively with Alfa Bank, Russia's largest commercial bank. This is a story that any reporter in our election cycle would drool over, and drool Foer did.' 
The Intercept team concluded their detailed analysis of the evidence by saying: Franklin Foer is an American warmonger and p.r. agent, a Democrat, and former editor of The [scurrilous Neocon] New Republic. Foer was a 2012 Bernard L. Schwartz fellow at the New America Foundation. 'Could it be that Donald Trump used one of his shoddy empire's spam marketing machines, one with his last name built right into the domain name, to secretly collaborate with a Moscow bank? Sure. At this moment, there's literally no way to disprove that. But there's also literally no way to prove it, and such a grand claim carries a high burden of proof. Without more evidence it would be safer (and saner) to assume that this is exactly what it looks like: A company that Trump has used since 2007 to outsource his hotel spam is doing exactly that. Otherwise, we're all making the exact same speculation about the unknown that's caused untold millions of voters to believe Hillary's deleted emails might have contained Benghazi cover-up PDFs. Given equal evidence for both, go with the less wacky story.' 
However, they failed to dig deeper to explain what could have motivated this smear of Trump: was it just sloppiness on the part of Slate, and of Foer? Hardly ‚Äî it was anything but unintentional: A core part of the Democratic Party's campaign for Hillary Clinton consists of her claim that Donald Trump is secretly a Russian agent. This is an updated version of the Republican Joseph R. McCarthy's campaign to 'root communists out of the federal government,' and of the John Birch Society's accusation even against the Republican President Dwight Eisenhower that, 'With regard to ‚Ä¶ Eisenhower, it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason.' 
Neoconservatives ‚Äî in both Parties ‚Äî are the heirs of the Republican Party's hard-right, which now, even decades after the 1991 end of communism and the Soviet Union, hate Russia above all of their other passions. Neoconservatism has emerged as today's Republican Party's Establishment, and (like with the Democratic Party's original neocon, U.S. Senator Henry 'Scoop' Jackson, the 'Senator from Boeing') they've always viewed Russia to be America's chief enemy, and they have favored the overthrow of any nation's leader who is friendly toward Russia, such as Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, Viktor Yanukovych, and Bashar al-Assad. Hatred and demonization of Russia is the common core of neoconservatism ‚Äî the post-Cold-War extension of Joseph R. McCarthy and the John Birch Society. Neoconservatives ‚Äî in both Parties ‚Äî are the heirs of the Republican Party's hard-right, which now, even decades after the 1991 end of communism and the Soviet Union, hate Russia above all of their other passions. 
Both Slate and especially Foer have long pedigrees as Democratic Party neoconservatives ‚Äî champions of U.S. invasions, otherwise called PR agents ('journalists') promoting the products and services that a few giant and exclusive military corporations such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Dyncorp, and the Carlyle Group, offer to the U.S. federal government. I'll deal here only with Foer, not with his latest employer (in a string, all of which are neocon Democratic 'news' media). Foer wrote in The New York Times , on 10 October 2004, against 'isolationist' Republicans, who regretted having supported George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq, and he headlined about them there, 'Once Again, America First' , equating non -neoconservative Republicans with, essentially, the pro-fascist isolationists of the 1930s. He concluded that they would come to regret their regret: 'Conservatives could soon find themselves retracing Buckley's steps, wrestling all over again with their isolationist instincts.' That's how far-right Franklin Foer is: he's to the right of those Republicans. .. On 7 June 2004, Foer, in a tediously long, badly written and argued, article in New York Magazine , 'The Source of the Trouble' , described the downfall of The New York Times's leading stenographer for George W. Bush's lies to invade Iraq, their reporter Judith Miller. He closed by concluding that 'the source of the trouble' was that Miller was simply too earnest and tried too hard ‚Äî not that she was a stenographer to power: .. 'People like Miller, with her outsize journalistic temperament of ambition, obsession, and competitive fervor, relying on people like Ahmad Chalabi, with his smooth, affable exterior retailing false information for his own motives, for the benefit of people reading a newspaper, trying to get at the truth of what's what. ' .. (She was anything but 'trying to get at the truth of what's what.' She was the opposite: a mere stenographer to George W. Bush and to the Administration's chosen mouthpieces, such as the anti-Saddam exiled Iraqi Ahmad Chalaby.) O n 20 December 2004, when the question of whether to bomb Iran was being debated by neoconservatives, Foer, who then was the Editor of the leading Democratic Party neoconservative magazine, The New Republic , headlined in his magazine, 'Identity Crisis: Neocon v. Neocon on Iran' , and he introduced a supposed non-neocon from the supposedly non-neocon Brookings Institution, Kenneth Pollack, to comment upon the conflict among ( the other Party's ) neocons: 'In part, the lack of neocon consensus [on whether to, as John McCain was to so poetically put it, 'Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran' ] can be attributed to the nature of the problem. Nobody ‚Äî not the Council on Foreign Relations, not John Kerry's brain trust ‚Äî has designed a plausible policy to walk Iran back from the nuclear brink. Or, as Kenneth M. Pollack concludes in his new book, The Persian Puzzle, this is a 'problem from Hell' with no good solution.' But, actually, both Pollack and Brookings are Democratic Party neocons themselves; and among the leading proponents of invading Iraq had been not only Pollack but Brookings's Michael O'Hanlon . Brookings had no prominent opponent of invading Iraq. (Brookings has a long history of neoconservatism , and routinely leads the Democratic Party's contingent of neocon thinking, even urging a Democratic administration to have its stooge-regimes violate international laws .) The real reason why neocons (being the heirs of the far-right extremists' Cold-War demonization of Russia, even after communism is gone) wanted to conquer both Iraq and Iran, was that both countries' leaders were friendly towards Russia, and were opposed by the Saud family who own Saudi Arabia, which family quietly worked not only with the U.S. government but with Israel's government, against both Iraq and Iran, as well as against Syria ‚Äî those three nations (Iraq, Iran, and Syria) all being friendly toward Russia, which both the Saudi aristocracy, and not only the U.S. aristocracy, hate. It's not just the conservative 'news' media that are neoconservative now. The so-called 'liberal' media are so neoconservative that, for example, Salon can condemn Donald Trump for his having condemned Hillary and Obama's bombing of Libya. Salon condemned Trump's having said 'We would be so much better off if Qaddafi were in charge right now' ‚Äî as if Trump weren't correct, and as if what happened after our overthrow and killing of Qaddafi weren't far worse for both Libyans and the world than what now exists in Libya. (But, of course, for Lockheed Martin etc., it is far better). CBS News and Mother Jones condemned the Trilateralist Joseph Nye for having veered temporarily away from his normal neoconservatism. Then, Nye wrote in the neocon Huffington Post saying that David Corn of Mother Jones and Franklin Foer of The New Republic had misrepresented what he had said, and that he was actually a good neocon after all. Nye closed: 'In any case, I have never supported Gaddafi and am on record wishing him gone, and also on record supporting Obama's actions in recent weeks. We now know that Gaddafi's departure is the only change that will work in Libya.' Sure, it did. Oh, really? It's Trump who is crazy here? More recently, Foer headlined at Slate, 'Putin's Puppet: If the Russian president could design a candidate to undermine American interests ‚Äî and advance his own ‚Äî he'd look a lot like Donald Trump.' Foer proceeded to present the view of Trump that subsequently became parroted by the Hillary Clinton campaign (that Trump=traitor). Wikipedia has a 450-person 'List of Republicans opposing Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016‚Ä≥ , and it's almost entirely comprised of well-known neoconservatives ‚Äî the farthest-right of all Republicans, the people closest to Joseph R. McCarthy and the John Birch Society. Foer cited many neoconservative sources that are not commonly thought of as Republican, such as Buzzfeed; and he even had the gall to blame the Russian government for having made public its best evidence behind its charge (which was true ) that the overthrow of Ukraine's democratically elected President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014 was no authentic 'democratic revolution' such as the U.S. government and its 'news' media said, but was instead a very bloody U.S. coup d'etat in Ukraine , which was organized from the U.S. Embassy there, starting by no later than 1 March 2013 , a year beforehand. Foer wrote: 'The Russians have made an art of publicizing the material they have filched to injure their adversaries. The locus classicus of this method was a recording of a blunt call between State Department official Toria [that's actually 'Victoria'] Nuland [a close friend of both Hillary Clinton and Dick Cheney] and the American ambassador to Kiev, Geoffrey Pyatt. The Russians allegedly planted the recording on YouTube and then tweeted a link to it ‚Äî and from there it became international news. Though they never claimed credit for the leak, few doubted the White House's contention that Russia was the source.' To a neoconservative, even defensive measures (such as Russia's there exposing the lies that America uses to 'justify' economic sanctions and other hostile acts against Russia) ‚Äî indeed, anything that Russia does against America's aggressions against Russia, and against Russia's allies (such as Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, Bashar al-Assad, and Viktor Yanukovych) ‚Äî anything that Russia does, is somehow evil and blameworthy. And, of course, America's aggressions are not. The U.S. government and its neocon propagandists are outraged that some people are trying to expose ‚Äî instead of to spread ‚Äî their lies. The American government isn't yet neocon enough, in the view of such liars. About the author =SUBSCRIBE TODAY!

[Graphic: Calais street scene by Harriet Paintin of Bow and Brush .] =By= Harriet Paintin and Hannah Kirmes-Daly Editor's Note The news of the destruction of the Calais refugee camp, known as 'The Jungle', has been pointed to by many as part of the hardening of European hearts to the terrible plight of refugees who have made it to their shores. It is relatively easy to make appropriate noises and go on with one's life, but add a visual component and what remains is much more haunting. This can be particularly true with an artiti's hand in the mix for his or her feelings and impressions are carried forward and the painting (or sculpture, or sometimes photograph) places us as a surrogate in that place and time. This clearly happens with this article so read at your own risk ‚Ä¶ and I hope you will. L ast week saw the brutal destruction of the Calais Jungle, Europe's largest unregulated refugee camp and home to around 10,000 people who have built communities, collective solidarity and even an autonomous economy. The eviction of the camp yet again calls into question Europe's asylum policy as refugees who have fled war, persecution and destruction once again witnessed their homes and community spaces razed to the ground, this time as part of a 'humanitarian effort'. French authorities declared on Wednesday that the camp was empty, but hundreds of people ‚Äî including unaccompanied minors ‚Äî remain in an incredibly precarious position, sleeping rough and at risk of arrest. Unlike most refugee camps in Europe where food and facilities are provided by authorities, the Jungle evolved as a relatively autonomous entity, more like a shanty town than a camp. Restaurants, shops, barber shops and community spaces lined the muddy high street, which served not only as small commercial enterprises, but also as spaces of collective solidarity where people would gather, share information and build their community. Without these networks of support, the experience of being a refugee is infinitely more isolating and confusing. The Day Before the Eviction The day before the eviction a tense, uneasy mood settled among the residents of the Jungle, many of whom decided to leave on their own terms. Rather than giving up their autonomy and freedom for a place on one of the state provided buses to 'Healthcare and Advice Clinics' (CAOs) and detention centers across the country, they left before they could be forced to leave, traveling to Paris, Marseille, anywhere they might have friends or hope of finding shelter. In one of the few restaurants which remained open, people attempted to keep a brave face as they spent the last day among friends with whom they had spent the last few months, years even. Some were resigned to whatever might happen the next day, throwing out light hearted comments to disguise their apprehension, 'we're not scared of the police! We're Afghan, the police should be scared of us!' A young married couple had only just heard the news of the eviction; they were frantically trying to work out how they could avoid the risks of separation, of detention, and of becoming locked into the French asylum system which is already crumbling in its own inadequacy to provide aid, security and safety to the vulnerable. Aged just 18 and 20 years old, they had traveled together from Eritrea, fleeing the horrors of dictatorship and indefinite military conscription, in search of safety and a life worth living. 'I just want a safe place for my wife. We want to build a life together; we can't live in camps anymore, relying on the state for tiny handouts and waiting in line for food,' exclaimed the young man. The only reassurance they received from a British volunteer was that, as Eritreans, they face little chance of deportation as Europe has finally recognized that Eritrea is an unsafe country, unlike Afghanistan. A middle-aged Afghani man who had been listening in on the conversation interjected at this point, 'who says Afghanistan is safe?! You ask your governments how Afghanistan can be safe, while drones and bombs fall from the sky, who sent them?! While your soldiers patrol our villages, who sent them?! Who is responsible for Al-Qaeda, for the Taliban?! Tell me!' Afghanis comprise a significant proportion of the Jungle's residents. In light of a recent EU agreement with Afghanistan which means that European aid money is dependent on the Afghani government agreeing to accept 80,000 deportees, Afghanis stand little chance of being granted asylum in Europe. This man highlighted the painful contradiction felt by so many in the Jungle, that the nations responsible for so much of the violence in their country turn them away when they seek protection. So many have already had their asylum cases denied in various European countries and now expect to be deported. Their long journeys of flight and hope will end right back where they started. The high street, once a buzzing center of activity, was deserted; the closed shops, restaurants and barber shops reduced to empty shells with broken windows lining a muddy street. The police perimeter was already firmly in place, a man cycling past with plastic bags of clothes was pulled over and interrogated. 'It's just clothes! Nothing else,' he insisted as the policeman in full riot gear roughly pulled out the contents of the bags, revealing just clothes, nothing else. Misinformation and Confusion French authorities claimed that 7,500 beds had been made available, that a simple registration procedure would see people onto buses to transport them to three CAOs across the country, or possibly detention centers. Three different lines for single men, families, and minors, marked out by pictograms. This registration would take place on October 24 and 25, with the demolishment of the camp scheduled for the 25th. Women's protest ( Harriet Paintin ) This information had been made available far too late to be translated and transmitted to the many languages and residents of the Jungle, meaning that Monday morning began with an overwhelming sense of chaos, disorganization and misinformation that would come to characterize the following days. Scarce scraps of information were filtered down through various organizations on the ground and painstakingly analyzed by everyone, volunteers and refugees alike, in an attempt to understand what was happening. As Clouchard states, 'misinformation is to democracy what propaganda agencies are to totalitarian states'. In the context of this eviction the lack of information felt like not just an organizational slip-up, but a deliberate attempt to misinform and mislead people. In the confusion that ensued, people were unable to take balanced, well-informed and empowered decision about their futures; instead, they were herded onto buses that they didn't even know the destination of. At one point, volunteers tried to hand out maps, to enable refugees to decide between the three locations that were supposed to be on offer to them. Officials shouted back, 'this is not allowed, people don't have a choice, don't give them a map!' The Registration Process Calais police registration lines ( Harriet Paintin ) With a heavy media and police presence the mood was subdued and access was restricted to accredited media (500 people) and a handful of volunteer organizations. Inside, people packed up their homes and belongings in the cold, gray morning light and headed towards the police lines for registration. The long line of unaccompanied minors waited for their futures to be determined by one woman peering into their face for about 30 seconds to decide if they were under 18. Inside the Jungle however, far from the complete chaos which everyone had been expecting, there were pockets of relative normality as those who did not want to take the buses busied themselves with their daily lives, cooking lunch for their children, playing guitar. As for the official demolition, the police cordoned off a tiny section of the camp and invited journalists to watch as they carefully dismantled it. When the real demolition began the following day all access to the high look-out point in the camp was restricted to journalists, where they would have been able to see the bulldozers and cranes destroying houses, and countless fires breaking out across the camp. Jungle house on fire ( Harriet Paintin ) One of the most noticeable homes on fire was a beautifully constructed two-story building complete with a terrace. The inhabitants had set the house on fire themselves as a symbol of protest; they did not want their home and their memories to be destroyed at the hands of the police. As the smoke climbed into the sky, they laughed and reminisced about their past years in the Jungle. Only three people of a community of more than twenty were left, everybody else had already left, to Paris, to flats in Calais; not a single one was planning on taking the bus. In the midst of this dehumanizing chaos there were several moments of resistance like this where people, for a brief moment at least, were able to take control of their situation and express discontent. Faced with extreme police repression and no individual rights, these actions were incredibly powerful. Individuals carried flags of their home nations up and down the line of policemen who stood stoic and expressionless in their riot gear. The women of the camp, so infrequently visible that their presence has even at times been doubted, organized themselves and protested against their treatment, calling out for 'safety and dignity for all women! Underage, overage, we're all the same! In [camps in] Paris we sleep on the streets!' The Fire At about 3am on Wednesday morning a huge fire started, burning all the homes and possessions left behind. A fire which quickly spread out of control throughout the camp and razed it to the ground, leaving the high street looking like a devastated ghost town. Later, the registration area quickly descended into chaos as people were told that the last buses were leaving that afternoon. The line for minors closed early and hundreds were told to come back the next day. In the midst of this chaos and confusion the destruction of the camp continued in full force as the bulldozers and cranes moved in. Calais Jungle burning scene ( Harriet Paintin ) 'It's exactly like the scenes we have run away from, it's just like watching our homes being burnt by the rebel forces' gasped one young man from Sudan as he gazed upon the desolation and destruction before him. After the last buses departed, the French authorities and some media outlets reported that the camp had been cleared and the eviction was a success, ignoring the hundreds left behind. Having been turned away by the authorities for the third day running, children were ordered back into a Jungle which by this time had become an apocalyptic scene of burning buildings, toxic smoke, exploding gas canisters. They had nowhere else to go but the streets, with no information about what options are open to them, if any. This eviction may have been dressed up as a 'humanitarian effort' but the blatant contradictions between the official line of events and the reality on the ground reveals gaping fault-lines in Europe's refugee policies. With unaccompanied minors left sleeping on the street, then by no stretch of the imagination has this been a successful operation. Rather, this is nothing but a complete failure on behalf of the authorities who are responsible for their protection. If the eviction was planned with the best interests of the Jungle residents in mind, then it would have worked out in a different way. There has been a refugee camp in Calais since the early 1990s, and after each eviction people have returned to rebuild. Long term residents of the Jungle believe that there is nothing that the authorities can do to stop people coming and trying to reach the UK; they are confident that before long, small camps will spring up again, but without the facilities and systems of mutual cooperation and aid that people have built in the Jungle their survival will be even more precarious.

We are at the point in Earth history, the breaking point. Humanity, (let's be fair shall we?) western 'civilization' has virtually killed the only home we have. There is no place for homeless humanity to go when this home becomes habitable only for cockroaches and similarly hardy beasts. Those in the worst offender nation, the United States, have allowed themselves to be pacified into disbelief that we are, or even can, destroy the only home we have. Much of that willing disbelief is founded on a welll orchestrated propaganda campagn carried out by the fossil fuel industry and the owners of it such as the Koch Brothers. The video below examines this decades long campaign that has been waged to lead a willing populace to the graveyard of humanity. 
We are literally at a point where days matter in reversing course. We (humanity) does not have centuries to address this problem. We don't even have decades. Some argue that if something significant is not done by 2017 to radically reduce the production of global warming gasses that it will be too late to avoid the worst that is coming at us. We are talking months ‚Äì not years. Recognizing the urgency, many organizations and publications are devoting major effort to addressing the destruction of our world. The Real News Network is starting a Global Climate Change Bureau. The Greanville Post and Uncommon Thought Journal are dedicated to bringing you consistent news, analysis, and engagement opportunities focused on ACD ( Anthropogenic Climate Disruption ) ‚Äì as Dahr Jamail argues, ACD clear puts the blame for the problem on humans. Please join us in this effort and send pertinent materials to Rowan Wolf at managing.ed@greanvillepost.com .

Scientists say Temperatures Will Rise to Critical 2¬∞ by 2050 
The Real News Network is Building a Global Climate Change Bureau 
2014 and 2015 each set the record for hottest calendar year since scientists began measuring surface temperatures over 150 years ago, and 2016 is shaping up to be even warmer. This will be the first time that we've seen three consecutive years with record-breaking temperatures. 
A temperature increase of two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels will now be reached much sooner than earlier predicted according to a report by seven leading climate scientists. 
'The 1.5¬∞C target could be reached by the early 2030's and the 2¬∞C target by 2050' says the report that included Sir Robert Watson, former Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The scientists say that even if all the pledges made by the signatory countries to the Paris agreement are fully implemented, climate will pass this dangerous mark in 34 years. 
This is a threshold that most scientists have warned cannot be crossed without dire consequences, including a rise in sea levels of several feet that would flood many coastal cities in the U.S., longer droughts, more intense heat waves that cause a major disruption in the world's food supply, and large migrations of people from countries of the global south. 
It is also a point where it becomes far more difficult to reverse the warming trend. Some scientists suggest temperatures by the end of the century could rise as much as 4-6¬∞C above pre-industrial levels. [1¬∞C equals 1.8¬∞F, so this is a temperature rise of 7.2-10.8¬∞F] 
The report titled The Truth About Climate Change says, 'Much of the public believes that climate change is only going to happen by the end of the century,' and that this is a misunderstanding of the urgency. Unless there is a dramatic change in current public policy, most people alive today will live to see the 2¬∞C threshold crossed. 
The report continues: 'Climate change is happening now, and much faster than anticipated.' Climate change related floods, droughts, more intense storms, heat waves, and wildfires have already had devastating effects on livelihoods, infrastructure, and lives.' 
If the 2¬∞C threshold is to be avoided, the report calls for far more aggressive targets than those set by the Paris Agreement and for that action to begin immediately. The report says, 'To meet the 2¬∞C target, global CO2 emissions should be net zero by 2060-2075.' 
The threat is catastrophic, the science overwhelming. So why aren't solutions to the climate change crisis at the top of the political agenda? 
Why don't we see millions of people in the streets demanding decisive action? Why isn't this a major issue in the election debates? Why are politicians who deny the existence of human-caused climate change even elected to office? 
The lack of American public engagement in the climate crisis is a global concern. If U.S. policy doesn't change, human life as we know it and thousands of other species will not survive. 
According to a Yale survey, 70% of Americans now believe global warming is real. If so, why isn't there more political pressure to face up to the crisis? 
Dig further into the numbers and the state of public opinion is more fully revealed. Of those who believe climate change is real, only half (53%) think that global warming is mostly human caused. One in three (34%) believe it is due mostly to natural changes in the environment. Only about one in ten Americans understand that nearly all climate scientists (more than 90%) are convinced that human-caused global warming is happening. Over half of Americans (58%) say they are at least 'somewhat worried' about global warming, but only 16% say they are 'very worried.' 
Why are only 16% of people surveyed very worried about what 90% of scientists think is a catastrophic threat? 
The Koch Brothers' war on science certainly plays a major role in promoting doubt about the overwhelming scientific evidence of human-caused climate change. They spend millions financing witch hunts against climate scientists and funding 'research' designed to confuse public opinion. 
The Kochs and other billionaires with a vested interest pour hundreds of millions into the coffers of politicians willing to obstruct legislation that would regulate fossil fuel and promote a green sustainable economy. 
Perhaps as responsible for the gap between public opinion and scientific evidence is corporate television news, 'The gatekeeper of public consciousness.' 
Firstly, they ignore the crisis. The report cited above was not the lead story on television newscasts. We can't find evidence it was carried by any U.S. television news outlet at all . 
According to a Media Matters report, the four major corporate TV networks aired a total 146 minutes of climate change coverage in 2015. ABC only aired 13 minutes of coverage and Fox's coverage consisted mostly of 'criticism of efforts to address climate change.' 
The report continues: CNN aired almost five times as much oil industry advertising as climate change-related coverage in the one-week periods following the announcements that 2015 was the hottest year on record and February 2016 was the most abnormally hot month on record. 
Only 16% of Americans are 'very worried' about global warming because corporate TV news doesn't want us to worry about it. 
Larry Wilkerson, former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell, says: While US foreign policy is mostly responsible for the growth of militant terrorist groups, the threat of a nuclear terrorist attack is existential. Think about what we'll do when 500,000 people are killed in New York City. We will declare martial law nationwide. We will be the most draconian tyranny you've ever seen on the face of this earth. But still I consider climate change a greater danger because it is a threat to the very survival of the human race. 
What are the reasons for corporate TV's lack of interest in the major news story of the century?The obvious answers are pressure from certain advertisers, the interests of corporate ownership, and the political intrigues of the fossil fuel industry. 
But I think it goes even deeper. 
In 2009, two years after the Fourth IPCC Assessment Report said, 'Warming of the climate system is unequivocal,' TV coverage of climate change was at its height ‚Äì a whopping 205 minutes for the entire year. Even former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich appeared in an ad with Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi calling for action on climate warming. 
Then something happened. 
A large section of the elites looked at what it would really take to meet the target scientists said was necessary to mitigate and stop the terrible consequences of climate change. They said, 'No way.' 
The transformation required to drastically reduce the use of fossil fuels and move to a green economy would change who has power and how business is done. There is no way to achieve the necessary reduction in carbon emissions without serious government regulation, a strengthening of the public sector, and massive public investment. All this requires a reduction in the political power of the fossil fuel industry and the financial elites associated with it. 
Gingrich renounced the Pelosi ad in 2011. 
The majority of the billionaires who control the commanding heights of the economy and politics are more interested in short-term profits and immediate personal gratification than some 'long-term' threat. They either fight against all climate change legislative action or support relatively weak measures to reduce carbon emissions ‚Äì better than nothing, but far from what scientists say is required. 
For most people of wealth it comes down to a simple calculation: My family and I will be ok . As the IPCC puts it: 'Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development.' 
People who understand the scale of the systemic risk are marginalized by corporate media and thus are marginalized in politics. 
A critical task in engaging large numbers of ordinary people in fighting and voting for a rational climate change policy is breaking the corporate monopoly on daily video news. We must create an independent, uncompromising source of global climate change news and investigative reports. 
The very first story ever produced by TRNN in 2007 was an interview series with George Monbiot on the urgent climate change threat. We produced a series titled 'Who Cares About Bangladesh' soon afterwards. 
We reported directly from the COP21 Climate Conference in Paris. 
We did in-depth interviews with climatologists like Dr. Alan Robock and Dr. Michael Mann who both worked on the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 
Economist Robert Pollin has appeared in numerous interviews with specific proposals for a transition to a green economy. 
We recently interviewed the esteemed actor Emma Thompson while she was onboard a Greenpeace vessel in the Arctic. 
We've reported on environmental activism from all over the world. 
We will soon be releasing the documentary 'The Doubt Machine: The Koch Brothers War on Climate Science' narrated by Emma Thompson. 
With our limited resources we have produced more than 535 reports on climate change since the fall of 2007 when we started our service. In 2015, we produced 1029 minutes of programming about climate change. That's more than seven times of all the major networks combined . 
We have produced more than 10,000 reports and interviews overall since we began our daily production. We also cover international and national news and now have a bureau in Baltimore reporting on the problems and solutions to the crisis of urban America. Millions of people have watched. We average 1.5 million views per month. 
While we have worked hard to keep a focus on climate change, what we have accomplished is far from enough. We need a Climate Bureau with sufficient resources to become a major daily video climate news service for online and TV. 
The power of daily video news is what shapes most people's world view and the field is dominated by news organizations that will not seriously address the problem or are in fact, part of the 'doubt machine.' 
It is clear that a radical change in the way the world produces and uses energy is required. Currently, about 82% of energy produced in the world is obtained by burning fossil fuels. How we produce energy without burning fossil fuels will be critically important as the world population is expected to grow by 40% to 10 billion by 2050.

W ill Trump pull a Brexit times ten? What would it take, beyond WikiLeaks, to bring the Clinton (cash) machine down? Will Hillary win and then declare WWIII against her Russia/Iran/Syria 'axis of evil'? Will the Middle East totally explode? Will the pivot to Asia totally implode? Will China be ruling the world by 2025? Amidst so many frenetic fragments of geopolitical reality precariously shored against our ruins, the temptation is irresistible to hark back to the late, great, deconstructionist master Jean Baudrillard. During the post-mod 1980s it was hip to be Baudrillardian to the core; his America, originally published in France in 1986, should still be read today as the definitive metaphysical/geological/cultural Instagram of Exceptionalistan. By the late 1990s, at the end of the millennium, two years before 9/11 ‚Äì that seminal 'before and after' event ‚Äì Baudrillard was already stressing how we live in a black market maze. Now, it's a black market paroxysm. Global multitudes are subjected to a black market of work ‚Äì as in the deregulation of the official market; a black market of unemployment; a black market of financial speculation; a black market of misery and poverty; a black market of sex (as in prostitution); a black market of information (as in espionage and shadow wars); a black market of weapons; and even a black market of thinking. Way beyond the late 20th century, in the 2010s what the West praises as 'liberal democracy' ‚Äì actually a neoliberal diktat ‚Äì has virtually absorbed every ideological divergence, while leaving behind a heap of differences floating in some sort of trompe l'oeil effect. What's left is a widespread, noxious condition; the pre-emptive prohibition of any critical thought, which has no way to express itself other than becoming clandestine (or finding the right internet niche). Baudrillard already knew that the concept of 'alter' ‚Äì killed by conviviality ‚Äì does not exist in the official market. So an 'alter' black market also sprung up, co-opted by traffickers; that's, for instance, the realm of racism, nativism and other forms of exclusion. Baudrillard already identified how a 'contraband alter', expressed by sects and every form of nationalism (nowadays, think about the spectrum between jihadism and extreme-right wing political parties) was bound to become more virulent in a society that is desperately intolerant, obsessed with regimentation, and totally homogenized. There could be so much exhilaration inbuilt in life lived in a bewildering chimera cocktail of cultures, signs, differences and 'values'; but then came the coupling of thinking with its exact IT replica ‚Äì artificial intelligence, playing with the line of demarcation between human and non-human in the domain of thought. The result, previewed by Baudrillard, was the secretion of a parapolitical society ‚Äì with a sort of mafia controlling this secret form of generalized corruption (think the financial Masters of the Universe). Power is unable to fight this mafia ‚Äì and that would be, on top of it, hypocritical, because the mafia itself emanates from power. The end result is that what really matters today, anywhere, mostly tends to happen outside all official circuits; like in a social black market. Is there any information 'truth'? B audrillard showed how political economy is a massive machine, producing value, producing signs of wealth, but not wealth itself. The whole media/information system ‚Äì still ruled by America ‚Äì is a massive machine producing events as signs; exchangeable value in the universal market of ideology, the star system and catastrophism. This abstraction of information works as in the economy ‚Äì disgorging a coded material, deciphered in advance, and negotiable in terms of models, as much as the economy disgorges products negotiable in terms of price and value. Since all merchandise, thanks to this abstraction of value, is exchangeable, then every event (or non-event) is also exchangeable, all replacing one another in the cultural market of information. And that takes us to where we live now; Trans-History, and Trans-Politics ‚Äì where events have really not happened, as they get lost in the vacuum of information (as much as the economy gets lost in the vacuum of speculation). Thus this quintessential Baudrillard insight; if we consider History as a movie ‚Äì and that's what it is now ‚Äì then the 'truth' of information is no more than post-production synch, dubbing and subtitles. Way beyond the late 20th century, in the 2010s what the West praises as 'liberal democracy' ‚Äì actually a neoliberal diktat ‚Äì has virtually absorbed every ideological divergence, while leaving behind a heap of differences floating in some sort of trompe l'oeil effect . Still, as we all keep an intense desire for devouring events, there is immense disappointment as well, because the content of information is desperately inferior to the means of broadcasting them. Call it a pathetic, universal contagion; people don't know what to do about their sadness or enthusiasm ‚Äì in parallel to our societies becoming theaters of the absurd where nothing has consequences. No acts, deeds, crimes (the 2008 financial crisis), political events (the WikiLeaks emails showing virtually no distinction between the 'nonprofit' Clinton cash machine, what's private and what's public, the obsessive pursuit of personal wealth, and the affairs of the state) seem to have real consequences. Immunity, impunity, corruption, speculation ‚Äì we veer towards a state of zero responsibility (think Goldman Sachs). So, automatically, we yearn for an event of maximum consequence, a 'fatal' event to repair that scandalous non-equivalence. Like a symbolic re-equilibrium of the scales of destiny. So we dream of an amazing event ‚Äì Trump winning the election? Hillary declaring WWIII? ‚Äì that would free us from the tyranny of meaning and the constraint of always searching for the equivalence between effects and causes. Shadowing the world J ust like Baudrillard, I got to see 'deep' America in the 1980s and 1990s by driving across America. So sooner or later one develops a metaphysical relationship with that ubiquitous warning, 'Objects in this mirror may be closer than they appear.' But what if they may also be further than they appear? The contemporary instant event/celebrity culture deluge of images upon us; does it get us closer to a so-called 'real' world that is in fact very far away from us? Or does it in fact keep the world at a distance ‚Äì creating an artificial depth of field that protects us from the imminence of objects and the virtual danger they represent? In parallel, we keep slouching towards a single future language ‚Äì the language of algorithms, as designed across the Wall Street/Silicon Valley axis ‚Äì that would represent a real anthropological catastrophe, just like the globalist/New World Order dream of One Thought and One Culture. Languages are multiple and singular ‚Äì by definition. If there were a single language, words would become univocal, regulating themselves in an autopilot of meaning. There would be no interplay ‚Äì as in artificial languages there's no interplay. Language would be just the meek appendix of a unified reality ‚Äì the negative destiny of a languidly unified human species. That's where the American 'dream' seems to be heading.

DISPATCHES FROM DANIEL ESPINOSA working to defeat the Big Lie in all its forms In the Manichean universe of US propaganda, the 'bad guys' seem to be fond of killing children and bombing hospitals. Having clearly identified the bad guys, the US, its allies and mainstream media ask patiently for a hesitant international community to act on its 'Responsibility to Protect'. By now it would seem mainstream media are tired of calling for humanitarian intervention in Eastern Aleppo to stop the Syrian Arab Army and Russian jets, tired of trotting out statistics and quotes from the terrorist/rebel-infested White Helmets (WHs) and the opposition-supporting Syrian Observatory of Human Rights, a one-man operation located in a London suburb, while completely ignoring civilian victims of a rebel force said to be composed of 50% al-Nusra (AKA al Qaeda terrorists. (1) Confident of their media cover, the WHs haven't been smart enough to hide their ties with the notorious al-Nusra and other terrorist factions and are now in danger of being fairly discredited. (2) At the same time, the SOHR, probably designed as a short-term propaganda asset at a time when rebel/terrorist funding was still obscure and the world didn't know it was actually Al-Nusra calling the shots in the ¬¥moderate¬¥ opposition side, is also losing credibility. But before the media is no longer able to sustain the lie even among their most uninformed victims, the chant of 'the international community must act' grows louder by the minute. But this time it's not just client states, lapdog allies and some weak third world 'regime', subject to easy de-stabilization, otherwise it would be business as usual: subvert, demonize, invade, set up a facade regime and get ready for the next target. This time there's Russia to reckon with. And Russia has her own independent reasons to be in Syria, ground zero for world terrorism. Gaddafi murdered by Washington-controlled jihadists. A mafia hit pure and simple, ordered by the biggest mafia outfit on earth. UK's Daily Mirror, a typical media shill for the imperialists, whitewashing the ugliness of what its masters did. In all these sanctimonious exercises favored by the Western media, in reality little but a Ministry of Disinformation for global capitalism, we should notice the rigid script followed by the press, the lack of options when demanding interventions, as well as a complete lack of any kind of explanation of how their proposed intervention is supposed to take place, as if 'humanitarian intervention' meant some sort of magical way to end conflicts and save civilians, all of which shows their complete disregard for the recent past. Many journalists‚Äîwho by dint of sheer ignorance (they too are subject to the brainwash afflicting most Americans, plus the pressures of careerism) are now lining up behind the 'no-fly zone' banner, some of them clearly not knowing exactly what it means, especially its sinister and extremely dangerous implications, but they know something better: Power (and their paychecks) demand it (again). As it did in 2003 when the official initial pretext to rally the country for war, Iraq¬¥s Weapons of Mass Destruction narrative, was losing steam, the people of Iraq ‚Äîaccording to our brave media‚Äîsuddenly started to need 'freedom' and 'protection', to quote the usual doublespeak. Needles to say the very same same Powers which had ruthlessly imposed a brutal regime of sanctions that killed hundreds of thousands of children and women between 1991 and 2003, were now eager to deliver humanitarian aid. (3) T hose children passed unnoticed by our deeply concerned journalists while the tragedy of their slow-motion death was taking place; their pictures not used to call for any kind of humanitarian relief or intervention, as the corporate media attention to the suffering of civilians tends to be very selective, as Ed Herman and David Peterson explain with typical lucidity in The Politics of Genocide: 'When we ourselves commit mass-atrocity crimes, the atrocities are Constructive , our victims are unworthy of our attention and indignation, and never suffer 'genocide' at our hands ‚Äìlike the Iraqi untermenschen who have died in such grotesque numbers over the past two decades. But when the perpetrator of mass-atrocity crimes is our enemy or a state targeted by us for destabilization and attack, the converse is true. Then the atrocities are Nefarious and their victims worthy of our focus, sympathy, public displays of solidarity, and calls for inquiry and punishment'. Eight years after Iraq's 2003 invasion, history repeated itself in Libya, where another putative tyrant was 'about to commit an atrocity against his own people', as was suggested by European leaders and a deafening mainstream media chorus. Eventually, the Great Hegemon, with headquarters in Washington, also heard the call for action, and joined the crusade. (Actually, the whole ruse had been plotted in close coordination in the true axis of evil of our time, the Washington-London-Paris triad of international gangsterism, with Obama's regime this time playing the coy, reluctant imperialist furnishing largely logistical and intel support). According to the British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, which was 'unable to visit Tripoli, Benghazi, Tobruk or anywhere else in Libya due to the collapse of internal security and the rule of law' in 2016, '‚Ä¶out of a total Libyan population of 6.3 million people, 3 million people have been impacted by the armed conflict, and 2.4 million people require protection and some form of humanitarian assistance'. (4) For its part, the Human Rights Watch stated, also in 2016, that '‚Ä¶Forces engaged in the conflict continued with impunity to arbitrarily detain, torture, unlawfully kill, indiscriminately attack, abduct and disappear, and forcefully displace people from their homes. The domestic criminal justice system collapsed in most parts of the country, exacerbating the human rights crisis'. (5) This seems to be the paradoxical result of a recent 'humanitarian intervention' from which the mainstream media is not morally prepared to take any valuable lessons. Of course, the paradox is nothing of the sort when you understand the real reasons behind the intervention, regarding the French government, and particularly its ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy, as stated by a US State Department intelligence advisor: 'A desire to gain a greater share of Libya oil production; Improve his internal political situation in France', among other supposedly deeply humanitarian causes. The US State Department, as expected, went along with the farce. B ut what is exactly a no-fly zone? According to US Army General Martin Dempsey in a letter to the US Congress in 2013: 'This option uses lethal force to prevent the regime from using its military aircraft to bomb and resupply. It would extend air superiority over Syria by neutralizing the regime's advanced, defense integrated air defense system. It would also shoot down adversary aircraft and strike airfields, aircraft on the ground, and supporting infrastructure‚Ä¶ Risks include the loss of U.S. aircraft, which would require us to insert personnel recovery forces. It may also fail to reduce the violence‚Ä¶' And going back to the House of Commons assessments of 2016, when '‚Ä¶France and UK argued that the international community should simply impose a no-fly zone‚Ä¶ former US Ambassador to NATO, Ivo Daalder, pointed out: ¬¥Cameron was pushing for a no-fly zone, but in the US there was great skepticism. A no-fly zone wasn¬¥t effective in Bosnia, it wasn't effective in Iraq, and probably wasn't going to be effective in Libya‚Ä¶ Gaddafi was attacking people. A no-fly zone wasn't going to stop him. Instead, to stop him we would need to bomb his forces attacking people.'' Of course, Daalder was describing the ineffectiveness of a NFZ while pushing for stronger measures. The crime of 'optional imperialist war' remained the same, regardless of the methods eventually used. Similarities with the Syrian 'civilian' uprising of 2011 abound, as UK Former Chief of Defense Staff Lord Richards of Herstmonceux later confirmed, intelligence on the composition of the rebel militias was not 'as good as one would wish', and when these rebels with affiliations to Al-Qaeda finally got their hands on the 'tyrant'‚Äîa man who had on numerous occasions been feted in Italy and France's capitals, and who had built one of the most advanced social safety nets for his people‚Äîthey simply do what jackals do, they tortured and murdered him, with the mainstream media, particularly in England and the US, reacting in a fashion that would make hyenas look like sheep: under headlines like 'Mad Dog Put Down' most front pages showed gruesome pictures of Gaddafi's last moments, the word 'murdered' nowhere to be found. Demonized 'tyrants' aren¬¥t murdered, they are executed or, as the New York Post stated: 'Killed by a Yankee Fan', in a humorous reference to a boy wearing a New York Yankees cap among the killers. (6) The New York Times' Kareem Fahim refers to the 'trophies of war', in an article filled with pictures of Gaddafi's and one of his sons' dead bodies surrounded by cheering men, where any other 'trophy', as his golden gun, is only mentioned briefly to give the idea he isn¬¥t referring to the corpses. (7) Andrew Gilligan wrote in the Telegraph: 'the one thing Gaddafi retained to the very end was his ability to put on a show‚Ä¶' (8). Ability shared by many journalists when cheering for interventions known for causing worse catastrophes than those that supposedly caused the intervention in the first place. Many rationales are given for the explicit, openly celebratory content. As Chris Elliot, The Guardian's reader's editor explains: ' On reflection ‚Äì and having read the complaints ‚Äì I feel less convinced about the way we used these photographs, although I still feel strongly that they are an important part of this story and should have been used. The scale of the photo on the newspaper front page of 21 October and prominent picture use on the website took us too close to appearing to revel in the killing rather than reporting it'. (Emphasis added). This reveling over Gaddafi's corpse reflects the celebration of an establishment victory by its subservient propaganda media, but it also served to focus attention away from the unlawful killing of many others, and the exact details of how the killing took place. As Media Lens observed: '‚Ä¶but there was more than the lonely killing of a 'tyrant' that went unreported. Human Rights Watch reported that between six and ten people appeared to have been executed at the scene of the Libyan leader's capture. Around 95 bodies were found in the immediate vicinity, many of them victims of NATO airstrikes. In fact, it is clear that NATO, with the assistance of Special Forces (although ground troops were strictly forbidden by UN resolution 1973), had maintained a no-drive zone around Sirte: a crucial factor facilitating the murder of Gaddafi. CBS reported 572 bodies 'and counting' in Sirte, including 300, 'many of them with their hands tied behind their backs and shot in the head', collected and buried in a mass grave'. (9) (Emphasis added) There should be little doubt regarding the reasons behind the selective use of pictures of bloodied children by mainstream media (and many NGOs), especially when they endorse calls for 'humanitarian intervention' against governments previously targeted for regime change, as it has already been clearly established in the case of Syria long before the 2011 uprising, via many US secret documents revealed by WikiLeaks. Propaganda is particularly transparent in this case: create a sense of guilt and impotence, prepare public opinion to demand what has already been planned elsewhere, in the darker councils of unaccountable power. The scandalous double-standard that selectively shows the suffering of 'worthy' children while hiding the pain and death of those victimized for sordid reasons by the 'Exceptional Nation' and its equally murderous accomplices dressed in civilized garb, is the great hypocrisy of our time, flowing smoothly from its deeply corrupt DNA. The obvious options such as putting an end to the funding of 'moderates' by the US, in reality the open funding of terrorists, is never considered, as important facts contradicting the official imperialist narrative are systematically omitted by the 'Free Press.'

B y BAR executive editor Glen Ford B arack Obama tried to woo Republicans into a 'Grand Bargain' that would have gutted Social Security. Bill Clinton let loose the banks. But Donald Trump's destruction of the Republican Party will allow Hillary Clinton to 'gather the whole of the ruling class under the same party banner, in one Big Tent, where the grandest of bargains can be conceived and achieved without crossing an aisle.' The rich are about to get their best deal yet. 'The exodus from the GOP has suddenly transformed the Democratic Party into the primary political instrument of the ruling class.' When Donald Trump took a wrecking ball to the Republican Party he provided the unexpected catalyst for completion of the corporate project begun by Bill Clinton, Al Gore and other white Democrats in the 1980s, with the founding of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC). To counter relentless attrition of whites to the GOP in their home states, these beleaguered, mostly southern Democrats sought national corporate funding to turn their party decisively to the right. They reckoned, correctly, that a steady stream of corporate capital would allow them to control the new wave of Black voters and politicians that had been mobilized by Rev. Jesse Jackson's two presidential campaigns, while strengthening the hand of the South in national Democratic Party calculations. Bill Clinton became the first DLC president in 1992, and moved swiftly and methodically to narrow the ideological differences between the duopoly parties. He completed much of Ronald Reagan's agenda, claiming it as his own; destroyed welfare 'as we knew it'; vastly expanded the mass Black Incarceration regime; pushed NAFTA through Congress over the objections of majorities in his own party; engineered the corporate monopolization of broadcast media; and removed the last safety straps from Wall Street banks. 'Clinton arranged the deployment of thousands of foreign jihadists to Bosnia and Kosovo.' In foreign affairs, Clinton initiated what was to become the doctrine of 'humanitarian' military intervention, dismantling and partially occupying the socialist nation of Yugoslavia. In the process, Clinton arranged the deployment of thousands of foreign jihadists to Bosnia and Kosovo, thus keeping operational the network created by the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Pakistan during the previous decade in Afghanistan. In Africa, Clinton conspired with Uganda and exiled Tutsi rebels to overthrow the Hutu majority government in Rwanda, setting off a bloodbath in 1994, followed two years later by an invasion of Congo that has killed more than six million people ‚Äî and still counting. Barack Obama was the second DLC president (although he lies [3] about his membership). He, too, moved with unseemly haste to reach a 'Grand Bargain' with the GOP ‚Äî not of necessity, since he had won a huge electoral mandate with the overwhelming financial backing of Wall Street, but as a matter of ideological principle. In January of 2009, before even taking the oath of office, Obama told the editorial boards of the New York Times and the Washington Post that all 'entitlements,' including Medicare and Social Security, would be ' on the table [4] ' for cutting in his administration. Obama's first project, now considered the centerpiece of his legacy, was to resurrect the rightwing Heritage Foundation's corporate health insurance scheme, adopted by Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole in 1996, and made into state law by Republican Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, in 2006. Obama's Affordable Care Act was, literally, written by lobbyists for the insurance and drug industries, and is now collapsing like a poorly constructed house at the end of its mortgage. 'For the better part of two years Obama debased himself, all but begging the Republicans to consummate his 'Grand Bargain.'' With the Democratic majority in Congress in no mood to tamper with Social Security and Medicare, Obama tried to maneuver the targeted entitlements into a financial crisis trap. He named two dependable reactionaries, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, as co-chairmen of his National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility, also called the Commission on Deficit Reduction. They dutifully recommended $4 trillion in budget cuts, mostly to social programs, including cuts to Social Security. Although the full commission did not endorse the chairs' recommendations, and the Congress failed to pass bills modeled on the document, Obama used the Simpson-Bowles formula as a basis for negotiating what he hoped would be a 'bipartisan' (GOP plus Obama and a minority of Democrats) massacre of entitlements. For the better part of two years Obama debased himself, all but begging the Republicans to consummate his 'Grand Bargain.' Congressional Black Caucus chairman Emanuel Cleaver, of Kansas City, called the deal a ' Satan's Sandwich [5] ,' but Obama continued to pursue a political marriage made in hell until the 2012 reelection campaign clock called a halt to the spectacle. 'A de facto super-party of the bourgeoisie.' The quest for a Grand Bargain was Barack Obama's failed attempt to best Bill Clinton in erasing the distinctions between the two major parties ‚Äì to create a de facto super-party of the bourgeoisie. It was the Republicans who ran away from the altar. And the Democrats did eat much of the Satan's Sandwich, through sequestration and austerity that ravaged social programs by other means. Why did the Republicans reject the deal? Although both halves of the duopoly ultimately answer to Wall Street, the Republicans, like any other party, have an institutional interest in winning office. It is true that Obama had crafted a deal that any Republican would love, but it was still his deal, and he planned to run for reelection as an historical dealmaker. Probably just as importantly, the Republican Party is the White Man's party, meaning, white supremacy is its organizing principle, central to its identity among much of the masses. To embrace Obama, no matter how advantageous to their big business patrons, was a hug too far for the GOP. Racism doomed the Grand Bargain ‚Äì Hallelujah! A New, Bigger Bargain Recently released Wikileaks emails reveal Hillary Clinton speaking to bankers at Morgan Stanley in 2013, a year after the debacle. 'The Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right,' she said. Thanks to Donald Trump's demolition of the Republican Party, the conditions have been created for Hillary Clinton, as DLC President #3, to achieve what #1 and #2 could not: gather the whole of the ruling class under the same party banner, in one Big Tent, where the grandest of bargains can be conceived and achieved without crossing an aisle. With most of the ruling class and its attendants having vacated the building, the Republican Party has been reduced to Donald Trump and his 'deplorables,' as Hillary calls them. Trump's opposition to corporate trade deals violated the Holy Grail against prohibiting capitalists from moving money and jobs around the world as they see fit, and his reluctance to support regime change as an inherent right of American exceptionalism has frightened and outraged the military industrial complex, the national security establishment, and all sectors dependent on the maintenance of empire. 'An inherently unstable arrangement.' Clinton's Big Tent is not a temporary, election season dwelling. It is how she plans to govern. The exodus from the GOP has suddenly transformed the Democratic Party into the primary political instrument of the ruling class, while at the same time the party nominally represents most of the folks who are abused and misused by that ruling class. It is an inherently unstable arrangement, and will soon be wracked by splits, as a post-Trump GOP attempts to lure its fat cats back and the darker and poorer constituencies consigned to the latrine area of Hillary's high class tent break to the Left for air. But in the interim, Clinton will have a unique opportunity to cut grand austerity deals with all the 'big elements' of Simpson-Bowles, to renege on her corporate trade promises, and to wage war with great gusto in the name of a 'united' country. Ever since the Democratic National Convention it has been clear that the Clintonites are encouraged to consider everyone outside of their grand circle to be suspect, subversive, or depraved. Their inclusive rhetoric is really an invocation of a ruling class consensus, now that Trump has supposedly brought the ruling class together under one banner. In Hillary's tent, the boardrooms are always in session. Source URL: http://blackagendareport.com/hillary_big_tent_grand_bargain

By BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley T he world's most reactionary regime, the head-chopping, terror-sponsoring Saudi Arabian kleptocracy, was awarded the chair of the UN Human Rights Council, while Russia has been kicked out. The travesty was engineered by the Superpower of Lies to punish Moscow for resisting the U.S.-led war of sectarian massacre and regime change in Syria. The War Party is on the march, to the cheers of corporate media ‚Äì and Hillary hasn't even been elected yet. 'All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the U.S. and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people.' Did Russia invade Iraq and kill one million people? Does Russia have a greater percentage of its population behind bars than any other country in the world? Did Russia occupy Haiti after kidnapping its president? Are Russian police allowed to shoot children to death without fear of repercussion? Is Russia entering its 20 th year of a terror war against the people of Somalia? All of these crimes take place in or at the direction of the United States. Yet the full force of propaganda and influence on world opinion is directed against Russia, which whatever its shortcomings cannot hold a candle to America in violating human rights. 
Simply put, Hillary Clinton must be denied a victory of great magnitude and any opportunity to claim a mandate. The dangers presented by a Hillary Clinton presidency cannot be overstated. She and the war party have been steadily working towards a goal that defies logic and risks all life on earth. Regime change [3] is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against Russia. Nearly every claim of Russian evil doing is a lie, a ruse meant to put Americans in a fighting mood and lose their fear of nuclear conflagration. It isn't clear if Clinton and the rest of the would-be warriors actually realize they are risking mushroom clouds. Perhaps they believe that Vladimir Putin will be easily pushed around when all evidence points to the contrary. 'Regime change is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against Russia.' The unproven allegations of interference in the presidential election and casting blame on Russia as the sole cause of suffering in Syria are meant to desensitize the public. It is an age old ploy which makes war not just acceptable but deemed a necessity. The usual suspects are helping out eagerly. The corporate media, led by newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post , are front and center in pushing tales of Russian villainy. Human Rights Watch and other organizations who care nothing about abuses committed by the United States and its allies are also playing their usual role of choosing the next regime change victim. Russia lost its seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council in part because of American pressure and public relations assistance from the human rights industrial complex. The UNHRC is now chaired by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy that funds the jihadist terrorist groups who caused 500,000 Syrian deaths. The Saudis are causing dislocation, death and starvation in Yemen, too, but they are American allies, so there is little opposition to their misdeeds. The openly bigoted Donald Trump has been the perfect foil for Hillary Clinton. That is why she and the rest of the Democratic Party leadership preferred him as their rival. He made the case for the discredited lesser evilism argument and his sensible statements about avoiding enmity with Russia made him even more useful. 'Newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post, are front and center in pushing tales of Russian villainy.' The United States and its allies are the cause of Syria's destruction. Their effort to overthrow president Assad created a humanitarian disaster complete with ISIS and al Nusra fighters who love to chop off heads for entertainment. Far from being the cause of the catastrophe Russia left its ally to fight alone for four years. They even made overtures to negotiate [4] Assad's fate with the United States. All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the U.S. and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people. The people of east Aleppo are being shelled by American allies but one wouldn't know that by reading what passes for journalism in newspapers and on television. The American role in the slaughter is barely mentioned or is excused as an effort to protect the civilian population. The bloodshed was made in the U.S. and could end if this government wanted it to. Nearly every claim of Russian evil doing is a lie, a ruse meant to put Americans in a fighting mood and lose their fear of nuclear conflagration. It isn't clear if Clinton and the rest of the would-be warriors actually realize they are risking mushroom clouds. Perhaps they believe that Vladimir Putin will be easily pushed around when all evidence points to the contrary. The anti-Russian propaganda effort has worked to perfection. NATO is massing troops on Russia's borders in a clear provocation yet Putin is labeled the bad guy. He is said to be menacing the countries that join in threatening his nation. The United States makes phony claims of Russian war crimes despite having blood on its hands. The latest Human Rights Watch canards about prosecuting Assad come straight from the White House and State Department and have nothing to do with concern for Syrians living in their fifth year of hell. 'Donald Trump has been the perfect foil for Hillary Clinton.' There is no lesser evil between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. She is fully supported by the war party in her desire for a more 'muscular' foreign policy. That bizarre term means death and starvation for millions more people if Clinton wins in a landslide. She must be denied a victory of that magnitude and any opportunity to claim a mandate. Peace loving people must give their votes to the Green Party ticket of Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka. They are alone in rejecting the premise of an imperialist country and its endless wars. The United States is the most dangerous country in the world. If it has a reckless and war loving president the threat becomes existential. That is the prospect we face with a Hillary Clinton presidency. If the role of villain is cast on the world stage she is the star of the show. Source URL: http://blackagendareport.com/russophobia_war_party_propaganda

By BAR editor and columnist, Dr. Marsha Adebayo T he 'revolving, rigged system' that purports to be American democracy was revealed in all its corporate vulgarity on a Baltimore university stage, last week. Two U.S. Senate candidates of the duopoly parties pretended to support the Green Party's candidate's right to join the debate, but failed to protest when cops hauled her away. 'This was their 'Rosa Parks' moment when they could have stood for integrity and democracy' ‚Äî but failed the test. 'The corporate media and the political duopoly collaborated to ensure that the Green Party message would not be heard.' US corruption during this campaign season is on full display for the entire world to ponder. No one paying even scant attention can deny the thin veneer that is used to hide state sponsored police murder of Africans, structural poverty and the cozy relationship between the 1% rulers in the Democratic and Republican parties. Green Party candidates, such as Jill Stein, Ajamu Baraka and Margaret Flowers have forced sunlight's disinfectant power to expose a rigged, racist and revolting political system that politically and economically devours communities of color, condones police murders of Black youth, intentionally exposes communities, like Flint, Michigan, to poisoned water, promotes drone warfare and the pilfering of the natural resources of Africa and South America. The system, however is finding it more difficult to block out the voices of dissent. Such was the situation this week at the University of Baltimore College of Public Affairs where Dr. Margaret Flowers, the Green Party candidate for the Maryland US Senate seat, was refused the opportunity to participate in the only televised debate alongside Democratic Congressman Chris Van Hollen and Republican state Del. Kathy Szeliga. The corporate media and the political duopoly collaborated to ensure that the Green Party message would not be heard. The sham excuse used to exclude Flowers was that her poll numbers had not reached 15%. But, of course it is difficult to reach the magic number of 15% in the polls when one is systematically excluded from debates and public events. This is the revolving rigged system that Black people know so well. 'When the police came to escort her off the stage neither candidate provided a meaningful protest of the anti-democratic process unfolding.' When the rigged debate started, audience members called for Dr. Flowers to join Van Hollen and Szeliga. Shouts of 'let her speak' could be heard from the audience. Responding to the audience, Dr. Flowers took her place on the stage shaking hands with both candidates. Standing on the stage, she turned her attention to the audience and said: 'I think it's important for voters to understand the differences between myself and Congressman Van Hollen and Delegate Szeliga.' With the police moving on stage to remove her, she said, ‚Ä¶'I mean, you say you're a public university and you want to educate the public, but without having a full public discussion, that doesn't actually happen.' While Van Hollen and Szeliga seemed to agree with Dr. Flowers participating in the debate, when the police came to escort her off the stage neither candidate provided a meaningful protest of the anti-democratic process unfolding. Delegate Szeliga noted that a third podium was available but both politicians remained silent while Dr. Flowers was forced to leave the stage. This was their 'Rosa Parks' moment when they could have stood for integrity and democracy but Van Hollen and Szeliga, failed to show the smallest amount of courage, leadership and commitment to anything greater than their individual ambitions and desire for power. Margaret was escorted by police to a sidewalk outside the debate hall and that symbolically represents the state of US democracy. After church on Sunday, a sister said to me, 'I know a lot of Black folks are going to vote for Hilary Clinton but I can't vote for the lesser of two evils. I've decided to vote for Jill Stein. I'm going to vote my conscience!' My only response after agreeing with her analysis was to add, 'Don't forget to also vote for Margaret Flowers.'

B y Danny Haiphong S yria is 'the target of one of the greatest misinformation campaigns in recent history.' The author regrets that left analyst Eric Draitser has contributed to the confusion. Draitser criticizes leftists who firmly support the Syrian government. Danny Haiphong counters that 'the left must act with uncompromising dedication to the principle of self-determination in every case where US and Western imperialism wages wars of neo-colonial plunder.' PHOTO ABOVE: Western supported Takfiri primes field gun supplied via Turkey. 'To claim that the left in the US should fight for 'peace' and at the same time oppose the Syrian government is an intentional attempt to remain neutral in a time of war.' Imperialism's war on Syria may be the most important question on the order of the day for those fighting for a world free of exploitation and oppression. Syria is currently the battleground of imperialism's last gasp of life. In nearly six years, Syria has been turned into a site of intense struggle between the forces of resistance and imperialism's forces of reaction. It has also been the target of one of the greatest misinformation campaigns in recent history. The imperialist countries and their media lackeys have sewed deep confusion about the true character of the war being waged on Syria. Nowhere is this confusion greater than in the United States, and it appears someone I deeply respect has been overtaken by it. Imperialism's war on Syria may be the most important question on the order of the day for those fighting for a world free of exploitation and oppression. Syria is currently the battleground of imperialism's last gasp of life. In nearly six years, Syria has been turned into a site of intense struggle between the forces of resistance and imperialism's forces of reaction. It has also been the target of one of the greatest misinformation campaigns in recent history. In a recent issue of CounterPunch, Eric Draitser dives head deep into the confusion [3] . He criticizes what he deems as two critical problems with the left's stance. Draitser first criticizes the pro-imperialist left for their decision to align themselves with the foreign-sponsored terror groups in Syria, which have been labeled 'revolutionaries' or 'rebels' by the imperialist countries. He then goes on to criticize leftists who have positioned themselves firmly in support of the Syrian government. ERIC DRAITSER: Usually solid analysis, but suddenly a plunge into rank political collaboration with the forces of imperialism which he supposedly opposes. The question is why act like a liberaloid? Given his record, we refuse to believe he is that dumb. It is his criticism of the 'pro-Assad left' that needs further examination. Draitser reveals his deep confusion when he asks: 'Will you continue to delude yourselves by refusing to accept the plainly obvious truth that no state or group has the best interests of Syrians at heart?' Draitser's question assumes that the Syrian and Russian governments are equally to blame for the chaos in Syria. Their bombs are assumed to be prolonging the war and committing atrocities against the Syrian people at the same rate of the imperialists. If this is not the case, he doesn't state otherwise in the piece. In fact, Draitser sets out to prove true what has already been proven false by a wide range of independent and corporate media sources. 'The imperialist countries and their media lackeys have sewed deep confusion about the true character of the war being waged on Syria.' First, Draitser claims that the war on Syria began as a genuine protest against 'neo-liberal' reforms instituted by the Syrian government. This narrative is popular among the liberal-left media as well as the white left generally. However, those who make this claim rarely specify what neo-liberal reforms were made or how the confrontation all of a sudden became violent. Stephen Gowans reviews numerous reports from the corporate media [4] that describe the uprising in March of 2011 as immediately violent, ill-supported, and ultimately insignificant in the midst of reforms from the Syrian government that were broadly supported by the Syrian people. At the same time as the violent uprisings, thousands of Syrians were protesting in the streets [5] in support of President Assad. US/Saudi supported Takfiri fanatics operating in Syria, and depicted by the media as 'moderates'. Furthermore, reports from the city of Daraa during the 2011 uprisings confirmed the presence of armed 'rebels' who had freshly arrived from their US-NATO backed destruction of Libya [6] . These 'rebels' have since infested the country through various channels of the Syrian border. Each group possesses a fundamentalist Wahhabi ideology and receives varying degrees of assistance from the Gulf monarchies, Israel, Turkey, NATO, and of course, the US. This is confirmed in Draitser's article. Yet he still reinforces the claim that a popular uprising started the war even though Assad possessed broad support in 2011 [7] . The truth is that the war on Syria has little to do with neo-liberalism or popular discontent. It has been acknowledged by UN sources that despite reforms, the Syrian economy remains highly regulated and socialist in character [8] . Syria's own form of socialism has brought many benefits to the Syrian people. Healthcare and education are rights guaranteed to all citizens [9] . Syria also possesses a secular government where Muslims, Christians, and all religious and ethnic groups lived peacefully prior to the war. Syria is thus a poor example of neo-liberalism. What economic struggles that do exist in Syria have largely stemmed from the harsh sanctions imposed by the US [10] in 2004. 'The war on Syria has little to do with neo-liberalism or popular discontent.' Furthermore, Draitser cites numerous sources that support regime change to smear the Syrian government and, by extension, the Syrian people. One of the sources receives much of its information from the White Helmets. The White Helmets have long been exposed as an NGO that works directly in service of imperialism's regime change operation in Syria. The organization receives approximately 33 million in funds [11] directly from the US and UK governments. Eva Bartlett recently visited Aleppo and witnessed many White Helmet workers sporting arms and fighting among the terror groups [12] . Draister also cites a source from the New York Post . The Post article relies heavily on documents collected by the dubious Center for International Justice and Accountability. This purported 'international law' NGO [13] is run by a consortium of corporate lawyers, former or current Amnesty International staffers, and various other servants of empire. The organization specializes in 'transitional justice.' In other words, the Center for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA) provides a legal framework for regime change on behalf of its imperial funders. Draitser claims no group involved in the war has the interests of the Syrian people at heart yet cites directly from an organization dedicated to the promotion of war in Syria. The NGOs and their partners in the corporate media have worked together to distort the reality on the ground. Aleppo is case and point. A ceasefire was brokered by all parties in late October that was supposed to allow Syrians to escape safely from East to West Aleppo. However, the humanitarian corridors were repeatedly shelled by the Nusra Front [14] , the US-backed Al Qaeda affiliate . The media decided to ignore this and report instead that the ceasefire's failure was due to the withholding of aid by Russia and Syria [15] . This is but one example of many where the Syrian government has been blamed for the rebel-sponsored terror inflicted on Syrian people. 'His analysis uses an abstract, moral argument to violate Syria's self-determination.' After five years of war on Syria, it is a wonder how anyone could believe a word that comes from the mouths of the imperialist countries. They lied about the origins of the conflict. They have continuously blamed the Syrian government for events that have all been traced back to the armed proxies they support. This includes the Houla Massacre [16] , the sarin gas attack [17] in Ghouta, and the so-called starvation of Madaya [18] . Aleppo is no different. The Syrian city has been under constant siege from NATO-backed terrorists. The terrorists are holding nearly 250,000 Syrians hostage in the Eastern side of war-torn Aleppo. This has been verified by journalists on the ground such as Vanessa Beeley [19] . These facts seem not to matter in Draitser's newfound assessment of Syria. His analysis uses an abstract, moral argument to violate Syria's self-determination. Calling those who unequivocally support the Syrian government 'fetishists' assumes that the US left should take a position different from that of the Syrian people. Actual Syrians supported Bashar Al-Assad, and thus the Syrian Army, with 88.7 percent of the vote [20] in the 2014 elections. To claim that the left in the US should fight for 'peace' and at the same time oppose the Syrian government is an intentional attempt to remain neutral in a time of war. As Howard Zinn brilliantly stated, one cannot be neutral on a moving train. And the imperialist war against Syria is moving dangerously toward a World War III scenario. Hillary Clinton will be elected the next President of the United States and has repeatedly expressed that she will pursue a no-fly zone [20] once in office. A no-fly zone would place Russian and Syrian military assets at risk of US-sponsored bombs and thus the world at risk of a global military confrontation not seen since World War II. How convenient it is then that Draitser should rebuke his former anti-imperialist stance in place of a stealth form of regime change. The world is on fire, yet Draitser has interpreted the situation as a chance to distort an already highly misunderstood situation . 'Draister's conclusions ultimately reinforce the Western assumption that the left must come to the rescue and save the Syrian people from their plight.' Positions such as Draitser's are ultimately shaped by the material conditions of an imperialist empire in crisis and decline. White supremacy has been a principal condition of US imperialism since its inception. The war machine and white supremacy are deeply connected. The peoples and nations on imperialism's hit-list are routinely depicted in a manner that justifies the need for US and Western military medicine. This notion has trickled down to the day-to-day actions of ordinary people, including what currently passes as the 'anti-war' movement in the US today. Draister's conclusions ultimately reinforce the Western assumption that the left must come to the rescue and save the Syrian people from their plight. Indeed, the Syrian people need allies and the left must be organizing toward an end to the war. But an end to the war cannot be achieved unless the left supports the will of the Syrian people. At the moment, this means the US left must align itself with the Syrian government and its allies. The left must act with uncompromising dedication to the principle of self-determination in every case where US and Western imperialism wages wars of neo-colonial plunder. Syria should be no exception. Of course, this critique should not be seen as a personal attack on Draitser himself. His body of work reflects a deep commitment to the struggle against war and Empire. He has often taken positions on international questions that are deeply unpopular with the US imperialist order. However, when mistakes are made, the left has a responsibility to correct them. There is too much at stake. Failure to step up in defense of Syria means another regime change scenario similar to what happened in Yugoslavia, Iraq, and Libya. Draitser's piece is a study into the path that all genuine anti-imperialists should avoid. But what is the correct path forward? Imperialism is the unquestionable cause of the war in Syria, so imperialism must be the primary target of an anti-imperialist movement. The US and its allies are risking world war over Syria's destruction. On the other side, the Syrian and Russian governments (along with Iran and China) are doing as much as they can to find a peaceful solution to the conflict that also respects Syria's national sovereignty. It is without question that this is the side where the left ought to be in the continued struggle to end the war once and for all.

B y Danny Haiphong Originally posted on 06/07/2016 L iberalism is 'an ideology rooted in a nation founded upon imperial conquest and rabid capitalist exploitation.' Its main proponent in is the Democratic Party, which 'has become the engine of US imperial rule.' Hillary Clinton is a twin of Barack Obama. 'While Obama intensified imperial war, austerity, and domestic repression, liberal supporters sat on the sidelines and watched.' Liberals wage fake wars on Republicans and real wars on the world. It's no wonder that the complacent liberals and liberal media, despite the pious posturing, did not stop any of the big postwar crimes of subversion and intervention, such as Korea, Vietnam, Iran, Chile, Guatemala and many others. 'An American liberal is the arbiter of a more effective politics of exploitation and oppression.' If anything, the 2016 elections have exposed the steep descent into bankruptcy of liberal politics in the US. The concluding years of the 1970s began a right-wing, authoritarian process in the US that grew from the roots of a capitalist economic base in decline. Historians and left academics framed this process not as a sign of decline but as a right-wing backlash. The term neo-liberalism was created to describe the backlash. However, 'neo-liberalism' was less new than it was an exposure of what has always been true about American liberalism. American liberalism has always been an ideology created by and for the interests of the American capitalist empire, regardless of the period. 
A house of concentrated infamy, for the most part the world's foremost assembly point for crooks and outright criminals. To be a liberal in America has meant being a participant in the highest form of opportunism. Liberals have historically championed the freedoms of American capitalist society and defended developments like the enslavement of Africans as a necessary evil. Once these evils become unmanageable, liberals jump ship and look to support more palatable forms of exploitation. For example, during the Civil War, many American liberals did not oppose slavery. It wasn't until the combined force of African rebellion and industrial capitalist development dug the slave-ocracy's grave that many liberals warmed to the idea of abolition. 'It was the bankrupt liberal leadership of the labor movement that collaborated with President Roosevelt to 'stabilize' capitalism.' During the Great Depression, US capitalism was on the verge of collapse. A recovery in the system seemed nowhere in sight. Socialists played a key role in organizing unions across industries to strengthen the position of the working class in this time of crisis. It was the bankrupt liberal leadership of the labor movement that collaborated with President Roosevelt to 'stabilize' capitalism. This leadership proceeded to settle for legislative gains and purge socialist elements. And so began the labor movement's descent into the back pockets of the Democratic Party. American liberalism has thus historically been able to fester and thrive in the US political landscape in periods of reforms in the capitalist order. The transition from chattel slavery to industrial capital, and subsequently from industrial capital to the so-called age of social welfare, gave American liberals political space to adjust their bourgeois principles to fit the needs of the time. In the current period of capitalist decline, this is no longer possible. The rule of capital has reached its highest stage and it must eliminate all that stands in its way of unfettered profit accumulation. This period of capitalism has stripped liberalism naked of its supposedly 'progressive' veneer. US capitalism has no room for welfare politics. The system's rate of profit is falling and its corporate debt is mounting. Finance capital has speculated the economic base of US society into a hole it cannot crawl out of. It is under these conditions that liberalism has revealed itself for what it really is: an ideology rooted in a nation founded upon imperial conquest and rabid capitalist exploitation. 'Finance capital has speculated the economic base of US society into a hole it cannot crawl out of.' I n the US, the home base for liberal politics resides historically in the Democratic Party. During the height of anti-communist hysteria and Black liberation insurgency in the mid 20th century, the Democratic Party was compelled to promote itself as a force of progress. To this day, the Democratic Party takes credit for Civil Rights reforms and anti-poverty programs that were pressured into existence by grassroots movements. However, the wheels of reform have reversed. No longer able to deceive the masses with crumbs, the Democratic Party has become the engine of US imperial rule. Liberals have been instrumental in this political shift. The Obama era has been the quintessential example of what liberal bankruptcy looks like in the age of neo-liberal, capitalist decline. While Obama intensified imperial war, austerity, and domestic repression, liberal supporters sat on the sidelines and watched. In some cases, liberal forces cheered on Obama's policies (like the intervention in Libya) and decried Republican 'obstructionism' as the primary reason for why social conditions continued to worsen under his rule. Yet these same liberals refused to acknowledge that it was Obama who sidestepped a Democratic Party majority in the House and Senate in 2009 and 2010 to push through the corporate Affordable Care Act and dash any hopes of universal healthcare being instituted in the US in the near future. 'While Sanders is no revolutionary force, his brand of liberalism is now outmoded by the world capitalist system that he sought to manage.' The case of Bernie Sanders in particular and the 2016 elections have broadly exposed the Democratic Party and its bourgeois liberal base for the agents of Empire they've always been. Hillary Clinton and her supporters have tirelessly attacked Sanders throughout the duration of his campaign. The reason for the attacks is simple. While Sanders is no revolutionary force, his brand of liberalism is now outmoded by the world capitalist system that he seeks to manage. Finance capital cannot back a candidate that calls for universal healthcare, affordable public university, or higher taxation of the rich. These policy proposals run in contradistinction to neo-liberal capital's need to turn everything into a profitable market to ensure its survival. When one asks what an American liberal is today, it is important to be honest. An American liberal is the arbiter of a more effective politics of exploitation and oppression. The American liberal supports the Democratic Party by waging a fake war with the Republicans while the entire establishment moves ever more rightward. The American liberal is no less an enemy of social progress than the right-wing, Republican oriented populace. The American liberal must be combated or its ideological stranglehold over emergent movements now and in the future will continue to lead them astray. APPENDIX The U.S. liberal ‚Äì the real greater evil. Liberalism: the hard and soft sides of the coinage of social control Submitted by Orwellian Ghost on Thu, 06/09/2016 E xplaining liberalism to North Americans is a thankless and possibly futile task, but it is one that must be attempted for clarity's sake. Liberalism is a theory of political economy that arose in Great Britain in the 17th and 18th centuries. Its principal inspirations were Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) and John Locke (1632-1704). It emphasizes individualism, human avarice, the 'virtue' of competition and the 'justice' of the marketplace. It opposed feudalism and mercantilism. It sought to replace the traditional landowners with the rising commercial and manufacturing classes. It sought to liberate capital, not people (and especially not women, slaves and propertyless males). Liberalism is the foundational ideology of the United States. American Conservatives (aka Tories or Loyalists) were expelled to Canada, the Caribbean or sent back to England. The USA (a few southerners excepted ‚Äì until the Civil War) began, and remains a homogenously liberal society. What, exactly, is liberalism? Here's what classical liberal economist Adam Smith (1723-1790) said: 'Whenever there is great property, there is great inequality. For one very rich man, there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the rich supposes the indigence of the many, who are often driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. ‚Ä¶ Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.' Liberal utilitarian Jeremy Benthan (1748-1832) added this: 'In the highest state of social prosperity, the great mass of citizens will have no resource except their daily industry; and consequently will always be near indigence ‚Ä¶ uman beings are the most powerful instruments of production, and therefore everyone becomes anxious to employ the services of his fellows in multiplying his own comforts. Hence the intense and universal thirst for power; the equally prevalent hatred of subjugation. ‚Ä¶ When security and conflict are in conflict, it will not do to hesitate a moment. Equality must yield.' This means that, in liberal societies, the rich are pitted against the poor, gaining their wealth by appropriating the work of others; and it means that government is in 'business' to protect the ruling class. Today, of course, there are two kinds of liberals. Soft-hearted liberals live mainly in the Democratic party. They sometimes toss crumbs to working and middle class people. In a pinch, they will do bad things reluctantly, but they will do bad things nonetheless, to protect the ruling class. Hard-hearted liberals live mainly in the Republican party. They do bad things gleefully, and never toss crumbs. They try to get racists and religious fundamentalists worked into a frenzy to oppose soft-hearted liberals, to protect the ruling class. They are the good cops and the bad cops, the soft and hard sides of the coinage of social control.

[Graphic: Clinton vs Trump by DonkeyHotey .] Paul Jay interviews Henry A. Giroux Editor's Note The idea here that there politics is theater is not new; however, 'political theater' has never taken on the connotations that embrace what this campaign has revealed. It is clear that there has been an agreement about what 'story' is being played out, but that has gotten repeatedly derailed by two (now 3) sources of counter-story. One source, as noted in the following interview, are the wikileak materials. Another source has been Trump himself. While he may not understand politics, he is very adept with theater and controlling the media, and he has played them like a piano. Throughout this endless campaign I kept remembering 'there is no such thing as bad press.' Trump has certainly proved the truth of that adage repeatedly. The third source is James Comey. His repeated breaching of judicial-political norms will likely reverberate well after November 8th.
Mentioned within this interview is the phenomenon of Americans seeming inability to maintain a long term memory. I believe this is a rich area to examine though this is not the focus of this discussion. Most people in the U.S. seem to live in the cultural equivalent of anteretrograde amnesia and lack the ability to make long term memories that extend beyond themselves. They remember their own histories, but their social memory is constantly being rewritten and little if anything seems to stick. Transcript PAUL JAY, TRNN: Welcome to the Real News Network. I¬ím Paul Jay in Baltimore. I¬ím known for a documentary I made called Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows. It was about professional wrestling and a battle between Bret Hart and Vince McMann and we got a lot of behind the scenes coverage in that and I got to know the wrestling world some. It occurred to me that there¬ís a certain kind of press that covers wrestling much the way a lot of press covers American politics. Now everyone that has any sense about them at all knows that professional wrestling is theater. In fact, the film I made helped kind of make that clear for everyone. But it is theater and everyone acknowledges it¬ís theater but there is still some press out there that plays along and covers the wrestling theater as if it¬ís real. Well I think much the same thing goes on in American politics. Much of the election campaigns are positioning, rhetoric, language, supposedly support this, oppose that, which is really all part of the theater. But because it does affect the horse race of the outcome of the elections, most of the corporate media covers all of this theater as if it¬ís real. Well something¬ís happening in this election which because of partly the bluster and in some ways weird honesty of Donald Trump, some of that theater is breaking down. The WikiLeaks about Hillary Clinton and behind the scenes machinations of the Clinton campaign, there¬ís been somewhat of a tear in the fabric of this theater. Now joining us to talk about this is Henry Giroux. Henry joins us from Hamilton, Ontario. He¬ís a professor of scholarship in the public interest at McMaster University and author of his most recent book, America at war with itself. Thanks for joining us Henry. HENRY GIROUX: It¬ís a pleasure to be with you. JAY: So, what do you make of the idea that wrestling and American politics have a lot in common? GIROUX: I think it¬ís a fabulous analogy. I think that in many ways what we see happening is the cultural celebrity which has never really been taken too seriously, although it confers a great deal of authority, has all of a sudden outed itself. It¬ís out of the closet. I mean people realize that what we¬íre getting is not only an exercise in performance and showmanship but we¬íre also getting what I would call, an elimination of the truth. The truth is one of the great causalities of this particular election cycle. It¬ís never been more visible than it is now. In one hand, what you have basically a celebrity who has no trouble lying because he believes that nobody will really take him too seriously because he thinks he really is a celebrity. On the other hand, you have the alternative press, you have the alternative media exposing all the nonsense that of course Hillary Clinton believes in and making it clear that she has no lock on honesty either. It seems to me that as the truth begins to disappear, questions are being raised about what are the conditions that produced this. What are the contradictions at work here? What does it mean for instance when Hillary Clinton says she believes in families and she believes in children and she worked for the Children¬ís Defense Fund when in actuality as the first lady, she had no trouble calling black youth super predators, she basically supported her husband¬ís welfare program which did horrible things for pro minorities? She supported an educational system in part that had nothing to do with the imagination and real learning. Had everything to do with accountability and standardization. So, it goes on and on. I think that as this fabric gets torn, as the veil gets sort of taken away and as the mystic of theater begins to dissolve, a kind of shocking reality emerges. One steeped in corruption, despair, inequality, poverty, systemic violence, racism, that becomes increasing difficult for the American political, financial, and corporate elite to basically legitimize. JAY: I think the Clinton campaign¬ís particularly interesting. First of all, you have a 74 senator from Vermont. If he¬íd had maybe another month or two, might¬í have actually might have won in terms of especially in his weakness in the south and amongst African Americans. Another month or two and he might have sorted some of that out. It¬ís quite remarkable that someone at least in terms of mainstream media, someone who came from obscurity, I think people that followed progressive politics, he was certainly well known. But for most of the country, they barely knew his name. To go from there to almost winning and there¬ís some suggestion, some of the specific state races he certainly didn¬ít lose fairly. Now you have the majority of the country simply says they don¬ít believe Hillary Clinton is a truth teller. They think she¬ís a liar. They don¬ít trust her. Yet she¬ís the only candidate these elites got. Trump lies exposed. Even the republicans, the fact that the system couldn¬í't come up with better candidates within the republican party to actually take on someone like Trump that should¬íve been an easy duck to shoot of anybody of any caliber. The whole caliber of these political candidates has just banal. GIROUX: I think what¬ís interesting here is that the republican party, they couldn¬ít come up with a decent candidate because they had no sense of the degree to which they had violated any principles that sort of [attaches] them to any notion of civic justice or to the economic issues that have caused enormous anger throughout the country, that they were unwilling to address. I think there¬ís another issue here. I think the issue is something you mentioned earlier about Bernie Sanders, who I find very hopeful, in that people don¬ít realize that language matters and I think what Bernie did, taking off from the Occupied movement which gave us a new language about inequality. Bernie gave us a language for economic and social justice and political justice in a way that we haven¬ít heard before because it was endlessly being replayed over and over again. I think that what you have there is you have the power of what I call a reimagination machine that attacks a disimagination machine. He took the disimagination machine which covers everything over in lies and false metaphors and indecent stories and corruption and he exposed them and I think that one of the great beginnings, one of the great movements for any form of insurrection of democracy is to make power visible. I think he did that. I think the black lives matter movement does that. I think they¬íre all driving liberals absolutely crazy because it¬ís becoming increasingly difficult for the liberals to basically defend this thing that they call democracy. It¬ís not a democracy at all. They know it. But they don'¬ít have a language to basically come back at this. I know. I was listening to a radio this morning and I don'¬ít know if you know this but the alt-right, they'¬íre responding to this by intimidating people, by attempting to ruin the lives of now I think it¬ís like 500 reporters throughout the United States attacking their families, putting stuff on twitter, putting pictures of their children up in ways that are utterly disgusting and vile. I think you see two moments here. You see a moment of impending fascism which is utterly violent and criminogenic. Then you see another moment which is criminogenic but not as violent. But¬í its grappling at the same time with some way to rescue itself by pointing only to Trump without at the same time pointing to its own liabilities. JAY: I think the sort of mediocrity banality of these candidates, it¬ís not just a happen chance, and many of the presidents in the past and I would put both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama ‚Äì they¬íre smart guys. I disagree with probably 98 or 99% of their policies and both of them were involved in what I think could be categorized as war crimes, including Bill Clinton and sanctions on Iraq and the drone policy and others and the development of the war on Syria with Obama and such and Libya of course. But that being said, these are smart guys. They speak in full paragraphs. They are articulate. They can crack jokes. They¬íre knowledgeable. But it was under their watch that we had a great leap in this transfer of wealth to the top 1 or so percentile. A great leap in the parasitism of capital. Casino capitalism. Massive derivatives and speculative markets and this very parasitical, very degenerate you could say type of capital created this orgy of profits for this top tier at a level they¬íd never seen before and when you live in the bubble of those massive profits, perhaps they have no idea what¬ís going on amongst the American people. So, all of a sudden they get this shock in the republican party and almost a major shock in the democratic party and I don¬ít know if they really come back from this because I don¬ít know if they can really get out of this bubble disconnect with what¬ís going on in terms of daily life. GIROUX: They meaning the financial elite. Is that what you¬íre saying? JAY: Well the financial and political elites, yea. GIROUX: Exactly. Well I don¬ít want to underestimate the power of the cultural apparatuses that they control to basically normalize what appears to be unimaginable. I mean I¬ím always shocked by that I think the real issue here is that we live in a country in which memory is very short. We live in a culture of the immediate. I¬ím often shocked about what gets forgotten 5 days after the news cycle. So, the real question is, how do you keep the count of memories. These images. How do you keep this language up? This critical language that consistently reminds people of the contradictions and the crimes. The United States is a war culture. I mean there¬í's no other way to talk about it. It¬ís primarily organized for the production of violence at almost every level. Of course, the punishing state is getting worse and the acceleration of police violence is getting worse. I think as long as the alternative media can focus on and sustain these images and these stories and these counter narratives, I think they¬íre fine. But it¬ís a hard fight because as you well know Paul the mainstream media controls most of the media and so the real question here is how do we take the question of culture and power and education and link it to everyday life in ways that allow it to travel across a variety of public spheres so that these memories and injustice and corruption can be sustained? JAY: Thanks very much for joining us Henry. GIROUX: My pleasure. JAY: And thank you for joining us on the Real News Network.

Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN N ever in the history of US presidential politics have media scoundrels allied more overwhelmingly for one aspirant over the other. Bias substituting for legitimate journalism is bad enough, disgracefully worse by featuring misinformation, distortions and lies about one candidate, while effusively praising the other undeservedly ‚Äì highlighting nonexistent virtues for Hillary, suppressing negatives disqualifying her for any public office. 
Why haven't other major media reported the news Fox News anchor Bret Baier broke Wednesday night about likely indictment(s) from the FBI's Clinton Foundation probe ‚Äì though not before it's completed weeks or months from now? The New York Times and Washington Post continue as lead Trump antagonists, one-sidedly promoting Hillary's candidacy, acting as virtual press agents. Times columnist Charles Blow calls him 'an existential threat' ‚Äì based solely on his rhetoric. As a businessman, he has no public record ‚Äì unlike clear evidence of Hillary's war crimes, racketeering and perjury. Lately, he's been staying on point in the campaign's late stages, diverging from his earlier bombast, apparently gaining support as November 8 approaches ‚Äì likely why intense bashing persists along with drowning out negatives about Hillary, especially multiple FBI probes of her email scandal and racketeering foundation. Focusing solely on Trump, Blow writes as follows: Donald Trump is a bigot. Donald Trump is a demagogue. Donald Trump is a sexist, misogynist, chauvinist pig. Donald Trump is a bully. Donald Trump is a cheat. Donald Trump is a pathological liar. Donald Trump is a nativist. Donald Trump's campaign (attracts) anti-Semites, Nazis and white nationalists‚Ä¶ Donald Trump (is a sexual molester), an unrepentant predator. ‚Ä¶Donald Trump is a lowlife degenerate‚Ä¶' Phew! 
Blow apparently believes Hillary is America's sweetheart, saying she's 'tolerant.' He's 'intoleran(t).' She's 'respect(ful).' He's 'disrespect(ful).' She's 'a politician with some flaws.' He's 'a flaw threatening our politics‚Ä¶America's existential threat.' No legitimate editor would touch Blow's rubbish. Times editors featured it. 
WaPo editors claim 'the only way Trump can win' is if voters forget or ignore what he's said. Despite lots of bombast earlier in the campaign, he's toned down his rhetoric, staying disciplined late in the campaign, and presented ideas on how he'll govern if elected, agree or disagree with him. 
No duopoly power aspirants for congressional seats and the nation's highest office represent popular interests ‚Äì no matter what they say. With rare exceptions proving the rule, they all represent dirty business as usual. Voters have to decide from a deplorable array of unpalatable choices, especially for president. 
Trump's main virtue is he's not Hillary. She threatens humanity with possible nuclear war. He'd rather profit from planet earth than destroy it ‚Äì and his business enterprises along with it. What type leader do you prefer at the most perilous time in world history? A simple choice for anyone valuing life over possible mass annihilation.

shorty Share This: Western claims that the 'moderate rebels' fighting the Syrian government are totally separate and antagonistic to ISIS are disproved by the fighting in Aleppo. ALEXANDER MERCOURIS Nothing illustrates the mismatch between Western reporting of the war in Syria and the reality on the ground better than an incident which took place on 1st November 2016 south of Aleppo. The Syrian government's main supply lines to Aleppo are the roads from the south. This has been especially so since the Jihadi capture of most of the province of Idlib together with its regional capital in the first half of 2015. As the noose tightens on the Jihadis in eastern Aleppo, with their latest counter-offensive repulsed and reports that the eastern districts of the city under Jihadi control are running out of essential fuel and other supplies as the cold weather closes in, the Jihadis attempted on 1st November 2016 to try to turn the tables on the Syrian army by cutting its road links to the south of the city. The Jihadi attempt to do this failed and was quickly repulsed, but in the process it exposed the truth of how the war in Syria is actually being fought. It has become an article of faith in the West that the Jihadi fighters in eastern Aleppo are 'moderate rebels' and that Jabhat Al-Nusra (ie. Al-Qaeda) accounts for only a small fraction of them. It is also an article of faith in the West that the Jihadi fighters in eastern Aleppo ‚Äì including those belonging to Jabhat Al-Nusra ‚Äì are deadly enemies of ISIS, and have nothing in common with ISIS. It is also continuously claimed in the West that the Syrian army and Russia are only engaging in token fighting against ISIS, and that they are almost exclusively concerned with fighting the 'moderate rebels' in Aleppo and elsewhere, who are trying to overthrow the Syrian government. Some Western commentators have gone even further, and have come close to saying that Russia, the Syrian government and ISIS are in de facto alliance with each other, as all three are collectively waging war on the 'moderate rebels' who are trying to overthrow the Syrian government rather than fight each other. The Jihadi attempt to cut the Syrian army's supply lines south of Aleppo which took place on 1st November 2016 shows how completely wrong these claims are. The attack was actually carried out by ISIS. Moreover the attack was clearly coordinated with Jabhat Al-Nusra (ie. with Al-Qaeda) which carried out a similar attack in the same area just days before. As recent events have shown, Jabhat Al-Nusra (ie. Al-Qaeda) is the dominant force in eastern Aleppo , though contrary to Western claims ISIS definitely has a presence there, as confirmed by this 10th October 2016 report by RT's Murad Gazdiev, which shows Jabhat Al-Nusra and ISIS flags flying together in the city. As our contributor Afra'a Dagher ‚Äì who is a Syrian writer actually writing for The Duran from Syria ‚Äì has repeatedly warned, the alphabet soup of differently named Jihadi groups in Syria merely disguises a single continuum of violent Wahhabi Jihadis all committed to the same cause: the overthrow of the Syrian government and the establishment of a sectarian exclusivelyWahhabi Sunni state in its place. Here is how Afra'a Dagher explained the role of ISIS in the Syrian conflict 'The 'Islamic State' has been designed to attract Takfiri (NB: Wahhabi ‚Äì AM) fighters from all over the world to join the war against Syria. That way the war to destroy Syria and break the Axis of Resistance is fought with no shortage of fanatical recruits. The war is sponsored and funded by Saudi Arabia, the true factory of Wahhabism, as well as by countries like Qatar and Turkey.' Whilst there undoubtedly are tensions between the senior Al-Qaeda and ISIS political leaderships, these have no practical relevance to the situation on the ground, where fighters from the different groups work continuously to defeat their common enemy, which is the Syrian government and Russia.

Share This: Dispatches from Eric Zuesse World War III ‚Äî the first (and final) nuclear war ‚Äî has never been so likely as it is now. Crossposted at strategic-culture.org PHOTO ABOVE: George H.W. Bush: Because of this man's duplicity and the malignancy of his breed the world could end up in a heap of radioactive ashes. This plutocrat‚Äîalong with his ilk‚Äî is a traitor to the human race. Here is the reason why we are currently even closer to a civilization-ending nuclear war than was the case during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962: During the Cold War, the two sides agreed that any war between the capitalist side and the communist side would escalate to nuclear war between the U.S. and the USSR and constitute Mutually Assured Destruction (M.A.D.). Therefore, because of this mutual acceptance of M.A.D., hot war didn't develop during that entire period, from 1945 till the Soviet Union dissolved and ended its military alliance the Warsaw Pact, both of which ended in 1991. 
Throughout that 45-year period, called 'the Cold War,' there was no hot war between the two nuclear superpowers, because both sides believed that any hot war would end in M.A.D. ‚Äî mutual annihilation, and the end of civilization. It would end that way because any hot war between the two sides would terminate either in one side surrendering to the other, or else in at least one of the two sides (presumably to be started by the one that's on the brink of defeat in the traditional hot war) nuclear-attacking the other (as being its only alternative to defeat). In other words, M.A.D. recognized and accepted the fact that for a nuclear power to attack a nuclear power with non-nuclear weaponry will almost certainly provoke a nuclear war at the moment when one of the two is losing (or about to lose) the conventional conflict to the other. Nuclear weapons are weapons of last resort, but they exist in order to prevent defeat. That's what they exist for. If Japan had had deliverable nuclear weapons, then the end of World War II would have been considerably delayed. Japan would have lost because it had no allies, but the end of WW II would have been very different than it was. Only M.A.D. avoided the Cold War becoming a hot war. 
B ut M.A.D. is not just a physical reality but equally importantly a mutually-shared belief-system , a belief-system that becomes no longer operative if one of the two sides switches to believe that a way exists actually to win a nuclear war ‚Äî in other words, to believe that conquest of a nuclear power by another nuclear power is a real possibility. During the years prior to 2006, there was an increasing though unspoken belief at the top of the U.S. aristocracy (the people who control the U.S. government ‚Äî or at least have controlled it since 1981 ), that the United States would be able to win a nuclear war against Russia; and, suddenly, in 2006, the belief was published, and virtually no one who possessed power or influence challenged it; and, from that time forward, M.A.D. was ended on the American side, and nuclear weapons became, in the U.S., strategized within a new framework (called 'nuclear primacy' ) ‚Äî the framework of nuclear weapons as constituting the ultimate weapons of conquest by the U.S. government. A fter 1991, when the Warsaw Pact no longer existed, the U.S. military alliance NATO invited into its membership all of the former states of the USSR except Russia (thereby indicating NATO's continuing hostility toward that particular nation and the fraudulence of NATO's peace with it), and also invited in all of the USSR's former Warsaw Pact allies, and so NATO (a now clearly anti-Russian, no longer at all anti-communist, alliance) has come to extend right up to Russia's own borders ‚Äî something that the U.S. had refused to allow the USSR to do to the U.S. in 1962, when the Soviet leader Khrushchev wanted to place nuclear missiles in Cuba just 90 miles from America's border. 
I n the new era during which the U.S. government and its allies believe that nuclear primacy is about to be achieved, the framework in which the use of 'nuclear primacy' would be 'justified' is that, as soon as such 'primacy' is believed to have been obtained (such as by means of anti-ballistic missiles having been installed that would supposedly annihilate Russia's nuclear arsenal before their warheads could even be released to retaliate against the U.S.-and-allied nuclear invasion), the U.S. side's 'defensive' traditional-weapons invasion of Russia is being defeated by the Russians, and so the only way available to prevent the defeat of the U.S.-and-allied forces is by the use of nuclear weapons (the 'taking-advantage' of America's 'nuclear primacy'). That's how the nuclear attack would be 'justified', as a 'necessary defensive response' against Russia. 
C onsequently, in the current U.S.-NATO operation on and near Russia's borders , the Alliance is starting the buildup of its traditional invasion forces. This includes even some U.S. allies that aren't in NATO . The supposed 'justification' for this amassing of invasion-forces on Russia's borders is to 'defend' against 'Russia's aggression' when (in March 2014 just weeks after the bloody U.S. coup in Ukraine ) Russia enabled the residents of Crimea to rejoin Crimea as part of Russia, of which Crimea had been until the Soviet dictator Khrushchev arbitrarily transferred Crimea to Ukraine in 1954 . That disagreement (entirely hypocritical on the US/NATO side) about Crimea is the supposed root-cause for NATO's involvement, even though Ukraine still isn't (and previously didn't want to be) a member of the NATO alliance. Anyway: this is the rationalization for NATO's buildup toward what could become WW III. The cult film On the Beach (1959) addressed the issue of a terminal nuclear war between the USA and the Soviets. Hollywood at least had some semi-worthwhile artists working to alert humanity to the expanding insanity. Today the main fare is chauvinist vehicles and rank childish escapism. 
Ever since 19 February 2016, the U.S. has been storing tanks and artillery , sufficient 'to support 15,000 Marines' in undisclosed 'confidential' Norwegian caves. Norway has a 200-mile border with Russia. CNN's news-report on that was accompanied by a video headlined 'Russia Reveals Aggressive Military Plans' . It reported that Russia's (democratically elected, though not mentioned as such) President, Vladimir Putin, was moving troops and weapons toward Norway's border. (How would the U.S. respond if Russia were to be storing invasion-equipment and troops in Mexico near the U.S. border? Would the U.S. be moving troops and weapons near the Mexican border to protect against an invasion of America; and, if so, then how accurate would it be if Russia's media then headlined 'America Reveals Aggressive Military Plans'? Hitler's Germany used those sorts of media-tactics, but this time Obama's America is doing that.) Marine Corps Times headlined on October 24th, 'More than 300 Marines heading to Norway in January' . ‚Ä¶ U.S. President Barack Obama means business: he's getting things set up for Hillary Clinton to finish as his successor. This kind of boldness exceeds anything during the Cold War. ‚Ä¶ America, and its greatly expanded NATO, thus now surrounds Russia not just with its tanks etc., but with its missiles and bombers, on and near Russia's borders, and so the flight-time from launch to the nuclear-bombing (if the ground-invasion of Russia encounters defeat) will be less than ten minutes, sometimes even less than the time for Russia to get its own missiles launched in retaliation against ours; and so a U.S. blitz nuclear attack against Russia could conceivably be an entirely one-sided war. Here is how that scenario ‚Äî the end of physical M.A.D. ‚Äî has actually become the objective sought by the U.S. government (and the necessary backstory for America's war-drills on Russia's borders): SANCTIMONIOUS EXCEPTIONALISM STRIKES AGAIN‚Äî Obviously the assumption is that the world has to trust America's 'inherent goodness' in its use of nuclear supremacy‚Ä¶ In 2006, the U.S. aristocracy published in the journal Foreign Affairs, from their Council on Foreign Relations, the first article which said that the U.S. goal should no longer be a continuation of M.A.D., but instead 'The Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy' , by which the U.S. aristocracy meant the rise of America's ability to win a nuclear war against Russia. It established this stunning goal merely by saying that such an objective could be achieved and that it should be achieved, and by the article's being published by the U.S. aristocracy itself (the people who control this country), and by furthermore the U.S. aristocracy not condemning and rejecting and repudiating it but simply letting that article stand with little to no public discussion (and no public debate) about it, much less with the chorus of public condemnations of it in the U.S. press, such as would have happened if America were a democracy ‚Äî but this nation no longer is a democracy, it has become an aristocracy , and this aristocracy had now published the 'Nuclear Primacy' article. (By contrast, in the obscure journal China Security was published in the Autumn 2006 issue the main critique against it, 'The Fallacy of Nuclear Primacy' . That article had no impact.) The Foreign Affairs article even was so bold as to assert that 'U.S. leaders have always aspired to this goal' (nuclear primacy) ‚Äî a wild and unsupported allegation that's not much different from alleging that not only George W. Bush but all U.S. Presidents after World War II were aspiring to have the ability to conquer Russia (and the authors were asserting that only now was this supposedly terrific ability coming within reach). It was explicit about G.W. Bush's having this desire: 'The intentional pursuit of nuclear primacy is, moreover, entirely consistent with the United States' declared policy of expanding its global dominance. The Bush administration's 2002 National Security Strategy explicitly states that the United States aims to establish military primacy.' That allegation was tragically true, which is one of the reasons why Bush (like his father, who actually started the determined policy to achieve nuclear primacy) was so dangerous and harmful a President. His invasion of Iraq was merely a symptom of that deeper disease. ‚Ä¶ And, so, this article about 'The Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy' and 'The End of' M.A.D., was now ‚Äî since it was published by the CFR and not rejected by any influential group ‚Äî accepted within the U.S. as a goal, 'Nuclear Primacy,' which the U.S. government could and should strive for. That idea, of a winnable nuclear war (winnable by the U.S., of course), was no longer heretical, no longer viewed as repugnant. In fact, this article had been introduced and accepted by Harvard University simultaneously in its longer form and simultaneously published by their scholarly journal International Security , which is the leading (it's the world's most influential) scholarly journal dealing with that subject, and its title there was 'The End of MAD?' . (The periods are customarily removed from the acronym 'M.A.D.', perhaps in order to associate the M.A.D. concept with the pejorative term, insanity. So ‚Äî at least in the United States ‚Äî the termination of M.A.D. has always had a favorable ring to it, even before that goal became effectively U.S. policy, which it has been at least ever since 2006.) And no one was saying that Harvard and its journal and the CFR were the ones who were at all 'mad' or anything similar, such as 'insane.' 
The aristocracy's stamp of approval upon the concept of nuclear primacy was clear, from at least 2006 on. Although M.A.D. continued as regards Russia's side, it no longer remained operative thinking on America's side. That's now clear, and this is Russia's predicament ‚Äî and the world's (because a nuclear war involving even just one of the two nuclear superpowers would destroy the world ). ‚Ä¶ 
U.S. President Barack Obama is putting the goal of nuclear primacy into place, starting with implementation of Ronald Reagan's proposed 'Star Wars' Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) defense system, now called the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system, and technically called by the name of its current embodiment: Lockheed Martin's, Boeing's, and Raytheon's, Aegis Ashore system, which Obama first made operational in Romania on 12 May 2016 . It's designed so as to enable a surprise nuclear attack against Russia in which any missiles that Russia might be able to launch in retaliation will supposedly (if the system works 100%) be annihilated during their launch-phase. Officially , however, its purpose is to defend Europe from being attacked by Iranian missiles. Any public U.S. admission that this 'defensive' system is actually preparation for a blitz U.S. nuclear assault on Russia is obviously out of the question. And, obviously, Russians know that Obama is lying and that this is preparation by the U.S. for a blitz nuclear attack against Russia. The West's 'news' media might be such 'fools' as not to be aware of that fact, but Putin has made quite clear that he is not, and he is preparing Russia to deal with it. O bama's action here was made possible by U.S. President George W. Bush's 2002 unilateral termination of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic-Missile Treaty with Russia's predecessor, the Soviet Union. Bush rushed forward with Reagan's 'Star Wars' program even despite there having been no successful tests of the necessary technology: the existing technology consistently failed but Bush decided to invest $53 billion of U.S. taxpayers' money in it . Bush in 2004 received British Prime Minister Tony Blair's participation and provisioning of locations and facilities to implement the plan , and Bush was also pressing both Poland and the Czech Republic to allow the U.S. to position ABMs there . Obama came into office criticizing the ABM plan and pretending not to be hostile toward Russia. He deceived Vladimir Putin into thinking that Obama sincerely wanted to pursue peace and cooperation with Russia. As soon as Obama became re-elected, his verbal smiling teeth immediately became actual glaring fangs. Then, soon after his regime overthrew in a bloody February 2014 coup the Moscow-friendly democratically elected President of Ukraine, bordering Russia , Russia started in the summer of 2014 to ignore the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, because for Washington the next step (beyond Ukraine) clearly now would be Moscow and so all bets were off. The installation of the Aegis Ashore in Romania likewise violates that Treaty , which is one important reason why Obama lies to say that all of the Aegis Ashore facilities will be targeted against Iran ‚Äî and maybe also North Korea ‚Äî but never against Russia. ‚Ä¶ The full Aegis Ashore system, which will require several such sites, isn't yet operational. NATO's PR-arm the Atlantic Council, has mentioned among the Aegis Ashore's benefits, that for the next such site, in Poland, 'Poland announced in late April that it would buy eight Patriot missile batteries from Virginia-based Raytheon Co. in a deal that could generate at least $2.5 billion in US export content.' The U.S. government officials and their friends who have invested in Raytheon and the other 'defense' firms didn't need to be informed of this by any PR person. They already knew of it from more reliable sources, and perhaps they even have invested in nuclear bunkers for themselves and their friends and their friends' friends . Lots of money is changing hands during this build-up. ‚Ä¶ Also in 2006, later in that year, specifically on 18 November 2006, was published at Global Research, which is an independent Canadian online international site dealing with geostrategy, a superb summary of the connection that this plan has to America's string of invasions in the Middle East. It's titled 'Plans for Redrawing the Middle East: The Project for a 'New Middle East',' by Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya, who explains: ‚Ä¶ It should be noted that in his book, 'The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geo-strategic Imperatives,' Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former U.S. National Security Advisor, alluded to the modern Middle East as a control lever of an area he, Brzezinski, calls the Eurasian Balkans. The Eurasian Balkans consists of the Caucasus (Georgia, the Republic of Azerbaijan, and Armenia) and Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan) and to some extent both Iran and Turkey. Iran and Turkey both form the northernmost tiers of the Middle East (excluding the Caucasus4) that edge into Europe and the former Soviet Union. The Map of the 'New Middle East' 
A relatively unknown map of the Middle East, NATO-garrisoned Afghanistan, and Pakistan has been circulating around strategic, governmental, NATO, policy and military circles since mid-2006. It has been casually allowed to surface in public, maybe in an attempt to build consensus and to slowly prepare the general public for possible, maybe even cataclysmic, changes in the Middle East. This is a map of a redrawn and restructured Middle East identified as the 'New Middle East.' 
MAP OF THE NEW MIDDLE EAST Note: The following map was prepared by Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph Peters. It was published in the Armed Forces Journal in June 2006, Peters is a retired colonel of the U.S. National War Academy. (Map Copyright Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph Peters 2006). Although the map does not officially reflect Pentagon doctrine, it has been used in a training program at NATO's Defense College for senior military officers. This map, as well as other similar maps, has most probably been used at the National War Academy as well as in military planning circles. ‚Ä¶ Brzezinski's advocacy of 'American Primacy' fits perfectly with the aristocracy's support of 'Nuclear Primacy,' and appeared eight years before it. His 1998 book was seminal also in many other ways. And, as that Nazemroaya article made clear, Brzezinski's plan was already being put into effect by the U.S. government, even before 2006. ‚Ä¶ However, the person who actually made the seminal decision behind all of this, the decision to conquer Russia, was U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush, on the night of 24 February 1990, just before the Soviet Union ended. He was the person who decided that after the USSR and its Warsaw Pact terminated, NATO would continue that cold war until Russia has been surrounded by U.S. allies, who are Russia's enemies, when Russia will ultimately either surrender or else be destroyed by the U.S. and its friends. ‚Ä¶ Even if Russia assumes that any such nuclear war would be M.A.D., the government of the U.S. no longer does. That's Russia's predicament ‚Äî and the world's . ‚Ä¶ However, military planners in the U.S. and its vassal nations, do not include in their calculations the world: the impacts that such nuclear winter and all the rest will have if their dream of 'nuclear primacy' amounts to anything more than merely the vicious hoax that it is. This fact, of their ignoring the world, is scandalous ‚Äî against our military planners. They are so obsessed with 'victory', that they are willing to participate in this false and potentially mega-catastrophic dream, of 'nuclear primacy'. ‚Ä¶ Unless and until nuclear weapons are totally eliminated (which might never happen), their constructive function, of preventing WW III, must continue, not end as a result of 'nuclear primacy' and other such lies and delusions. However, the 'news' media, especially in 'The West', are not pointing out those lies and distortions, but instead reinforcing them. ‚Ä¶ If there is to be a WW III, it will end the world . That is the key fact, which is ignored by 'The West's' military planners. [And the media prostitutes that serve the American empire's criminal objectives.] ‚Ä¶ NATO needs to end now, just as the Warsaw Pact did in 1991 ‚Äî when an indecent, oligarchic , 'The West' ‚Äîcontinued the Cold War despite the Warsaw Pact's end, and now is making it hot.

Share This: By Joe Giambrone What if everything printed this year about Donald J. Trump was 100% true, yet Hillary Clinton still wound up being the greater evil? What then America? 
If the American people are to purchase a product, then do they not have a right to know just how much lesser this 'evil' actually weighs versus the name brand? 
Like those seasonal Cadbury Cream Eggs that old familiar product has returned to the shelves: lesser evil, with more fat and toxins this year than ever. This repackaged, re-branded item is what many Americans claim to want every four years, the only thing they ever want or care about politically, and they attack those who refuse to purchase it. It's rather like a Black Friday zombie frenzy descending on Walmart, but we are told by TV that this is 'democracy.' It's not. It's oligarchy with bread and circuses. 
The so-called 'lesser evil' political philosophy is the only political philosophy these people seem to comprehend, but the core of the concept is overlooked. Their candidate of choice will admittedly commit evil acts. Do they not want to know what this alleged lesser evil entails? 
Seems like self-deception is intrinsic to supporting this little house of cards. Perhaps if the phrase was amended to 'evil but possibly lesser,' which is in fact more accurate, the public would spend a few seconds thinking about it when these Novembers inevitably roll around. 
Is a nuclear holocaust 'evil?' I suppose that's the crux of the debate we face today. One of those big two evil candidates has repeatedly, and irrationally, tried to provoke hostilities against nuclear-armed Russia, as part of some unstated agenda: the real agenda that has been torching the Middle East for decades. Wars of western conquest, which turned millions into hamburger, didn't just happen by themselves. Certain interests wanted to dismantle the oil-rich nations that considered themselves independent of Washington and the EU. The chaos of failed states was preferred to organized regimes that could form an independent bloc or fight back in any way.
According to Hillary R. Clinton, we should all be frothing at the Russians, and at Vladimir Putin for some set of vague claims without the substance that evidence would provide. Hillary and the Democratic National Committee were caught bloody-handed stealing the 2016 Democratic Party primary election from Bernie Sanders. Fraud. The only response she has mustered is the single word 'Putin.' Yeah, sure: Putin did it. Repeated so often the word has lost all meaning here in the states, but abroad these quite undiplomatic slights do not pass unnoticed. 
T he Russians unveiled their next generation ICBM , 'Satan 2,' capable of wiping out the central east coast of America, or all of France, or the UK, or most of California. You get the idea, but does Hillary Clinton ? 
She insists on a 'no-fly zone' in Syria, which the Russian military has already imposed against the invading US coalition , the one which has been arming and funding multiple armies of mass-murdering terrorists! 
Clinton privately told Goldman Sachs : ' They're getting more sophisticated thanks to Russian imports. To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we're not putting our pilots at risk you're going to kill a lot of Syrians‚Ä¶ So all of a sudden this intervention that people talk about so glibly becomes an American and NATO involvement where you take a lot of civilians.' 
In the name of protecting civilians HRC wants to kill a lot of civilians and attack Russian-supplied air defense systems, and Russian military personnel of course. The fraud that Hillary Clinton and the interests she represents care in any way about dead Syrian civilians is laughable on its face. US foreign policy has never, ever been based upon protecting the lives of foreign nobodies. To believe such a fairy tale would require complete, absolute historical ignorance. But then again we're talking about the American public. 
How 'Evil' is Hillary Clinton already? A merican corporate media refuses to call US war crimes war crimes. One can be impeached for a blowjob, but not for killing Nazi-level numbers of foreigners. There is no death count too high for the US Congress not to condone, if not to encourage. US foreign policy has never, ever been based upon protecting the lives of foreign nobodies. To believe such a fairy tale would require complete, absolute historical ignorance. But then again we're talking about the American public. 
Hillary Rodham Clinton has already played an instrumental role in the mass murders of approximately two million people, give or take. The Third Reich didn't bother with accurate tallies of its victims either. This figure shocks self-styled 'liberal' Americans so thoroughly that they simply refuse to believe it. 
Clinton, as Senator, not only voted for an illegal war on Iraq (command responsibility), but she told 'weapons of mass destruction' lies , selling the fraud to Democrats (lying to Congress). Estimates of Iraqi casualties range from half a million to a million and a half. The carnage continues to this day, and Crimes Against the Peace attribute responsibility for all the evil that results from initiating a war of aggression . This is codified in the UN Charter, and that makes Hillary Clinton also an international war criminal, just like Bush, just like Cheney. The hypocrisy of those who condemned Bush and yet joyfully cast a vote for HRC is staggering (yet commonplace). 
That was only one war. As Secretary of State Clinton took on even more responsibility for international crimes, notably the assault on Libya , another war of aggression. 
As the Russians noted , there was never any permission to bomb ground targets and help Al Qaeda linked rebels take over the country. 'We're witnessing a large number of violations of the resolutions of the UN Security Council. Over the last few days, there have been reports of the NATO air force bombing civilian targets, including hospitals‚Ä¶ This is an unacceptable situation; the United Nations Security Council did not authorize any such thing. Attempts to justify what's happening by claiming that the coalition does not go beyond the mandate are insufficient.' 
-Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov‚Ä¶ 
'Regime change' is a war crime , not an item on a menu for neocons to simply order up. Between 10 and 30,000 Libyans were massacred in the NATO-assisted destruction of Libya. Hillary Clinton displayed a gloating psychosis at the climax of the bloodletting. 
Onto Syria, with a current corpse count of 470,000. What was Hillary Clinton's role? Seymour Hersh's reporting contrasts against the endless lies of politicians: 
' A highly classified annex to the report, not made public, described a secret agreement reached in early 2012 between the Obama and Erdogan administrations. It pertained to the rat line. By the terms of the agreement, funding came from Turkey, as well as Saudi Arabia and Qatar; the CIA, with the support of MI6, was responsible for getting arms from Gaddafi's arsenals into Syria‚Ä¶ The annex didn't tell the whole story of what happened in Benghazi‚Ä¶ 'The consulate's only mission was to provide cover for the moving of arms,' the former intelligence official, who has read the annex, said. 'It had no real political role.'' 
Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was deeply involved in this covert 'regime change' plot, and the sequential wars resulting from it. To this day she insists on continuing the plot to overthrow Bashar Al Assad, the elected President of Syria. 
During her husband's administration another half-million Iraqi children were killed as a result of US imposed sanctions on medicine and water filtration components. That UN death toll figure was deemed 'worth it' by Madeleine Allbright in one of the most shocking news clips of the modern age. This unindicted yet confessed mass murderer campaigns openly for Hillary Clinton . 
There are other flash points where Hillary Clinton had a role, Haiti and Honduras for example. Scandals and atrocities have been reported, but this does not faze her supporters, nor most Americans who care nothing about the illegitimate actions of the US empire abroad. 
So Donald Trump's a pig, and the free world must play pretend that Hillary R. Clinton is not a proven and dangerous war criminal. Hollywood leads the charge and attacks dissenters. 
How deluded is America this year and how evil? 
Jill Stein of the Green Party is the peace candidate.

T he images are eloquent , so I will add nothing along those lines. But think of this: The world is still crammed with countless moral imbeciles who get their kicks killing these creatures. In the USA it is a huge community of depraved bastards with a huge industry behind them, a vociferous gun lobby, and a pliant, worthless and utterly prostituted political class and media. Don't get me wrong: I'm NOT a liberal. I am not seeking a ban on guns as that is a useless and unenforceable pursuit in a nation like the US. That train left the station a long time ago. And frankly I don't like the notion of disarming the citizenry, especially when the corporate-sponsored police state is growing by leaps and bounds, visibly and covertly, right under our noses. What I am against is for humans to train their guns (and bows and arrows and other pestilential forms of weaponry) on helpless animals minding their business in a dwindling natural space. All to get some cheap kicks. A 'legal crime'‚Äîhow's that for a glaring oxymoron‚Äî defended by a multitude of largely unchallenged baloney. 
One of the million reasons why the squandering of media time on crap‚Äîpolitical lies and cheap escapism‚Äî is a huge tragedy for humanity and those weaker species who depend on it. Meanwhile, visions like this should be used creatively by animal campaigners to push back against hunter propaganda, for example. The material is there. But the ineptitude of animal campaigners, especially the big orgs, is simply embarrassing. A disgrace.

The 'defense' budget is three quarters of a trillion dollars. Profits went up last year well over 25%. I guarantee you: when war becomes that profitable, we're going to see more of it. ‚Äì Chalmers Johnson 
Until it is no longer the case that M ost US C itizens H ave N o I dea W hat O ur G overnment D oes O r W ho I t S erves , I am just going to continue to insist that #muchniwogdowis is simply the GREATEST ACRONYM EVAR ‚Ñ¢!!!11!!! Today's demonstration of its awesomeness is an Op-Ed in The Nation by former Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) entitled Why Is the Foreign Policy Establishment Spoiling for More War? Look at Their Donors . He is 'fed up with the DC policy elite who cash in on war while presenting themselves as experts, at the cost of other people's lives, our national fortune, and the sacred honor of our country.' 
It's kind of adorable that Kucinich thinks our country has some sort of 'sacred honor' going for it. Nevertheless, I have always liked this d00d. 
Kucinich brought Articles of Impeachment against Dick Cheney and George W. Bush for high crimes and misdemeanors in connection with the Iraq war. His efforts went precisely nowhere ('impeachment is not on our agenda.' -Nancy Pelosi). When he ran for president in 2008, Kucinich's platform included : single-payer universal health care; bans on offshore drilling, toxic pesticides and privatizing Social Security; legalizing pot and ending the War on Drugs; and‚Äîmy personal favorite‚Äîcreating a cabinet-level ' Department of Peace ' to foster international cooperation. That last one naturally made him the laughingstock of the beltway press, punditocracy and Congress. There's no money in peace FFS! Well, not for the right people anyway. NO ONE WANTS THAT. When Kucinich ran for a newly redistricted House seat in 2012, he was defeated in the Democratic primary by Marcy Kaptur (D- Forced Birth Brigades ). 
In the Op-ed Kucinich goes after DC's so-called 'think tanks,' and the Brookings Institute in particular. He notes that Brookings, ' in a report to Congress , admitted it received $250,000 from the US Central Command, Centcom‚Ä¶Pentagon money to think tanks that endorse war?' And the Generals' preferred war policies isn't the only thing Brookings is shilling for: as Kucinich notes, the Food and Drug Administration, the US Department of transportation and the US Department of Health and Human Services all give money‚Äîtaxpayer money‚Äîto Brookings, which in turn promotes these agencies' preferred policies to Congress and the press with the sheen of academic gravitas and objectivity. 
Kuchinich says: 
'It is our patriotic duty to expose why the DC foreign-policy establishment and its sponsors have not learned from their failures and instead are repeating them, with the acquiescence of the political class and sleepwalkers with press passes.' 
Why? Because from their perspective these are not failures‚Äînot at all. See, what informed, rational citizens who value the security and wellbeing of humanity here and around the globe might call 'fucking epic foreign policy disasters,' are instead for the bipartisan DC establishment wicked smart, wildly successful, solid business decisions. 
Dennis Kucinich knows this of course; the point of his article is to shed some light on the real winners of our wars, and some of the dynamics at work that virtually ensure their continued victory. He's just connecting the dots into a picture that anyone can see if we cared to look. Generally speaking, we don't. It's an ugly picture. 
I think I'll just close with the hallowed words of preeminent 20th century philosopher Boy George : 
War is stupid, and people are stupid And love means nothing in some strange quarters.

Share This: PATRICE GREANVILLE T he problem is that, while helpful to have the empire's managers show their true sociopathic face, her narrative is a distorted simplification bearing all the vices of her political prejudices and ignorance, the script favored by the US ruling class. 
Consider just one of her major lies, tossed about casually and sure to be swallowed whole by the perennially clueless audience: That The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan‚Ä¶ The USSR did not invade Afghanistan . The besieged, progressive and modernising Kabul government‚Äîa leftwing government that promptly moved to advance literacy, gave women full and unrestricted civil rights, and in general was trying to bring the nation out of the middle ages (program which Washington could care less), invited the Soviets to come in, as it was meeting stiff resistance to its reforms by the entrenched landlords and reactionary clerics in the countryside. Moscow accepted the invitation because it also suited its valid objective of not allowing the Americans to plant another huge military base on the Central Asia underbelly, part of the encirclement of Russia the US has been carrying out for many decades. The invitation is similar and as genuine as the invitation by the Government of Syria, today, to come in and fight against the Western-sponsored terrorists, an authority to set foot on Syrian soil which the Americans and their multiple sordid accomplices in mayhem in the Middle East, totally lack. Contrast this with Washington's actions in Vietnam, where it first refused to recognize the right of the newly independent Vietnamese to a free election (since they knew the communists led by Ho Chi Minh would win by a huge margin), and then simply invaded that nation under trumped up pretexts (Gulf of Tonkin, etc.).The closer you inspect the US government narrative, the clearer it becomes it is a tissue of cynical big lies, word-twistings, professional pr.r. spin, and self-serving myths and simplifications‚Äîall in the service of sordid and criminal goals the elites can never admit to the American public.

By William Boardman, Reader Supported News Obama Is Pathetic on Human Rights in North Dakota 
We're monitoring this closely. And, you know, I think, as a general rule, my view is that there is a way for us to accommodate sacred lands of Native Americans. And I think that right now the Army Corps is examining whether there are ways to reroute this pipeline in a way‚Ä¶. So‚Äîso, we're going to let it play out for several more weeks and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that I think is properly attentive to the traditions of the first Americans‚Ä¶. ‚Äì President Obama on the Now This News website , November 1, 2016 I sn't that sweet? The President gave lip service to 'the traditions of the first Americans.' He didn't mention treaties between sovereign nations, of course, because he's not about to break with the traditions of the second Americans: that such treaties are only a means to a genocidal end and aren't to be taken seriously by the United States of exceptional, manifestly destined Americans whenever such treaties interfere with what the US wants. That's what 'properly attentive' means historically. Freely translated, 'properly attentive' means 'make a show of peace talk, them roll over them with whatever force necessary after it's too late to affect the election.' The legal mind is nothing if not properly attentive to elegant turns of phrase in its unyielding hypocrisy. If the President had any intention of honoring anything relating to the sacred lands of Native Americans, he would not be planning to 'let it play out for several more weeks.' Sacred lands have already been destroyed. Sacred lands are being destroyed no, not only by the pipeline construction but also by the massive militarized police response to nonviolent protest. Letting it play out for several more weeks only opens the door to the destruction of more ‚Äì even all ‚Äì of the sacred lands in the path of this lethal-to-the-planet pipeline. What is happening, what has been happening for months in North Dakota , is a travesty ‚Äì of justice, of common human decency, of the rule of law and standards of international law. And our president is on the wrong side of all of it, just barely responding in his docile, passive, articulate evasiveness. 'We're monitoring this closely,' says the President I f the President is monitoring this closely and remains willing to let it play out for several more weeks, that's a pretty clear signal that he has no serious problem with the creation of police state conditions in North Dakota. Besides an unknown number of private security forces working for Energy Transfer Partners (the pipeline sponsor), there are law enforcement officers from at least seven states that have cost about $10 million so far. That seems a ridiculously high price to pay to contain peaceful protest. And it's an even more ridiculous price for taxpayers to shell out to protect private profits. If the President is monitoring this closely without responding, that is a tacit admission that he has no serious problem with any of the egregious behavior so far by official and quasi-official paramilitaries and their wide-ranging mistreatment (apparently including criminal assault) of American citizens. In particular, he has allowed and continues to allow himself to be seen as approving: Unlicensed, apparently untrained private security forces using dogs to bloody peaceful protesters (who call themselves water protectors). State officials arresting and over-charging journalists for committing journalism. A local sheriff inflaming the public with false reports of 'pipe bombs,' when what he had actually heard was talk of 'peace pipes.' Law officers shooting nonviolent water protectors in the back and front with rubber bullets. State officials housing arrestees in dog cages and conditions that violate international law against torturing prisoners. Law officers on the riverbank using mace and pepper spray against nonviolent water protectors standing in the water. Official surveillance helicopters flying low to panic horses. Official surveillance helicopters mysteriously going off duty just before 'persons unknown' start a prairie fire (with such ineptitude that the wind blows it away from the Standing Rock Sioux gathering ground). Apparent contempt of court by Energy Transfer Partners, who sent its bulldozers to destroy a burial ground that, once destroyed, could no longer be a reason for a federal court to rule against the pipeline. Desecration is not a criminal act, apparently, when you have a government permit for it, even when that permit is under litigation. That's a lot of official abuse to tolerate, even for a president, and that's just a sampling of the police state techniques being tested in Middle America these days. 'And I think that right now the Army Corps is examining whether there are ways to reroute this pipeline in a way ‚Ä¶' T he President paused there, leaving the thought unfinished. The pipeline has already been re-routed, away from the state capital city of Bismarck after residents there expressed fear that the pipeline threatened their water supply. Now the pipeline threatens the water supply of the Standing Rock Sioux (and thousands of others), but that is more acceptable to the American power structure. The President has expressed no dismay at the idea that a pipeline rupture along the Missouri River would devastate huge numbers of 'the first Americans,' who have no other source of water. As one water protector put it : 'If it were to be contaminated,‚Ä¶ it would be a death sentence.' Why does the President think rerouting a climate-hostile pipeline is any kind of an answer to anything other than protecting the speculative bets of Energy Transfer Partners? If he were to consider this pipeline (any new pipeline) in terms of its impact on global climate values, this would be a no-brainer: no more pipelines. This is the Army Corps of Engineers we're talking about ‚Äì the Army ‚Äì and the President is the commander in chief who has no difficulty blowing up wedding parties and funerals with drones in some imaginary defense of national security. Why does he have such reluctance to protect planetary security? Why does he not just order the Army Corp of Engineers to go back to square one and re-do this process which was fast-tracked in the first place, for reasons that remain murky, and with the exclusion of interested parties with legal standing. But President Obama, on full salary as he campaigns for Hillary Clinton, shows no inclination to do any of this well or right. He's apparently much more confortable with false equivalencies and blaming the victims (also on Now This News): Yeah, I mean, it's a challenging situation. I think that my general rule when I talk to governors and state and local officials, whenever they're dealing with protests, including, for example, during the Black Lives Matters protests, is there is an obligation for protesters to be peaceful, and there's an obligation for authorities to show restraint. And, you know, I want to make sure that as everybody is exercising their constitutional rights to be heard, that both sides are refraining from situations that might result in people being hurt. For someone supposedly monitoring this closely, the President might be expected to know that people have already been hurt and most if not all of those hurt were nonviolent, peaceful protestors set upon by dogs and assaulted by rubber bullets, sound cannons, and chemical weapons. What fundamental, callous irrationality prompts this president to bring in Black Lives Matter? That is strange beyond comprehension. But perhaps it shines a light on that dark place in his soul that allowed him to react with almost no help or pity for the people of Flint, poisoned by their own governments, including the one President Obama is supposed to lead.

What will it take to bring America to live according to its own propaganda?  
ARTICLE

Itinerant Philosopher and Journalist Y ou say 'European cultural institutions', and what should come immediately to mind are lavish concerts, avant-garde art exhibitions, high quality language courses and benevolent scholarships for talented cash-strapped local students. PHOTO : Mozart, Bach, Beethoven‚Äîsome of the Giants that gave European civilization its right to claim supremacy over others. What would they think if they could understand the gravity of the cultural and social decomposition brought about by the embrace of essentially an immoral and downright criminal system of social organization? It is all so noble, so civilized! Or, is it really? Think twice! I wrote my short novel, 'Aurora' , after studying the activities of various Western 'cultural institutions', in virtually all the continents of the Planet. I encountered their heads; I interacted with the 'beneficiaries' of various funding schemes, and I managed to get 'behind the scenes'. What I discovered was shocking: these shiny 'temples of culture' in the middle of so many devastated and miserable cities worldwide (devastated by Western imperialism and by its closest allies ‚Äì the shameless local elites), are actually extremely closely linked to Western intelligence organizations. They are directly involved in the neo-colonialist project, which is implemented virtually on all continents of the world, by North America, Europe and Japan. 'Culture' is used to re-educate and to indoctrinate mainly the children of the local elites. Funding and grants are put to work where threats and killing were applied before. How does it work? It is actually all quite simple: rebellious, socially-oriented and anti-imperialist local artists and thinkers are now shamelessly bought and corrupted. Their egos are played on with great skill. Trips abroad for 'young and talented artists' are arranged, funding dispersed, scholarships offered. Carrots are too tasty, most would say, 'irresistible'. Seals of approval from the Empire are ready to stamp those blank pages of the lives of still young, unrecognized but angry and sharp young artists and intellectuals from those poor, colonized countries. It is so easy to betray! It is so easy to bend. Some, very few countries are almost incorruptible, like Cuba. But Cuba is a unique country. And it is intensively demonized by Western propaganda. 'La Patria no se vende!' they say there, or in translation 'One does not sell the Fatherland!' But one, unfortunately, does, almost everywhere else in the world: from Indonesia to Turkey, from Kenya to India. *** ' Aurora' opens in a small cafe in an ancient city in Indonesia (which is not called Indonesia). Hans, the German head of an unnamed cultural institute is talking to his local 'disciples'. He loves his life here: all the respect he gets, those countless women he is sexually possessing and humiliating, the lavish lifestyle he is allowed to lead. A woman enters; a beautiful woman, a proud woman, an artist, a woman who was born here but who left, many years ago, for far away Venezuela. Her name is Aurora. Her husband is Orozco, a renowned revolutionary painter. Aurora's sister was killed in this country, because she refused to give up her revolutionary art. She was kidnapped, tortured, raped, and then murdered. Hans, the head of a European cultural organization, was involved. Aurora confronts Hans, and in reality, the entire European culture of plunder and colonialism. And that night she is joined, she is supported, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, or more precisely, by his merry ghost, who is thoroughly disgusted of being used as one of the symbols of the 'culture' which destroyed him personally, which destroyed the very essence of the arts, and which has been in fact destroying, for centuries, this entire Planet. *** When I recently shared the plot of 'Aurora' with a local 'independent' filmmaker in Khartoum, Sudan, he first listened attentively, and then with horror, and in the end he made a hasty dash towards the door. He escaped, not even trying to hide his distress. Later I was told that he is fully funded by Western 'cultural institutions'. After reading it, my African comrades, several leading anti-imperialist fighters, immediately endorsed the book, claiming that it addressed some of the essential problems their continent is facing. The cultural destruction the Empire is spreading is similar everywhere: in Africa, Asia and in Latin America. 
I wrote 'Aurora' as a work of art, as fiction. But I also wrote it as a J'accuse 1 ‚Äì a detailed study of cultural imperialism. 
My dream is that it would be read by millions of young thinkers and artists, on all continents, that it would help them to understand how the Empire operates, and how filthy and disgraceful betrayal is. 
1 J'accuse is French for 'I accuse,' and is generally used to mean an attack against social injustice. It references a 1898 newspaper article by Emile Zola who accused the French government of fabricating a charge of treason against a Jewish military officer, Alfred Dreyfus, because he was Jewish.

[Photo: US missiles found in ISIS stronghold in Mosul, Iraq.] =By= Kurt Nimmo Editor's Note Reports continue of active U.S. support of ISIS while at the same time the U.S. serves a support role with Iraqi forces in their efforts to retake ISIS controlled areas in Iraq. Also reported by the Pentagon is that what is learned in the Iraqi actions will be applied in Syria. When the US has a jockey on every horse in the race, it does mean that U.S. interests are likely to be served no matter who crosses the finish line. T he Iraqis found missiles at an Islamic State base in Mosul stamped with USA and DOD.
The discovery did not warrant a headline on CNN or The New York Times. 
'Several US-made missiles were found in al-Shoura region to the South of Mosul,' reports Iran's al-Alam News Network , citing a local source. 
'The ISIL terrorists have sent US-made TOW anti-tank missiles to Tal Afar and it is quite evident that they are preparing for a long-term war,' an Iraqi security official told an Arabic-language media outlet. 
In early 2015 Qasim al-Araji, the head of the Badr Organization in Iraq, told parliament he had evidence the US armed the Islamic State, according to a report carried by the Arabic language Almasalah . 
Iranian media and other sources claim US military aircraft dropped weapons in areas held by the Islamic State. 
'The Iraqi intelligence sources reiterated that the US military planes have airdropped several aid cargoes for ISIL terrorists to help them resist the siege laid by the Iraqi army, security and popular forces,' Iraqi intelligence claimed in December, 2014. 
'What is important is that the US sends these weapons to only those that cooperate with the Pentagon and this indicates that the US plays a role in arming the ISIL.' 
In January 2015 Iraqi MP Majid al-Ghraoui said American aircraft delivered weapons and equipment to ISIS southeast of Tikrit, located in Salahuddin province. 
'The Iraqi Parliament's National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,' the leader of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. 
Last February Iran's FAR News Agency reported the Iraq Army shot down two British planes delivering weapons to the Islamic State. 
Both the Islamic State and al-Nusra are in possession of US-made BGM 71E TOW anti-tank missiles. 
The London-based organization Conflict Armament Research (CAR) previously reported that ISIS fighters are using 'significant quantities' of arms including M16 assault rifles marked 'property of the US government.' 
CAR has documented a CIA-Saudi program begun in 2012 that has provided thousands of tons of weaponry to 'insurgents' (jihadi mercenaries) in Syria. The weapons are shared with the Islamic State. 
'Conflict Armament Research was able to trace the serial numbers of weapons recovered by Kurds battling ISIS in Eastern Syria back directly to the CIA-Saudi weapons airlift program,' notes Brad Hoff for Levant Report. 
If Hillary Clinton is elected next week the restocking of the Islamic State's arsenal and the war in Syria will continue. 
'Secretary of State Hillary Clinton waived restrictions at the State Department on selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Qatar, all states that had donated to the Clinton Foundation. Saudi Arabia had chipped in at least $10 million, and Boeing added another $900,000 as Secretary Clinton made it her mission to get Saudi Arabia the planes with which it would attack Yemen,' writes David Swanson . 
Clinton is well aware the Gulf Emirates arm and provide logistical assistance to the Islamic State. 
'While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region,' Clinton wrote in an email to John Podesta . 
Clinton did not mention Obama's secret authorization in 2013 that armed jihadis fighting to overthrow Bashar al-Assad in Syria. The deal allowed the Saudis to arm jihadis with US weapons. It also permitted the CIA to train the mercenaries on how to use the weapons, including anti-tank missiles, The New York Times reported.

Scroll down for I-BOOK Table of Contents 'Syria's War for Humanity' by Mark Taliano is part of Global Research's Online Interactive I-Book Series which brings together, in the form of chapters, a collection of Global Research feature articles, including debate and analysis, on a broad theme or subject matter. To consult our Online Interactive I-Book Reader Series, click here. Preface We bring to the attention of our readers Mark Taliano's I-Book entitled Syria's War for Humanity . In contrast to most geopolitical analysts of the Middle East, Mark Taliano focusses on what unites humanity with the people of Syria in their struggle against foreign aggression. Author: Mark Taliano Taliano talks and listens to the people of Syria. He reveals the courage and resilience of a Nation and its people in their day to day lives, after more than five years of US-NATO sponsored terrorism and more than two years of US 'peacemaking' airstrikes which have largely targeted Syria's civilian infrastructure. Everybody in Syria knows that Washington is behind the terrorists, that they are financed by the US (at tax payers expense) and its allies, trained and recruited by America's Middle East partner. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, have been financing and training the ISIS-Daesh, al Nusra terrorists on behalf of the United States. Israel is harboring the terrorists out of the occupied Golan Heights, NATO in liaison with the Turkish high command has since March 2011 been involved in coordinating the recruitment of the jihadist fighters dispatched to Syria. Moreover, the ISIS-Daesh brigades in both Syria and Iraq are integrated by Western special forces and military advisers. While all this is known to the Syrian people, Western public opinion is led to believe that the US is leading a 'counter-terrorism campaign' in Syria and Iraq against the Islamic State (ISIS-Daesh), an entity created and supported by US intelligence. Image: Damascus National Museum, M Chossudovsky, 2011 'Everything that we saw in Syria speaks of humanity's common heritage', says Mark Taliano. Syria is the cradle of civilization, Mesopotamia, the Land of Two Rivers, where the early civilizations of the fertile crescent took their roots. This is what the Washington Neocons want to destroy. But to reach their objective they need to wage a dirty propaganda campaign which conveys the illusion that America is involved in a 'humanitarian' 'peace-making' undertaking. The Syrian people know who the real terrorists are. 'The Western assault on this country is an assault on our common humanity, and an assault on Syria's progressive and forward-looking future', says Taliano. Mark Taliano focusses on the truth as an instrument for building peace and counter-propaganda: 'S hould the West's 'regime change' operations succeed, the secular, pluralist government of President Assad will be replaced by its opposite: a barbaric, sectarian regime, and chaos. Yet Western politicians are seemingly propagandized by their own lies. Or perhaps they see no choice but to cravenly follow diktats from above. Humanity's better nature, however, demands that we all open our eyes, that we learn from history, and that we embrace the rule of international law rather than the diktats of a criminal Empire. Syria and Syrians must be saved, not destroyed.' Currently, my interests lie in digging for political truths in a world that is rushing headlong into war and barbarism, on a bedrock of lies. When I find such truths, their trajectories invariably lead to peace rather than war. So now, my 'crusade' is to help share the truth, to make it broad-based, and to make a positive difference. The dirty war on Syria is such a blatant example of the supremacy of war, deception ‚Äî and evil ‚Äî over civilization, and our common humanity, that my current research interests are defined by what does or does not happen there. If Syria wins, we all win. Right now, she is winning.' Mark Taliano refutes the mainstream media. The causes and consequences of the US-led war on Syria, not to mention the extensive war crimes and atrocities committed by the terrorists on behalf the Western military alliance are routinely obfuscated by the media. Taliano is committed to reversing the tide of media disinformation, by reaching out to Western public opinion on behalf of the Syrian people. 'Syria's stand against the Western agencies of death and destruction is a stand for all of humanity against the dark forces that fester beneath our politicians' empty words and the courtesan media's toxic lies.' 
These twenty-seven chapters of Mark Taliano's Syria's War for Humanity provide an overview of life in Syria, the day to day struggle of the Syrian people to protect and sustain their national sovereignty. 
Michel Chossudovsky, October 30, 2016 * * * Introduction by Mark Taliano I recently traveled to war- torn Syria because I sensed years ago that the official narratives being fed to North Americans across TV screens, in newsprint, and on the internet, were false. The invasion of Libya was based on lies; so was the Iraq war; likewise for Ukraine. All of the 9/11 wars were sold to Western audiences through a sophisticated network of interlocking governing agencies that propagandize both domestic and foreign audiences. But the dirty war on Syria is different. The degree of war propaganda leveled at Syria, and contaminating humanity at this moment, is likely unprecedented. I had already studied and written about Syria for years, so I wasn't entirely surprised by what I saw. But what I felt was a different story. 
First Impressions When I awoke on the first morning of my visit, and sat at a table on the polished marble floor beside the fountain, it was still and quiet. The walls of the hotel courtyard surrounded me ‚Äî rows of hard, dark basalt stone block and intricately carved soft brown stone were woven together with alcoves and archways, all radiating ancient artistry. High vaulted windows overlooked the palazzo, with plants flowing from balconies and the railings of the narrow corridors leading to rooms. Above was the pale blue cloudless morning sky. A pigeon lumbered in and perched inside, sheltered by the ancient walls. A native bird, bluish white, swift and silent, swooped in towards the pigeon, and they were both gone, swept away into the Damascene morning. The quiet returned and the pale blue sky became darker and deeper. Syria will find peace again when this is all over. Syria is an ancient land with a proud and forward looking people. To this ancient and holy land we sent mercenaries, and hatred, and bloodshed, and destruction. We sent strange notions of 'exceptionalism', and waves upon waves of lies. As a visitor I felt shame, but Syrians welcomed me as one of them. This is their story. And these are their voices. 
Testimonies from Syrians 
In this video , Dr. Joseph Saddeh, standing in front of desecrated Christian icons in the ancient and holy city of Maaloula, where Aramaic, the language of Jesus, is still spoken, explains that what happened in Syria was not a 'revolution', and that the terrorists want to destroy everything that is good, and that 'they want to make us like them or they will kill us.' 
The terrorists did invade this ancient and holy place, they did destroy religious icons, and they did kill many people. Terrorist-damaged religious iconography at Maaloula, Syria Former al Nusra Front Headquarters, Maaloula, Syria Syrian soldier Dr. Ali Salem ‚Äì a veterinarian during times of peace ‚Äì explained that terrorists include 'imports' from about 80 countries, street people, thieves, smugglers (diesel fuel and drugs), and those who were forced to fight under the threat of death or the death of family members. 
He said that by now people must understand the truth about what is happening, despite the propaganda that demonizes the Syrian government and its people. The army is the people, he explained, and the government is not a 'regime'. When this is over, he said, young people will have to be taught the truth about what happened. Terrorist-destroyed Shrine of Saint Takla, Maaloula, Syria. Listen to the video here. Religious icons were either destroyed or burned. We met soft-spoken, accommodating, Dr. Ali Haidar at at his office. He had earlier explained to Jamal Daoud, leader of the Third International Tour of Peace to Syria , that in 2011, he was offered a large sum of money from Qatar to boycott a 'consultation summit' with the government. When he refused the bribe, he received threats, and his son was murdered. The process of national reconciliation, headed by Dr. Haidar, is emblematic of Syrian decision-making processes. The externally-orchestrated war is being resolved internally ‚Äì by Syrians, for Syrians ‚Äî and the solutions are often the fruit of a genuine democratic processes, in contrast to the fake democratic processes masquerading as 'democracy' in the West, where Western politicians and citizens are heavily propagandized. 
All Syrians are paying a horrible price for the sins of the West. Ammar recounted this nightmare: 'As everyday morning my sister was going to the university when a bloody Takfiri Salafi Wahhabi suicide bomber blew up bomb car at the bus stop which led to the martyrdom and injury of many civilians and university students who were going to their exams, after 10 minutes another suicide bomber blew up himself at the same place taking advantage of the gathering of people and ambulance teams, usually when a terror attack happens we call all family members and friends to make sure they all are ok but this time no one answered! Then we started looking for her in hospitals ‚Ä¶ the shock was in the bloody views there; many burned bodies and human body parts were on the ground , there i saw my sister a body without soul ‚Ä¶' 
Madj explained his sentiments: 
' I am Syrian‚Ä¶ living in Syria in the middle of everything. We have seen horrors. It was never a revolution nor a civil war. The terrorists are sent by your government. They are al Qaeda Jabhat al Nusra Wahhabi Salafists Talibans etc and the extremist jihadists sent by the West, the Saudis, Qatar and Turkey. Your Obama and whoever is behind him or above him are supporting al Qaeda and leading a proxy war on my country. 
We thought you are against al Qaeda and now you support them. 
The majority here loves Assad. He has never committed a crime against his own people‚Ä¶ The chemical attack was staged by the terrorists helped by the USA and the UK, etc. Everyone knows that here. 
American soldiers and people should not be supporting barbarian al Qaeda terrorists who are killing Christians, Muslims in my country and everyone. 
Every massacre is committed by them. We were all happy in Syria: we had free school and university education available for everyone, free healthcare, no GMO, no fluoride, no chemtrails, no Rothschild IMF- controlled bank, state owned central bank which gives 11% interest, we are self-sufficient and have no foreign debt to any country or bank. 
Life before the crisis was so beautiful here. Now it is hard and horrific in some regions. 
I do not understand how the good and brave American people can accept to bomb my country which has never harmed them and therefore help the barbarian al Qaeda. These animals slit throats and behead for pleasure‚Ä¶ they behead babies and rape young kids. 
They are satanic. Our military helped by the millions of civilian militias are winning the battle against al Qaeda. But now the USA wants to bomb the shit out of us so that al Qaeda can get the upper hand. 
Please help us American people. They are destroying the cradle of civilization. Stop your government. 
Impeach that bankster puppet you have as president‚Ä¶ support Ron Paul or Rand Paul (as Libertarians they have opposed foreign interventions‚ÄîEditors) or anyone the like who are true American patriots. but be sure of one.thing‚Ä¶if they attack and I think they will‚Ä¶.it will be hell. 
Be sure that if it were to be a world war, many many will die. Syria can and will defend itself and will sink many US ships. Iran will go to war..Russia and China eventually if it escalates‚Ä¶ and all this for what ? For the elites who created al Qaeda through the US government and use it to conduct proxy wars and destabilize countries which do not go along with their new world order agenda !!? 
American people‚Ä¶you gotta regain control of your once admirable country. Now everyone hates you for the death you bring almost everywhere. 
Ask the Iraqis‚Ä¶the Afghans‚Ä¶the Pakistanis‚Ä¶the Palestinians‚Ä¶the Syrians‚Ä¶the Macedonians and Serbs‚Ä¶the Libyans‚Ä¶the Somalis‚Ä¶the Yemenis ‚Ä¶.all the ones you kill with drones everyday. Stop your wars. Enough wars. Use diplomacy‚Ä¶dialogue‚Ä¶help‚Ä¶not force.' Jad also shared his tragedy. He told me that his brother was kidnapped last year, and that the terrorists tortured him and destroyed his knees. Now he can't walk. He also told me that his cousin, who was serving in the Syrian Arab Army, lost his leg when Wahhabi suicide bombers attacked his military vehicle, and that another cousin was kidnapped in 2012, and remains in captivity. The tragedies are legion, but all of the Syrians to whom I spoke assured me that they support the government of Bashar Al-Assad. They are unified in the battle against Western terrorists. The sanctions, the terrorists, the death and destruction, are not working. The alternative, a Western-installed Wahhabi stooge government, is not an attractive option. The ongoing dirty war on Syria is particularly odious because the elected President of Syria, Dr. Bashar Al-Assad, and his wife, represent the best of what Syria's future promises to be. The Assads are well-educated ‚Äì like all of the Syrians whom I had the pleasure of meeting ‚Äì and they are moving ancient, holy Syria into a better future than that promised by the uni-polar, 'exceptional' imperialists who are trying to destroy Syria with their Wahhabi-inspired terrorists. 
Syrians have seen the devastation of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, and the Ukraine. They refuse to be the next domino. Syria's future will include the rule of international law, nation-state sovereignty, self-determination, pluralism, respect for all people, and multi-polar geo-political relationships. Syria has strong institutions, strong people, a strong military, strong allies, and a strong government; and she will not be pulled into the abyss of terrorism like the other aforementioned countries. 
For this we should all be grateful. 
We have just witnessed the pain and hardship that Syria and Syrians are enduring. The next question is, How did the West arrive at the point where otherwise intelligent and morally upright citizens support the illegality and barbarity of their nations' foreign policies? The simple answer is that the collective mindset of the public has been contaminated by an unprecedented and on-going propaganda campaign that engineers consent for unspeakable crimes that 'benefit' transnational elites and impoverish the rest of us. [This is the longstanding nature of US foreign policy, dating back more than a century, even prior to the Civil War, when early imperialist and 'Manifest Destiny' believer James Polk seized half of Mexico under trumped-up pretexts and false flags. Meanwhile, the American media have always supported these international crimes, as they do today.‚ÄîEditors.] The dreadful reality is that the Global War on Terror is actually a global war for terror. The foreign policies of Western nations are increasing the reach of terrorism exponentially, because the West uses these terror brigades as foot soldiers for illegal wars of aggression. In its Syrian campaign, as with its previous Libyan campaign, the West is literally the air force for the terrorists on the ground. This is all well documented with Western sources. US-led NATO is aligned with the Gulf Monarchies, and Israel, to flood Syria with mercenary terrorists, to balkanize and destroy the country, and to remove President Assad, so that it can advance its agenda for a New World Order of conquest under the false banner of the Global War On Terror (GWOT). Through its actions and inactions, its sanctions, its arms dealings, and its pre-planned invasions, the West and the terrorists in Syria are one and the same. We support all the imaginary 'moderates', and every other terrorist organization operating in Syria. Again, the evidence is ample, and well-documented using western sources. US-led NATO is aligned with the Gulf Monarchies, and Israel, to flood Syria with mercenary terrorists, to balkanize and destroy the country, and to remove President Assad, so that it can advance its agenda for a New World Order of conquest under the false banner of the Global War On Terror (GWOT). This on-going project necessarily entails death, destruction, and wide-spread poverty. Neo-con planners hope that the widespread destruction will enable them to control destroyed countries and open them up for predatory and parasitical economic programs ‚Äî similar to domestic neoliberal economic models that are ravaging domestic economies beneath the lies and diversions. Despotic stooge puppet regimes are easier to control and manipulate than independent sovereign governments that represent the democratic will of their peoples and the rule of international law. Again, this favoured totalitarian style rule is mirrored at home, but more subtly. The notion that we live in democracies is absurd. 
Tentacles of predatory neoliberal capitalism have yet to invade Syria's famous souks/markets Spices at the Souk F alse flag terrorism is part of the apparatus of deception which serves to advance policies that are contrary to the wishes of those who are deceived.
There's nothing new about 'synthetic terrorism'; it is military doctrine, and examples of its use are legion, but it is a taboo topic and a 'conspiracy theory', so it works. 
The Canada Day pressure-cooker bomber plot was a proven false flag (though not acknowledged as such by mainstream media), and it served the apparatus of deception as did other domestic terrorism cases. 
Even if the Ottawa shooting crisis unfolded exactly as the official narratives described it, the conflation between the shooting and ISIS is surely unfounded, as noted by Senator Mobina Jaffer. 
But the accumulated impact of these events, coupled with largely unquestioned official narratives, has the intended effect of creating a consensus of ignorance wherein otherwise intelligent people support illegal warfare, terrorism, and police state legislation. 
Preeminent Constitutional lawyer Rocco Galati assesses Canada's C-51 legislation in these words : 
It takes all our private information and shares it with all government agencies, including foreign government. For some citizens that becomes an eventuality of torture and/or death when travelling abroad. 
It restricts arbitrarily who can travel. 
Freedom of expression and political criticism with respect to 'terrorism and the government's role' (becomes) a terrorist offence in itself. So words and thoughts become an act of terrorism under this bill. 
It allows CSIS to disrupt covertly constitutionally-protected rights of association, expression, and protest. 
It does all of this by taking away all and any transparent judicial oversight. 
He says that 'We've entered into the final fascist state.' 
Consequently, both domestically and abroad, we are living what author Naomi Wolf describes as a 'fascist shift' , wherein we unwittingly embrace our own enslavement, global war, and poverty, all for the 'benefit' of transnational oligarch classes, and the known catastrophic impacts for humanity. 
Syria is standing strong against these Western cancers of ignorance and evil. She, and her allies, are swooping down on these globalist interlopers. Her victory will be our victory. 
Outline of This Book T he purpose of this book is to shed some light on how the propaganda works, and to decode it and other events, so that we can arrive at a better understanding of what is really happening in Syria, and why.
The degree of war propaganda leveled at Syria, and contaminating humanity at this moment is unprecedented. 
I have yet to meet a single Syrian who would prefer a stooge, Wahhabi dictatorship to the current government. Every single Syrian opposition leader prefers the current government to an imperial -imposed government. The on-going campaign of lies directed at Syria is particularly odious because the elected President of Syria, Dr. Bashar Al-Assad, and his wife, represent the best of what Syria's future promises to be. 
The Assads are well-educated ‚Äì like all of the Syrians whom I had the pleasure of meeting ‚Äì and they are moving ancient, holy Syria into a better future than that promised by the uni-polar, 'exceptional' imperialists who are trying to destroy Syria with their Wahhabi-inspired terrorists. 
Syrians have seen the devastation of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, and the Ukraine. They refuse to be the next domino. 
Syrians are unified. Their future will include the rule of international law, nation-state sovereignty, self-determination, pluralism, respect for all people, and multi-polar geo-political relationships. Syria has strong institutions, strong people, a strong military, strong allies, and a strong government; she will not be pulled into the abyss of terrorism like the other aforementioned countries. 
For this we should all be grateful. 
The compilation of articles in this book decode the propaganda apparatus which creates an engineered consensus that serves the covert agenda of expanding the parasitical economic model called 'neoliberalism'. 
Neoliberalism impoverishes domestic and foreign populations, and enriches a transnational oligarch class. The transnational oligarch class ‚Äî enriched by 'deregulation', 'privatization' schemes, and 'free trade' agreements ‚Äî contaminates the collective mindset of humanity with its foundations, its lobbying, and its undue influence, so its real nature, and its very existence, remains hidden. Rarely will a mainstream publication even use the word 'neoliberalism', which is the economic foundation of the current class system. 
Part One is the story of Syria as told by Syrians, unfiltered by mainstream media (MSM) propaganda. We see and hear the trauma lived by defiant, heroic Syrians, and we discover that this ancient, holy land will surely survive the current barbarian invasion, and will rise again as a beacon of civilization, hope, and dignity, in contrast to so many of those countries that seek to destroy it. 
Voices from Syrian citizens are absent from mainstream media stories. Syrians are like you and me. This is what they have to say: 
'We thought you are against al Qaeda and now you support them.' I Am A Syrian Living in Syria: 'It was Never a Revolution nor a Civil War. The Terrorists are sent by your Government' 
The externally-orchestrated war is being resolved internally ‚Äì by Syrians, for Syrians ‚Äî and the solutions are often the fruit of a genuine democratic processes, in contrast to the fake democratic processes masquerading as 'democracy' in the West, where Western politicians and citizens are heavily propagandized. 
NATO et al. terrorists destroy everything that contradicts their deviant ideology. They seek a 'blank slate' that denies and negates the real Syria. 
Syria insists on being a sovereign nation; it refuses Empire's head-chopping criminality. 
'Syria was prosperous, with a growing economy. It had food sovereignty, with a 'strategic' stock of millions of tons of high quality wheat , not the 'Franken-food' bio-tech variety; it had a strong central bank with no usurious IMF loans ; it had a popular, reformer President; it had a mostly well-educated, secular, pluralist, forward-looking population; and it was the fourth safest country in the world.' 
Part Two elaborates upon the real story about Syria, and the drivers behind the current dirty war, in which the U.S-led Empire is using terror proxies to advance its predatory reach, contrary to the wishes of the vast majority of Syrians. 
The alternative to Syria's elected government is genocidal despotism and Sharia law. The (non-existent) 'moderates' can't be separated from the 'extremists', because all of the mercenary terrorists share the same goals and the same ideologies. 
The predictable result of engineered deception is that domestic Western populations remain deceived and politically passive. The truth is inverted, and large swaths of the population remain deluded. Whereas the West and its allies support all the terrorists invading Syria, domestic populations think that we are fighting terrorism. This is the great fraud of the 'Global War On Terror'. 
The West uses mercenary terrorist proxies to advance its predatory reach; to destroy foreign countries; and to increase global terrorism exponentially, all for the benefit of the oligarch classes. There is nothing new about this. 
'The secular governments of Iraq, Libya, and Syria all ‚Äî prior to Western invasions ‚Äî opposed terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda.' Dedication 
This book is dedicated to the people of Syria, all of whom are on the front lines in the fight against international terrorism. 
Your blood is being shed for our sins.

ARTICLE

[Photo: Jorge Lascar's photo of the Great Wall of China] =By= Vasily Kashin Editor's Note The relationship between China and the United States has a very long history. Regardless of whatever might that the U.S. has had at a given point, the sheer power to accomplish the amazing cannot be denied ‚Äì starting with the most incredible 'border fence' of all time, The Great Wall of China. China has been seen as a provider of labor for centuries, from imported labor to build yet another great project, this one in the US, the transcontinental railroad, to an in situ labor force for the world. China was feared because of the number of soldiers they could use to flood and control the US, to a subservient labor force, and now as a head to head competitor for dominance of the world. 
U.S.- Chinese relations are 'the most important bilateral relations in the 21st century,' as Chinese politicians and scholars like to emphasize. Gradually, they have become a central, if not the main, narrative in world politics. Various things, ranging from Russia's foreign policy to the situation in regions that are distant from Asia, depend on the future vector of these relations. Now, however, relations between China and the United States are going through hard times, prompting the question: How far will their disagreements go? In answering this question, it is worth recalling why the U.S. and China began to cooperate years ago, what objectives they pursued, and what results they have achieved. Fighting Communism P rerequisites for cooperation between the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the United States emerged even before the CPC took power in China in 1949. There is information that Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong sought to establish cooperation, even though limited, with the United States when he was still at his 'revolutionary base' in Yan'an. During World War II, Chinese communists had regular contacts with U.S. political and military officials in China. In 1944, the U.S. established the Army Observation Group, commonly known as the Dixie Mission, in Yan'an. Such an approach to the United States was natural for the Chinese Communist Party, regardless of how radical its doctrines were at that time. Mao was, above all, a Chinese nationalist who saw communism as a way to restore the greatness of his country. His dependence on the Soviet Union irked him (and he shook off this dependence as soon as he could). This is why his desire to conduct a multivector policy was logical and inevitable.
Many experienced American Sinologists, both military and civilian, reasonably spoke of certain prospects for cooperation with Chinese communists already at that time. The regime established by the president of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek, was weak, corrupt and inefficient. Its stability was in doubt, and it systematically misused American economic and military aid. At the same time, U.S. experts were well aware of Mao's desire to get out of Moscow's shadow. A group of renowned State Department officers, known as China Hands, praised merits of Chinese communists, their effective organization, discipline and non-corruptness, as well as their willingness to make bargains with the United States. 
Their point of view was supported by some prominent military leaders in the U.S., including General Joseph Stilwell. But they were opposed by a group of anti-communist dogmatists led by Patrick Hurley, U.S. ambassador to China in the last years of World War II, who completely fell under the influence of the Chinese president's family. One would think that after the communist victory on the mainland in 1949 and the expulsion of Kuomintang supporters to Taiwan, a choice in favor of cooperation with Mao was obvious. But that did not happen. After the communist victory in China, the U.S. government made no sober analysis of the new situation. The United States was seized by panic, which fueled McCarthyism. This panic blended well with effective lobbying efforts by Chiang Kai-shek and his wife Soong Mei-ling, who assigned a key role to contacts with conservative religious groups in the U.S. (both were Methodists). 
The result was a sweeping personnel purge, paradoxical for a developed democratic country, which involved security agencies, and the establishment of an atmosphere of suspicion and self-censorship in the field of foreign policy. The China Hands and scholars, intelligence officers and journalists who were close to the group became targets of harassment. Sometimes, even their forecasts that had become true were used as grounds for accusation. For example, John Davies, a political attach√© to Stilwell and one of the organizers of the Dixie Mission, predicted that communists would win in the Chinese Civil War. He was accused of sympathizing with them and fired from the State Department. After the dismissal, Davies went to Peru where he ran a furniture business. 
Even interference by the judicial authorities was not enough to remedy the situation and protect victims of the ideological campaign. Another prominent diplomat and Sinologist, John Service, who met with Mao in Yan'an, was fired from the State Department but was later reinstated by the Supreme Court. Yet he was assigned to head the U.S. Consulate in Liverpool without holding a diplomatic rank. 
Developments in Washington's China policy in the 1950s, influenced by the so-called 'China lobby' formed by Chiang Kai-shek, shaped Sino-American relations until the end of the 1960s. The U.S. policy in the Far East was dogmatized and privatized by a small group of professional ideologists and lobbyists. Chiang successfully sold Americans a myth about a 'communist threat' until the 1970s, and many people in the United States were interested in buying it. Expressing alternative points of view was dangerous. Those times have a strong association with modern Russian-American relations. 
The U.S. and its allies paid a high price for this policy‚Äîthey paid with their political interests, territories, economic losses and thousands of lives. China, which turned into an implacable enemy of the Western world, fought against UN forces in Korea and played an important role in France's defeat in Indochina and, later, in the U.S. defeat in Vietnam. Even the obvious breakup in Sino-Soviet relations in 1960 did not lead to immediate changes in the U.S. position. Only the disappointing course of the Cold War and the bogging down in the Vietnam trap made the United States seek a dialogue with Beijing in the late 1960s. The long-overdue and forced moves by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, which resolutely cancelled out the previous 20 years of America's East Asia policy, brought about a major, albeit belated, victory for the U.S. in the Cold War. A Rapprochement Against Russia 
China's becoming a U.S. partner in the anti-Soviet coalition was the worst foreign-policy disaster for Moscow over the entire period of its global rivalry with the United States. The Soviet Union and its Communist Party saw their influence on many left-wing and national liberation movements in the Third World waning, and faced a new active and influential opponent, which later won a seat on the UN Security Council. Moscow had to deploy a large military force of hundreds of thousands of people in the Siberian and Far Eastern taiga and provide them with housing and infrastructure, which overstrained the Soviet economy. China played a key role in arming Afghan mujahideen, who fought against Soviet troops, with simple and effective Soviet-designed small arms and light weapons. Soviet aviation in Afghanistan suffered the greatest losses not from the much-touted American Stinger man-portable air defense system but from DShKM heavy machine guns, manufactured in China under the Soviet license. 
However, the years 1988 and 1989 brought about major changes that eliminated basic prerequisites for the U.S.-China partnership on the old, anti-Soviet basis. The Cold War was over; Soviet troops were withdrawn from Afghanistan, and Vietnam began to pull out its troops from Cambodia; and the Soviet Union and China finally normalized their relations during Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to Beijing in 1989. At the same time, the suppression of the protests in Tiananmen Square by the Chinese leadership clearly demonstrated that the Chinese communists did not intend to follow in the footsteps of their Soviet and Eastern European colleagues and launch democratic reforms. 
Sino-U.S. relations entered a period of crisis. After the 1989 crackdown, the West imposed economic and technological sanctions on China, some of which (for example, the arms embargo) have not been lifted by the U.S. and its allies to this day. Some Congress members called for a full revision of relations with Beijing or, at least, for their linkage to human rights in China. In 1993, President Clinton signed an order to extend most-favored nation trade privileges to China but tied it to progress on human rights issues. However, the order was never fulfilled. 
The two countries preserved and developed their mutual relations on the basis of two major factors‚Äîeconomic and ideological. By 1990, their mutual trade had reached $20 billion and had been growing by tens of percentage points a year. Foreign direct investment in China stood at $6.6 billion a year. Obviously, international companies saw China as a promising huge market and an advantageous area for production location. 
The Chinese government gave serious consideration to the influence of U.S. businesses on politics and paid special attention to ties with business circles. If necessary, it made large-scale one-time purchases of U.S. products, such as civilian aircraft, executive cars, or industrial equipment. By the time the Soviet Union broke up, there were many active and interested supporters of cooperation with China in the United States, who expressed their opinions to Congress and the president. Anticipating Regeneration 
From an ideological point of view, after the collapse of the Soviet bloc, authoritarian communist regimes ceased to be perceived as serious opponents. The transformation and, later, complete regeneration or fall of these regimes and their transition to liberal democracy was believed to be predetermined. Back in the 1980s, the Chinese reforms evoked widespread hope in the U.S. that the communist system in China would gradually disintegrate and that even at that moment it was on the verge of collapse and rebirth (President Ronald Reagan liked to refer to that country as 'so-called Communist China'). 
The events of 1989 only slightly shook this confidence but they did not undermine it. Moreover, it was believed that the Chinese authorities were aware of the inevitability of changes in favor of a liberal model and that they only sought to make it controllable. For ideological reasons, Washington traditionally ignored clear and unambiguous wordings of Chinese Communist Party documents about the inadmissibility of 'liberal rebirth,' the increased control over the media and public life, changes in the defense policy and other 'inconvenient facts.' President Bill Clinton wrote in his book My Life in 1998 about his Chinese counterpart: 'The more time I spent with Jiang, the more I liked him. [‚Ä¶] Even though I didn't always agree with him, I became convinced that he believed he was changing China as fast as he could, and in the right direction.' 
The spread of the Internet in the 1990s was accompanied by over-inflated, romantic expectations and this strengthened the illusion of an inevitable and imminent rebirth of the Chinese regime. It was believed that the Chinese Communist Party's power was incompatible with the free movement of information in the global network. Mainstream views on an inevitable regeneration of the Chinese state were set out, for example, in Clinton's speech in Congress in March 2000, in which he advocated granting China permanent normal trade relations status. 
'In the new century, liberty will spread by cell phone and cable modem,' the U.S. president said. 'In the past year, the number of Internet addresses in China has more than quadrupled from 2 million to 9 million. [‚Ä¶] Now, there's no question China has been trying to crack down on the Internet‚Äîgood luck. That's sort of like trying to nail Jello to the wall. [‚Ä¶] In the knowledge economy, economic innovation and political empowerment, whether anyone likes it or not, will inevitably go hand in hand.' 
Today, it is an established fact that the Chinese government has created an effective system of control over the Internet and, moreover, it successfully uses new information technologies in its own interests. Clinton in 2000 mentioned a cell phone as one of the instruments of liberalization. In 2015, the Xinhua News Agency published an interesting article saying that the Political Work Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army began to download special applications to Chinese soldiers' smartphones with ideological materials‚Äîtexts by Mao and classics of Marxism-Leninism and tests. 
China is one of the strongest powers in the world in computer espionage, computer security and the use of the Internet for resolving political tasks. New technologies have not undermined the system; rather, they have strengthened it and expanded capabilities for propaganda and control. 
The United States has never, not for a single moment, been ready to put up with the existence of China the way it is, with its one-party political system led by the CPC. From the late 1960s and until the first achievements of Deng Xiaoping's reforms, Washington's China policy was based on the need to restore balance with the Soviet Union at all costs after a series of major setbacks. Later, especially after the collapse of communism in Europe, this policy was based on a holistic dogmatic worldview, which prevailed in the U.S. and which suggested that the Chinese regime was to undergo (or already was undergoing) a transformation and establish a liberal capitalist order‚Äîsimply as an inevitable consequence of its economic development and modernization. 
Until this transformation was over, it was planned to contain China in areas where its actions would interfere with U.S. interests. It was believed that this containment would not take too much effort, as China would become transformed long before it could pose a serious problem. 
China's efforts to restore and build up its military power came under close scrutiny since the second half of the 1990s. In 2000, U.S. Congress asked the Pentagon to provide annual reports on China's military power. Yet, until the late 2000s, the West was largely derisive about China's military buildup efforts. It thought China was incapable of creating a high-tech industry and powerful armed forces within a reasonable time. Also, the West underestimated the future rate of China's economic expansion to Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, the growth of China's political influence, and the enlargement of the area of its interests. 
The Chinese leadership was well aware of this situation and supported Washington's illusions in every way. Beijing had different political rhetoric for domestic and foreign consumption. The country strictly abided by Deng Xiaoping's temporarily passive foreign policy ('conceal your true potential') and kept a low profile in world affairs. Liberal economists and political analysts that advocated cautious reforms and cooperation with the West were favored by the government. Beijing redoubled efforts to build a network of ties with major American businesses and politicians. Sometimes these efforts were ridiculous. According to testimony given by Clinton's election campaign fundraiser Johnny Chung and published in the late 1990s, General Ji Shengde, the head of China's military intelligence, met with Chung in Macau in August 1996 and provided him with $300,000 for Clinton's re-election campaign. 
Naturally, China did undergo a major social and political transformation, but over time the vector of this transformation began to veer off from the American expectations. The Chinese transformation has nothing to do with what was happening in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s-1990s. Rather, it is similar to what happened in Western Europe in the 19th century, or in Russia and Japan in the late 19th/mid-20th century. The industrialization and economic breakthrough inevitably led to a generation gap, changes in the age-old way of life and family values, economic inequality, and radicalism. Gradually, internal conflicts came to a head, and society felt the need for a 'strong hand.' These tendencies were coupled with euphoria over the country's economic and industrial progress, the rise of nationalism, the feeling of exceptionalism, and interest in one's roots. 
One can definitely speak of a symbiosis of the state bureaucracy and big business, which needs to move into international markets, severe social stratification and conflicts caused by it, and the domination of leftist and nationalist ideas in public discussions, although there is a small pro-Western liberal group of 'public intellectuals,' who do not have broad support. Internal problems are coupled with a desire for national revenge for the shock and humiliation experienced by the Chinese nation in the period from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century. China's modern ideology and culture are largely built on the comprehension and experience of this trauma. Xi Jinping even delivered his policy speech about 'the Chinese dream,' understood as the rejuvenation and rebirth of the Chinese nation, when he visited a National Museum of China exhibition devoted to China's recovery from the 'century of humiliation.' 
The militarization of politics and the growing popularity of radical ideas is another indication that the political development of China, where more than 80 percent of the population lived in villages in 1980, is now at a stage where major European countries and Japan were 100 to 150 years ago. Political reforms conducted in such conditions can and, most likely, should be accompanied by the introduction of individual democratic institutions, but in terms of content they will be a far cry from those of Western liberal democracies of today, just as elective institutions in present-day Iran are. 
Mankind's historical experience shows that a country can exist in such a state and even quickly develop technologically for an indefinitely long time, for decades, at least. European empires and the Empire of Japan ceased to exist not as a result of a smooth and natural regeneration but after world wars which led to the disintegration of states or foreign occupation for losing nations, or to a catastrophic overstrain for the winners. In the nuclear age, the threat of such wars has decreased. In addition, the maintenance of the nuclear shield upon its completion does not cost much (spending on the Strategic Missile Forces in Russia is less than ten percent of the national defense budget). This factor allows the country to ensure its military invulnerability, while avoiding economic overstrain and pursuing a reasonable (that is, not Soviet) defense policy. 
The destabilization of the ruling regime is quite possible in such circumstances, but it is hard to see how it can lead to the establishment of liberal democracy. There is information indicating that there is a great potential of discontent in Chinese society, but the demand for equality and social justice, as well as nationalism, matters much more to the population than political liberties. In a hypothetical 'post-revolutionary' China, the People's Liberation Army command, functionaries of the present CPC, and the management of state-owned companies will be much stronger than progressive professors and high-profile journalists of the business media. 
Meanwhile, China has already become an economic superpower and a great military power. The China factor has completely changed the system of relations between suppliers and buyers of natural resources, certainly not in favor of the latter. The emergence of the new market and source of investment and technologies as an alternative to the West has instilled more confidence in the ruling regimes of developing countries that export resources and cheap labor. Some countries already can be viewed as China's 'clients,' for example, Cambodia and Laos in Southeast Asia. Partnership with China has strengthened the position of Thailand's military government leaders who carried out a coup in the country, condemned by the United States. 
China is now the world's third military and military-industrial power after the U.S. and Russia. Moreover, in some key aspects of military power, China is already ahead of Russia and has incomparably greater reserves for building up its military potential. China's foreign policy began to change in 2013, becoming increasingly active and offensive, especially on strategic issues that are important to China (the South China Sea). In 2015, the country built its first overseas military base. Deng's passive foreign policy is slowly receding into the past. 
Meanwhile, prospects for China's 'transformation' are becoming increasingly dim. The country's economic development model began to change in the late 2000s, but those changes were slow and often belated. After Xi came to power, economic changes began to be accompanied by more obvious changes in the political model, which involved sweeping anti-corruption purges in the government and the army, unprecedented centralization of power, the establishment of strict control over the media and society, and policy tightening with regard to Western organizations operating in the country. Giving Up Illusions 
In March 2015, The Wall Street Journal published an article, 'The Coming Chinese Crackup,' by U.S. Sinologist David Shambaugh, which can be viewed as a landmark in the American comprehension of the situation in China. The author debunks and rejects the theory of China's 'transformation.' He insists that the Xi-led regime is moving in the wrong direction, in contrast to the times of Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, when the desired transformation did take place. Shambaugh concludes that the collapse of the regime is the only possible outcome for it. 'Its demise is likely to be protracted, messy and violent,' he writes, adding that the endgame of Chinese communist rule 'has progressed further than many think.' To substantiate his conclusions, the author draws parallels with the Soviet Union, which seems strange considering that the Soviet Union and present-day China are absolute opposites in terms of culture, politics and economy. The only things they had in common were 'the absence of democracy' and the word 'communist' in the names of their ruling parties. 
Anyway, the belief that China will inevitably, gradually and relatively painlessly transform into a loyal member of the U.S.-led world order has been relegated to the periphery of the discussion. The incumbent regime has been given an unambiguous assessment, and its collapse (preferably, an early one) has been predicted. However, no one knows when this will happen. 
Doubts about the possibility of China's rapid transformation began to take root back in the late 1990s-early 2000s, but the 9/11 events temporarily shifted the focus of U.S. policy towards the Middle East. China received a strategic respite, which lasted until the Obama administration proclaimed a 'pivot to Asia.' Some Chinese analysts expected that the events in Ukraine would give China another respite, but the South China Sea situation has shown that they were wrong. The Ukrainian situation has stabilized and left the global agenda, whereas the situation in the Western Pacific is attracting more and more attention. 
The scope of China's containment is broadening, while the scope of U.S.-China cooperation is gradually narrowing. Of course, it is easy not to see this if one cites high volumes of U.S.-Chinese trade or the great enthusiasm for American popular culture among the Chinese. Usually, these factors are mentioned to show that U.S.-China relations are very close and productive, while elements of rivalry in these relations are secondary. Both arguments, economic and cultural, have been disproved so many times by history that it is strange that they are still in use. 
In the 1920s and early 1930s, Japan's main trading partners were the United States, the British Empire, China, and the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia)‚Äîprecisely the countries that Japan later attacked. Japan owed its rise to its long (until the 1920s) economic and industrial partnership with Britain; even the Japanese battleships that destroyed the Russian fleet at the Battle of Tsushima were built in British shipyards. In contrast, Germany and Italy, Japan's allies during World War II, did not play a significant role in Japan's trade in prewar years. The British Empire and France were major trading partners of Germany before both world wars. Germany was the largest economic partner of Russia before the First World War; it accounted for half of Russia's imports and was its major source of technologies and investment. 
The present U.S. soft power is a mere apology for the soft power of France in the 18th-early 19th century. There were times when the aristocracies of many European countries spoke French. For years, France was the only trendsetter in fashion and arts, and traces of those times can still be seen today in the Russian language. As we know, this universal love of France did not save it. Russian francophone aristocrats brought Bashkir cavalry regiments to Paris. The First World War was fought among European empires, whose ruling dynasties and leading families were connected by ties of blood. Great Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, who masterminded the attack on Pearl Harbor, was quite an Americanophile, because he studied in the United States and worked there for many years. Many educated Japanese in those times were strongly influenced by English and American culture. 
Confrontation between the two giants of the contemporary world will grow slowly, of course. Conflicts among European empires before World War I grew slowly, too. The United States and China will continue to develop their mutual trade and cooperation in various fields. Over a century ago, more than two decades passed from the formation of the Franco-Russian alliance of 1891 to an open clash among the great powers in WWI. During all those years, numerous statements kept emphasizing that a direct conflict among the great powers was impossible in 'our civilized age of trade, investment and progress.'

Moshen Abdelmoumen Interviews Ann Garrison Editor's Note Mohsen Abdelmoumen is a journalist who writes for The American Herald Tribune, and has his own blog, Alg√©rie R√©sistance. In this interview he queries Ann Garrison about American democracy, and Hillary Clinton. 
Mohsen Abdelmoumen: Do you think the United States can claim to be democratic simply by electing a woman president? Also, what are your thoughts about the status of democracy in the USA with a candidate like Hillary Clinton who caters to the financial lobbies and AIPAC? 
Ann Garrison: In response to the first question, no, of course not. No more than we could claim to be a democracy because we elected a Black president. These two elections signify nothing more than the inclusion of previously excluded classes of people in the super elite. The United States is an oligarchy of the .01%, 1% of the 1%. Any president who is not already among the .01%, like Bill Clinton, becomes part of the .01% by serving its interests and then peddling influence after leaving office. No one has developed an influence peddling machine as well-oiled as the Clintons, with Bill working the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative while Hillary was Secretary of State. Just imagine the new depths of corruption that the next eight years and beyond could bring. Obama has said he's now considering a move from the White House to venture capitalism that has Silicon Valley slathering at the opportunity. 
Every four years Americans are given the illusion of choice between oligarchs and/or aspiring oligarchs who will serve the interests of oligarchy. Candidates who aspire to actually represent the interests of the people are marginalized by the corporate media and the pay-to-play campaign contributions of the oligarchs. 
In municipal and county elections and ballot measures, Americans often do have real choices, but the higher and more powerful the office, the greater the corruption and oligarchic control. Nevertheless, only a small minority of Americans actually vote n local elections; The Atlantic's CityLab reporting project recently concluded that fewer than 20% vote in mayoral elections in 15 of the 30 most populous cites. Disengagement is one of the most fundamental facts of American political life. 
Regarding federal elections, this concept of democracy within the largest, most lethal military power the world has ever seen is bogus to begin with. When U.S. citizens cast ballots to elect a new commander-in-chief who will continue the project of perpetual war, military industrial profits, and global hegemony, how democratic is that? The vast majority of those who will suffer and die don't get to vote; the only exceptions are members of the U.S. Armed Services who die in U.S. wars. If those on the other side of the Pentagon's crosshairs were able to vote, I'm sure they would elect our Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who said, 'We say to Trump, we don't need no friggin' wall! We just need to stop invading other countries.' Her running mate, vice presidential candidate Ajamu Baraka has called the humanitarian interventionist argument a new version of the white man's burden and said, 'You have to ask yourself, when was the last time the U.S. has been on the side of the people? And the answer is: NEVER. ' 
How do you explain the dynastic governance of the Clintons? Is this the American dream in all its glory? 
I'm not sure I can explain the Clinton dynasty except to agree that it is one. Chelsea has been very involved in the Clinton Foundation and is quite likely to enter political life and even run for president one day. We have had other political dynasties, most notably the Roosevelts, the Kennedys and the Bushes, and there are many lower level dynasties, like the Browns in California. Jerry Brown, the current governor of California, is the son of former California governor Pat Brown. New York State has the Cuomos; Governor Andrew Cuomo is the son of former Governor Mario Cuomo, and his brother Chris Cuomo is a prominent corporate television host. 
Regarding the American dream, I assume you're referring to the dream that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can achieve some proportionate degree of status, security and prosperity. If so, the Clintons certainly aren't living the American dream because, although they did well in school, they've hardly played by the rules. They've enriched themselves with that well-oiled influence peddling operation I mentioned earlier, the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative. We're all wondering whether Hillary Clinton, and maybe even Bill Clinton, might finally be indicted now that the FBI has reopened its investigation of Clinton e-mail because more of it was discovered on the laptop that Anthony Weiner ‚Äì a former Congressman under FBI investigation for sex offense ‚Äì shared with his wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin. If Hillary Clinton is elected, she'll have to be impeached, convicted and removed from office, but that's extremely unlikely ‚Äì no matter what's in the newly discovered e-mail ‚Äì if her party, the Democrats, win a majority in the House and more than a one- third minority in the Senate. It takes a majority in the House to impeach a president and a two-thirds majority in the Senate to then convict and remove a president. So Hillary Clinton is at a Berlusconi moment in her sordid career; her best chance of avoiding indictment is getting elected. Getting back to the American dream that you can get ahead by working hard and playing by the rules, Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, for perjury and obstruction of justice regarding his affair with a 19-year-old White House intern and his testimony in a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by another former employee. However, his own party held a majority in the Senate and they acquitted him. This was all legal, according to the U.S. Constitution, but does it really sound like he was 'playing by the rules'? During the final days of his presidency, Clinton acquitted Glencore International founder Mark Rich, an international fugitive who had fled to Switzerland. His ex-wife had donated to the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton Presidential Library and Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign. 
According to the law, President Clinton had the authority to acquit Rich, but how would any rational person consider that anything but bribery and corruption? 
In 2006, Clinton polished the reputation of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan's autocratic leader and human rights offender, who then gave a uranium mining lease to Canadian businessman Frank Giustra's Shell Company, making it worth tens of millions of dollars overnight. Giustra then made a big contribution to the Clinton Foundation. No one has claimed that this was illegal, but is it 'playing by the rules'? 
When Guistra sold a majority stake in his company, Uranium One, to Rosatom, the Russian atomic energy agency, it was approved by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Giustra then contributed $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton was offered a $500,000 speaking engagement with a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin. Does that sound like playing by the rules? And now Hillary's trying to make us believe that Russia's meddling in our elections and threatening confrontation with Russia over Syria. I don't think she's kidding about the confrontation, but the Clinton Foundation rarely passes up the chance to make another million dollars or more in any circumstances. 
Meanwhile, most of the rest of us are not living the American dream. Sixty-three percent of Americans are living on the edge of financial catastrophe, unable to handle a $500 car repair or a $1000 emergency room bill . The Clintons, as I said, serve the oligarchy they have also managed to join. When Bill Clinton was on his way out, in the last months of his presidency, he worked with Republicans in the lame duck Congress to deregulate the banking industry. By 2008, its dishonest, excessive and abusive financialization scams had crashed the economy, costing millions of Americans their jobs and/or homes. Then, as a New York Senator, Hillary Clinton voted to bail out the big banks who committed the crime while many of the rest of us struggled in the crash's wake. 
How do you explain that candidate Clinton, with all the negative baggage she brings (the death of the US Ambassador in Libya, her rumored health problems, the scandal of emails, etc) is the Democratic candidate? 
Again, Clinton serves the interests of the oligarchy that she herself has joined. Many people believe that the nomination was stolen from Bernie Sanders, the Democratic candidate who spoke out against oligarchy, growing income inequality, and even the Israeli lobby's dominance in American politics. 
But there's one other important element to this. Americans who identify as liberals, supporters of women's rights, and/or anti-racists have such a longstanding allegiance to the Democratic Party that supporting its nominee every four years is their knee-jerk reaction. Ever escalating foreign wars don't seem to penetrate their consciousness or conscience, especially when those wars are waged primarily with drones and proxy armies instead of U.S. troops. And once the Republicans nominated the openly racist and misogynistic Donald Trump, defeating Trump became a liberal crusade. 
There are, of course, glimmers of rationality and hope. Yesterday I was out canvassing for an Oakland, California ballot measure with a young Black man, a college sophomore. Despite Trump's overt racism, he told me that he considers Clinton even more dangerous because he understands that she has essentially promised confrontation with Russia over Syria. He understands that such escalation increases the chance of a nuclear war, accidental or not, and that Trump, for all his faults, says that the Cold War is over, that NATO is largely obsolete, and that Clinton is recklessly risking confrontation with Russia by promising to remove Bashar Al-Assad. 
Our Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein is reported to be polling at 16% among voters under 35, and much of Bernie Sanders's support was quite visibly from the same age group. Local, grassroots organizing is also empowering people to create institutions free of oligarchic and corporate control. They include community gardens, renewable energy buyers' co-operatives, and GMO-free zones. If a ballot initiative to make California's Sonoma County GMO-free passes, the whole northwest coast of California will be a GMO-free zone, from Santa Cruz to Humboldt Counties and including one inland county, Trinity. 
Don't you think that the two-party American system, with the candidates of two traditional parties, Democratic and Republican, is out of breath? 
I wouldn't say it's out of breath because it's still very much in control. However, Trump has left the Republican Party in disarray, with many Republican luminaries and funders defecting to Clinton, who is welcoming them with open arms. As Black Agenda Report Editor Glen Ford has written : 
(the Clintons) 'have succeeded in assembling under one party roof nearly the whole of the U.S. ruling class and their hordes of attendants and goons. The scam that undergirded the duopoly system that has served the Lords of Capital so well for so long, has come undone. Thanks to a white nationalist billionaire who was too spoiled to play by the corporate rules, the two parties of the ruling class have become one.' 
It's hard to say whether or not the Republican Party will survive this election or what it will be in another four years if it does. 
One possibility could significantly change this. If Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein wins 5% in this election, the Green Party will become an official national party eligible for 5% of the federal funds made available to official national parties to host their presidential nominating conventions and support their nominee. This year all federal funds went to the two official national parties, Republicans and Democrats, who also have access to huge amounts of plutocratic and corporate money. The Greens take no corporate money. 
Five percent of the vote and five percent of the federal funding for elections may not sound like much, but it would be a huge watershed for the U.S. Greens. It would be a big psychological and visibility boost, and it would mean starting the next presidential campaign year with more than twice the funds that Jill Stein's campaign has been able to raise. 
Winning 5% would also ensure ballot access for the Greens in most states, not only in federal elections but also in down ballot races. As it is, Greens are required to spend much of their time and money just gathering enough signatures to satisfy all the byzantine ballot access requirements that vary in each of the 50 states. 
Everyone knows that Clinton is the future president of the USA. In your opinion, who has facilitated her task and who has interest in seeing Clinton in the Oval Office? 
She is backed by the oligarchy, corporate and dynastic, particularly the investment bankers, the oil industry, and the weapons manufacturers who not only profit but also lobby for foreign wars. They are advancing their own interests by promoting a candidate who will serve them. Liberals have been conditioned to function as unpaid Clinton operatives in this election, and the corporate media, like the cops, serve as protectors of the oligarchy. And again, the majority of Americans are politically disengaged. 
You are close to Jill Stein, head of the Green party, who emerged late in the campaign. Why was this alternative sabotaged? 
Well, I wouldn't say I'm close to Jill personally, but she knows who I am and I, of course, know who she is. I've reported on her campaign and on the U.S. Greens for the past year, on radio and in print and online outlets, and I'm always honored when she shares those reports on her social media pages. I write for the Black Agenda Report and feel politically and intellectually close to its editors, who have given their full support to the Green Party this year, even as Bernie Sanders surged in the polls and many imagined he might actually win the Democratic nomination. In these times that are so easy to see as the end times, shared rationality and humanity are the closest bonds that many of us have, regardless of the geographic distance between us. 
Jill's campaign could hardly compete with the Republicans' and Democrats' because neither she nor any other Greens solicit or accept corporate money. We stand behind the slogan, 'People and Planet before Profits.' And we call for a halt to the death march led by the weapons manufacturers, fossil fuel giants, and agro-chemical companies who profit from it. Jill calls for immediately cutting the military budget by half, closing all the U.S. military bases in foreign countries and launching a 'peace offensive.' She proposes free public education from kindergarten through college, the abolition of student debt, national health insurance and a 'Green New Deal' that would reinvest the resources now squandered on weapons manufacture and all the illegal, immoral, lethal and environmentally catastrophic U.S. wars. The Green New Deal would create a renewable energy infrastructure and sustainable agriculture before it's too late to stop the climate meltdown ‚Äì if it isn't too late already. And it would fully employ Americans in meaningful, dignified and cooperative work for the common good. 
Of course that all makes far too much sense and threatens the highly concentrated wealth and power of the death-march industries. I would not be surprised if there were voter fraud to prevent Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka from winning the 5% that would make us an official national party. 
I have also seen enormous oligarchic determination to stop Greens at the local level. In 2003, Matt Gonzalez, the Green Party's mayoral candidate in San Francisco, seemed to have a good chance of winning. That so alarmed the Democratic Party that it sent all its best known, most powerful names and faces to San Francisco to campaign for the Democratic candidate. They sent Hillary and Bill. They sent Jesse Jackson. They sent many Democratic Party superstars more than once. They seemed to be more concerned about defeating Matt Gonzalez and the Greens in San Francisco than they were about defeating George Bush and the Republicans in the following year's presidential election. 
One of the founders of the San Francisco Green Party was elected to the City and County Board of Supervisors twice, but when he ran for Sheriff, an executive office, Democrats pulled him aside and said they could not allow his election unless he left the Greens and joined the Democratic Party, which he did. They still got rid of him after his first term, with a really ugly campaign, but that's another complicated story in itself. The City and County of San Francisco once had more elected Greens than any city or county in the country, but many of those that Greens worked so hard to elect have since defected to the Democratic Party for the sake of their political careers. 
Is Hillary Clinton a danger for humanity? 
Hell yes. I agree with Congolese author and political activist Patrick Mbeko, who said she's more dangerous than ISIS, for all the reasons I've already mentioned. Like her dark alliance with the death-march industries, and her seeming eagerness to confront Russia over Syria and/or on Russia's borders in the interest of global hegemony. Russian uranium deal aside, I think that Diana Johnstone was most likely right when she wrote that 'her strategic ambition in a nutshell is regime change in Russia '. 
And I have to mention my friends from the African Great Lakes Region ‚Äì particularly Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ‚Äì which became the killing grounds of the 1990s, as the U.S., using African proxies, established itself as the dominant power there. Most of my friends from that part of the world are horrified by the Clintons' all but certain return to the White House. The Clintons are deeply committed to the false history of the Rwandan war and massacres that was used to justify the First and Second Congo Wars and later the 'humanitarian' interventions in Libya, Syria, and Iraq. If the truth about Rwanda and DR Congo were known, Bill Clinton would be implicated in mass murder, but that's true of every U.S. president in office in my lifetime and probably long before that. No one's going to try to refer the most lethal military power in history to an international criminal court with more than symbolic authority. 

Libya lives total chaos. How do you analyze the situation in Libya and Clinton's role in it? 
It's horrible. Like so much else, it makes me deeply ashamed to be an American. If you read Hillary Clinton's e-mail, it's easy to see that the U.S.-NATO war on Libya was, for one, another Western war against another defiant resource nationalist, Muammar Gaddafi. Regardless of whatever human rights offenses Gaddafi or Saddam Hussein were guilty of, both were resource nationalists, as was Mohammed Mossadegh, the secular, democratically elected prime minister of Iran who nationalized Iranian oil before our CIA and the UK's M16 ousted him in the 1953 coup. I wrote about how this played out in Libya in ' Clinton E-Mail: We came, we saw, we got oil .' 
Obama says that failing to prepare for the aftermath of the Libyan War was the greatest mistake of his presidency, but I'd say his greatest mistake was waging the Libyan War in the first place. Like the Iraq War, it has created chaos and perpetual war that continues to spread through the Middle East and North Africa.

Theme: 9/11 &'War on Terrorism' , Crimes against Humanity , US NATO War Agenda Two years ago, 'Majd' wrote these words on a Facebook posting: ' I am Syrian‚Ä¶ living in Syria in the middle of everything. We have seen horrors. It was never a revolution nor a civil war. The terrorists are sent by your goverment. They are al Qaeda Jabhat al Nusra Wahhabi Salafists Talibans etc and the extremist jihadists sent by the West, the Saudis, Qatar and Turkey. Your Obama and whoever is behind him or above him are supporting al Qaeda and leading a proxy war on my country. We thought you are against al Qaeda and now you support them. The majority here loves Assad. He has never committed a crime against his own people‚Ä¶ The chemical attack was staged by the terrorists helped by the USA and the UK, etc. Everyone knows that here. American soldiers and people should not be supporting barbarian al Qaeda terrorists who are killing Christians, Muslims in my country and everyone. Every massacre is committed by them. We were all happy in Syria: we had free school and university education available for everyone, free healthcare, no GMO, no fluoride, no chemtrails, no Rothschild IMF- controlled bank, state owned central bank which gives 11% interest, we are self-sufficient and have no foreign debt to any country or bank. Life before the crisis was so beautiful here. Now it is hard and horrific in some regions. I do not understand how the good and brave American people can accept to bomb my country which has never harmed them and therefore help the barbarian al Qaeda. These animals slit throats and behead for pleasure‚Ä¶ they behead babies and rape young kids. They are satanic. Our military helped by the millions of civilian militias are winning the battle against al Qaeda. But now the USA wants to bomb the shit out of us so that al Qaeda can get the upper hand. Please help us American people. They are destroying the cradle of civilization. Stop your government. Impeach that bankster puppet you have as president‚Ä¶ support Ron Paul or Rand or anyone the like who are true American patriots. but be sure of one.thing..if they attack and I think they will‚Ä¶.it will be hell. Be sure that if it were to be a world war, many many will die. Syria can and will defend itself and will sink many US ships. Iran will go to war..Russia and China eventually if it escalates‚Ä¶ and all this for what ? For the elites who created al Qaeda through the US government and use it to conduct proxy wars and destabilize countries which do not go along with their new world order agenda !!? American people‚Ä¶you gotta regain control of your once admirable country. Now everyone hates you for.the.death you bring almost everywhere. Ask the Iraqis‚Ä¶the Afghans‚Ä¶the Pakistanis‚Ä¶the Palestinians‚Ä¶the Syrians‚Ä¶the Macedonians and Serbs‚Ä¶the Libyans‚Ä¶the Somalis‚Ä¶the Yemenis ‚Ä¶.all the ones you kill with drones everyday. Stop your wars, Enough wars. Use diplomacy..dialogue‚Ä¶help..not force.' Consistent testimonies from Syrians, as well as well-documented, open-source Western sources, and historical memory, all serve to reinforce the accuracy of the aforementioned testimony. Syrians are living the horror brought to them by the criminal West. They can not afford the complacency of shrugging their shoulders in indecision, not when their lives and their ancient civilization is being threatened by Western-paid terrorist mercenaries of the worst kind. 'Our' proxies, slit throats, chop heads, and take no prisoners as we waffle in indecision, ignore empirical evidence, and take the comfortable easy road of believing the labyrinth of lies promulgated by Western media messaging. The veil of comfortable confusion, nested in an unconscious belief that our government knows best or that it is patriotic to believe the lies and fabrications implicit in the hollow words of politicians (who no longer represent us) and the false pronouncements of Imperial messengers, is concealing an overseas holocaust . Western societies are rotting from the inside out because of these lies and this barbarity. We are protecting a criminal cabal of corporate globalists who do not serve our interests and never will. Our democracies, which we should be protecting, have long disappeared ‚Äì except in the hollow words of newspaper stenographers. Instead we are supporting transnational corporate elites and their delusional projects. Poverty and unemployment are all soaring beneath the fakery of government pronouncements, as the public domain evaporates beneath words like 'efficiency' or the 'economy' ‚Äî all false covers that serve to enrich elites and destroy us. Internal imperialism at home is a faded replica of the foreign imperialism abroad. As countries are destroyed, and its peoples are slaughtered ‚Äî think Syria, Libya, Ukraine, and others ‚Äî by abhorrent Western proxies ‚Äî public institutions are contaminated, and ultimately replaced by parasitical 'privatized' facsimiles. Public banking is looted and destroyed in favour of transnational banksterism, World Bank funding, and IMF usury. Food security is destroyed and replaced by biotech tentacles and engineered dependencies on cash crops and unhealthy food. Currencies are destroyed, sanctions are imposed, and the unknown, unseen hand of totalitarian control imposes itself, amidst the cloud of diversions and confusions, aided by comprador regimes, oligarch interests, and shrugging domestic populations. Syria refuses to submit. That is why the West is taught to hate her, and the rest of the world learns to love and respect her. Yet, Syria's struggles are our struggles. Syria represents international law, stability, and integrity: the same values that western peoples overtly cherish but stubbornly reject, as our countries wilt beneath suffocating veils of lies and delusions . I support Syria, because I respect what remains of international law. I support Syria because I reject Wahhabism, Sharia law, and terrorism. I support Syria because I reject the undemocratic, transnational oligarchies that are subverting our once flourishing, now dead, democracies. I reject the lies of our propagandizing media , the hollow words of our politicians, and the fake 'humanitarian' messaging that demonizes non-belligerent countries and their populations. In the name of justice, humanity, and the rule of law, I support the elected government of Syria led by its President, Bashar al-Assad. Syria, an ancient cradle of civilization, is leading the way towards a better future for all of us. All we have to do is open our eyes.

A dispatch from RT.com ABOVE: Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (L) and Julian Assange, Founder and Editor-in-Chief of WikiLeaks ¬© Reuters / Darthmouth Films Hillary Clinton sparked an FBI backlash, which is now surfacing, when she stonewalled the Feds, who were trying to investigate her private server, Julian Assange said during the John Pilger Special, courtesy of Dartmouth Films, which is now available in full on RT. 'If you go to history of the FBI, it has become effectively America's political police. And the FBI demonstrated with taking down the former head of the CIA [David Petraeus in 2012] over classified information given to his mistress that almost no one was untouchable. The FBI is always trying to demonstrate that. 'No one can resist us,'' Assange told the Australian journalist during the 25-minute interview. 'This is treason': Clinton's email server reportedly exposed to hackers of 5 spy agencies 'But Hillary Clinton very conspicuously resisted the FBI's investigation. So, there is anger within the FBI because it made the FBI look weak.' FBI director James B. Comey threw a spanner into the presidential race that threatened to become a Clinton procession last week, when he claimed that the agency had potentially obtained new information pertaining to Clinton's use of a personal email server, set up shortly after she became Secretary of State in 2009, when they obtained the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the ex-husband of close Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Weiner was being investigated for an unrelated sexting offense. Clinton has categorically denied mishandling classified information by using a vulnerable personal email address for State Department business. Fox News has alleged that the FBI has obtained new evidence from Weiner's computer that shows that Clinton was 'very likely hacked.' The right-wing network has also claimed that there is a 'high priority' FBI investigation into whether favors were exchanged by Clinton for donations to her husband's foundation, though other media have refuted these claims, saying that an earlier investigation into the Clinton Foundation, which cleared the power couple, remained closed. Assange: Clinton & ISIS funded by same money, Trump won't be allowed to win (JOHN PILGER EXCLUSIVE) Assange, whose WikiLeaks website has over the last ten months released three sizable batches of emails, relating to Clinton herself, the Democratic National Committee, and her campaign manager John Podesta, said the FBI has cause to investigate Clinton. 'There's a thread that runs through all of these emails. There is quite a lot of 'pay-to-play,' as they call it ‚Äì taking‚Ä¶ giving access in exchange for money for many individual states, individuals and corporations. Combined with the cover-up of Hillary Clinton's emails while she was Secretary of State this has led to an environment where the pressure on the FBI [to investigate] increases,' Assange said. Regardless of whether Clinton ever faces charges, Assange asserted that Clinton was beholden to corporate and political entities that have been hidden from the electorate during the race to the White House. 'She's this centralizing cog, so that you've got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like Goldman Sachs, and major elements of Wall Street, and intelligence, and people in the State Department, and the Saudis, and so on. She's is the, if you like, the centralizer that interconnects all these different cogs. She's smooth central representation of all that, and all that is more or less what is in power now in the United States,' stated Assange, who said that the leaked emails presented a clear picture of this nexus of influences. Assange also insisted that despite his image, projecting hope and change, President Barack Obama became 'very close to banking interests' during his own initial White House campaign in 2008. 'In fact, one of the most significant Podesta emails that we released was about how the Obama cabinet was formed ‚Äì and half the [first] Obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from Citibank. It is quite amazing,' Assange said. 'Libya was Hillary's war' According to Assange, Clinton's emails reveal a masterplan, hatched months before the West's intervention in Libya in March 2011, to make it the signature conflict of her tenure as secretary of state, and a podium from which to realize her presidential dreams. Assange: WikiLeaks did not receive Clinton emails from Russian govt (JOHN PILGER EXCLUSIVE) 'Libya more than anyone else's war was Hillary Clinton's war. Barack Obama initially opposed it. Who was the person who was championing it? Hillary Clinton. That's documented throughout her emails,' Assange said. 'There's more than 1,700 emails out of the 33,000 of Hillary Clinton's emails we published just about Libya. It's not about that Libya has cheap oil. She perceived the removal of Gaddafi and the overthrow of the Libyan state something that she would use to run in the general election for president. So late 2011, there's an internal document called the 'Libya Tick Tock' that is produced for Hillary Clinton, and it's all the‚Ä¶ it's a chronological description of how Hillary Clinton was the central figure in the destruction of the Libyan state.' But the scheme not only failed on a personal level, after Clinton was largely blamed for allowing a jihadist ransacking of a US compound in Benghazi in 2012, but also continues to haunt the country, which remains in a state of civil war, and Europe. 'As a result, there [have been] around 40,000 deaths within Libya. Jihadists moved in, ISIS moved in. That led to the European refugee and migrant crisis, because not only did you have people fleeing Libya, people then fleeing Syria, destabilization of other African countries as a result of arms flows,' said Assange. Over the course of the interview, Assange also expounded on his views on Donald Trump, the relationship between WikiLeaks and Russia, and his plan to leave the Ecuadorian embassy, where he has lived as a legal fugitive since 2012. The full transcript of the interview is available below. Assange: Clinton is a cog for Goldman Sachs & the Saudis (JOHN PILGER EXCLUSIVE VIDEO & TRANSCRIPT) Published time: 5 Nov, 2016 05:59 Edited time: 5 Nov, 2016 21:53 Australian journalist and documentary maker John Pilger (L) and Julian Assange, Founder and Editor-in-Chief of WikiLeaks ¬© Reuters / Dartmouth Films Whistleblower Julian Assange has given one of his most incendiary interviews ever in a John Pilger Special, courtesy of Dartmouth Films, in which he summarizes what can be gleaned from the tens of thousands of Clinton emails released by WikiLeaks this year. John Pilger, another Australian √©migr√©, conducted the 25-minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy, where Assange has been trapped since 2012 for fear of extradition to the US. Last month, Assange had his internet access cut off for alleged 'interference' in the American presidential election through the work of his website. 'Clinton made FBI look weak, now there is anger' John Pilger: What's the significance of the FBI's intervention in these last days of the U.S. election campaign, in the case against Hillary Clinton? Julian Assange : If you look at the history of the FBI, it has become effectively America's political police. The FBI demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the CIA [General David Petraeus] over classified information given to his mistress. Almost no-one is untouchable. The FBI is always trying to demonstrate that no-one can resist us. But Hillary Clinton very conspicuously resisted the FBI's investigation, so there's anger within the FBI because it made the FBI look weak. We've published about 33,000 of Clinton's emails when she was Secretary of State. They come from a batch of just over 60,000 emails, [of which] Clinton has kept about half ‚Äì 30,000 ‚Äî to herself, and we've published about half. BREAKING: #Assange : #Clinton resisted #FBI , and now they're out for payback (WATCH FULL JOHN PILGER EXCLUSIVE ON RT) Then there are the Podesta emails we've been publishing. [John] Podesta is Hillary Clinton's primary campaign manager, so there's a thread that runs through all these emails; there are quite a lot of pay-for-play, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations. [These emails are] combined with the cover up of the Hillary Clinton emails when she was Secretary of State, [which] has led to an environment where the pressure on the FBI increases. 'Russian government not the source of Clinton leaks' JP: The Clinton campaign has said that Russia is behind all of this, that Russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for WikiLeaks and its emails. JA: The Clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria: that Russia is responsible for everything. Hilary Clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that seventeen U.S. intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That is false; we can say that the Russian government is not the source. WikiLeaks has been publishing for ten years, and in those ten years, we have published ten million documents, several thousand individual publications, several thousand different sources, and we have never got it wrong. 'Saudi Arabia & Qatar funding ISIS and Clinton' JP: The emails that give evidence of access for money and how Hillary Clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically, are quite extraordinary. I'm thinking of when the Qatari representative was given five minutes with Bill Clinton for a million dollar cheque. JA: And twelve million dollars from Morocco ‚Ä¶ JP: Twelve million from Morocco yeah. JA: For Hillary Clinton to attend [a party]. JP: In terms of the foreign policy of the United States, that's where the emails are most revealing, where they show the direct connection between Hillary Clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of ISIL, in the Middle East. Can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of ISIL, are actually those who have helped create it. JA: There's an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton, not so long after she left the State Department, to her campaign manager John Podesta that states ISIL is funded by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Now this is the most significant email in the whole collection, and perhaps because Saudi and Qatari money is spread all over the Clinton Foundation. Even the U.S. government agrees that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIL, or ISIS. But the dodge has always been that, well it's just some rogue Princes, using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that no, it is the governments of Saudi and Qatar that have been funding ISIS. JP: The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the Saudis and the Qataris, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation while Hilary Clinton is Secretary of State and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly to Saudi Arabia. JA: Under Hillary Clinton, the world's largest ever arms deal was made with Saudi Arabia, [worth] more than $80 billion. In fact, during her tenure as Secretary of State, total arms exports from the United States in terms of the dollar value, doubled. JP: Of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called ISIl or ISIS is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation. JA: Yes. JP: That's extraordinary. 'Clinton has been eaten alive by her ambition' JA: I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick; they faint as a result of [the reaction] to their ambitions. She represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states. The question is how does Hilary Clinton fit in this broader network? She's a centralising cog. You've got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like Goldman Sachs and major elements of Wall Street, and Intelligence and people in the State Department and the Saudis. WikiLeaks emails shows Citigroup's major role in shaping Obama administration's cabinet She's the centraliser that inter-connects all these different cogs. She's the smooth central representation of all that, and 'all that' is more or less what is in power now in the United States. It's what we call the establishment or the DC consensus. One of the more significant Podesta emails that we released was about how the Obama cabinet was formed and how half the Obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from City Bank. This is quite amazing. JP: Didn't Citybank supply a list ‚Ä¶. ? JA: Yes. JP: ‚Ä¶ which turned out to be most of the Obama cabinet. JA : Yes. JP: So Wall Street decides the cabinet of the President of the United States? JA: If you were following the Obama campaign back then, closely, you could see it had become very close to banking interests. Assange 'sorry for Clinton as a personality' (John Pilger exclusive, courtesy of Dartmouth films) JA: So I think you can't properly understand Hillary Clinton's foreign policy without understanding Saudi Arabia. The connections with Saudi Arabia are so intimate. 'Libya is Hillary Clinton's war' JP: Why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of Libya? Can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us ‚Äì told you ‚Äì about what happened there? Because Libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in Syria: the ISIL, jihadism, and so on. And it was almost Hillary Clinton's invasion. What do the emails tell us about that? 'A very different kind of warfare': Clinton team on Benghazi committee leaks in #PodestaEmails JA: Libya, more than anyone else's war, was Hillary Clinton's war. Barak Obama initially opposed it. Who was the person championing it? Hillary Clinton. That's documented throughout her emails. She had put her favoured agent, Sidney Blumenthal, on to that; there's more than 1700 emails out of the thirty three thousand Hillary Clinton emails that we've published, just about Libya. It's not that Libya has cheap oil. She perceived the removal of Gaddafi and the overthrow of the Libyan state ‚Äî something that she would use in her run-up to the general election for President. So in late 2011 there is an internal document called the Libya Tick Tock that was produced for Hillary Clinton, and it's the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the Libyan state, which resulted in around 40,000 deaths within Libya; jihadists moved in, ISIS moved in, leading to the European refugee and migrant crisis. Not only did you have people fleeing Libya, people fleeing Syria, the destabilisation of other African countries as a result of arms flows, but the Libyan state itself err was no longer able to control the movement of people through it. Libya faces along to the Mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of Africa. So all problems, economic problems and civil war in Africa ‚Äî previously people fleeing those problems didn't end up in Europe because Libya policed the Mediterranean. That was said explicitly at the time, back in early 2011 by Gaddafi: 'What do these Europeans think they're doing, trying to bomb and destroy the Libyan State? There's going to be floods of migrants out of Africa and jihadists into Europe, and this is exactly what happened. 'Trump won't be permitted to win' JP: You get complaints from people saying, 'What is WikiLeaks doing? Are they trying to put Trump in the Whitehouse?' Assange, Comey & Clinton: The Assange Twilight Zone (E354) JA: My answer is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he's had every establishment off side; Trump doesn't have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence [agencies], arms companies‚Ä¶ big foreign money ‚Ä¶ are all united behind Hillary Clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves. JP: There is the accusation that WikiLeaks is in league with the Russians. Some people say, 'Well, why doesn't WikiLeaks investigate and publish emails on Russia?' JA: We have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. Our [Russia]documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up. JP: Do you yourself take a view of the U.S. election? Do you have a preference for Clinton or Trump? JA: [Let's talk about] Donald Trump. What does he represent in the American mind and in the European mind? He represents American white trash, [which Hillary Clinton called] 'deplorable and irredeemable'. It means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan, urbane perspective, these people are like the red necks, and you can never deal with them. Because he so clearly ‚Äî through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies ‚Äî represents people who are not the middle, not the upper middle educated class, there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them, a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting Trump in any way, including any criticism of Hillary Clinton. If you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power, that makes absolute sense. 'US attempting to squeeze WikiLeaks through my refugee status' JP: I'd like to talk about Ecuador, the small country that has given you refuge and [political asylum] in this embassy in London. Now Ecuador has cut off the internet from here where we're doing this interview, in the Embassy, for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the U.S. election campaign. Can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on Ecuador's support for you? Pro-Hillary US State Dept 'behind Assange internet cutoff' ‚Äì WikiLeaks activist to RT JA: Let's let go back four years. I made an asylum application to Ecuador in this embassy, because of the U.S. extradition case, and the result was that after a month, I was successful in my asylum application. The embassy since then has been surrounded by police: quite an expensive police operation which the British government admits to spending more than ¬£12.6 million. They admitted that over a year ago. Now there's undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds ‚Äî so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of London between Ecuador, a country of sixteen million people, and the United Kingdom, and the Americans who have been helping on the side. So that was a brave and principled thing for Ecuador to do. Now we have the U.S. election [campaign], the Ecuadorian election is in February next year, and you have the White House feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing. WikiLeaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of Ecuador, from this embassy or in the territory of Ecuador; we publish from France, we publish from, from Germany, we publish from The Netherlands and from a number of other countries, so that the attempted squeeze on WikiLeaks is through my refugee status; and this is, this is really intolerable. [It means] that [they] are trying to get at a publishing organisation; [they] try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the American people and others about an election. JP: Tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy. JA: I would be immediately arrested by the British police and I would then be extradited either immediately to the United States or to Sweden. In Sweden I am not charged, I have already been previously cleared [by the Senior Stockholm Prosecutor Eva Finne]. We were not certain exactly what would happen there, but then we know that the Swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me to the United States we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the U.S. has requested since at least 2000. So over the last fifteen years, every single person the U.S. has tried to extradite from Sweden has been extradited, and they refuse to provide a guarantee [that won't happen]. JP: People often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here. JA: Look, one of the best attributes of human beings is that they're adaptable; one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable. They adapt and start to tolerate abuses, they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses, they adapt to adversity and they continue on. So in my situation, frankly, I'm a bit institutionalised ‚Äî this [the embassy] is the world .. it's visually the world [for me]. JP: It's the world without sunlight, for one thing, isn't it? JA: It's the world without sunlight, but I haven't seen sunlight in so long, I don't remember it. JP: Yes. JA: So , yes, you adapt. The one real irritant is that my young children ‚Äî they also adapt. They adapt to being without their father. That's a hard, hard adaption which they didn't ask for. JP: Do you worry about them? JA: Yes, I worry about them; I worry about their mother. 'I am innocent and in arbitrary detention' JP: Some people would say, 'Well, why don't you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to Sweden?' JA: The U.N. [the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention] has looked into this whole situation. They spent eighteen months in formal, adversarial litigation. [So it's] me and the U.N. versus Sweden and the U.K. Who's right? The U.N. made a conclusion that I am being arbitrarily detained illegally, deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the United Kingdom and Sweden, and that [those countries] must obey. It is an illegal abuse. It is the United Nations formally asking, 'What's going on here? What is your legal explanation for this? [Assange] says that you should recognise his asylum.' [And here is] Sweden formally writing back to the United Nations to say, 'No, we're not going to [recognise the UN ruling], so leaving open their ability to extradite. I just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publically in the press, because it doesn't suit the Western establishment narrative ‚Äì that yes, the West has political prisoners, it's a reality, it's not just me, there's a bunch of other people as well. The West has political prisoners. Of course, no state accepts [that it should call] the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons, political prisoners. They don't call them political prisoners in China, they don't call them political prisoners in Azerbaijan and they don't call them political prisoners in the United States, U.K. or Sweden; it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of self-perception. JA: Here we have a case, the Swedish case, where I have never been charged with a crime, where I have already been cleared [by the Stockholm prosecutor] and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the United Nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the State of Ecuador also investigated and found that I should be given asylum. Those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric? JP: Yes, it's different. JA: The rhetoric is pretending, constantly pretending that I have been charged with a crime, and never mentioning that I have been already previously cleared, never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up. [The rhetoric] is trying to avoid [the truth that ] the U.N. formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that Ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, I am subject to persecution by the United States.

ARTICLE

BY PATRICK MARTIN 5 November 2016 A New York Times /CBS poll published Thursday documents the disgust of the American people with the 2016 election campaign and their alienation from the two major corporate-controlled parties. By a margin of 82 percent to 13 percent, better than six to one, those polled said the campaigns of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have filled them with revulsion. According to the Times account, 'With more than eight in ten voters saying the campaign has left them repulsed rather than excited, the rising toxicity threatens the ultimate victor. Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate, and Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, are seen as dishonest and viewed unfavorably by a majority of voters.' Both campaigns insult the intelligence of the American people. Trump appeals to raw anger, denouncing his opponent as a criminal who should be put in jail. Clinton and the Democrats alternate between portraying Trump as a sexual predator and smearing him as a tool of Moscow. Neither offers any serious program for improving the living standards and social conditions of the working class, the vast majority of the American people. The election campaign is one more sign of the profound dysfunction of the US political system, in which two corporate-controlled parties, each defending the interests of the super-rich, enjoy a political monopoly. The Times /CBS poll is a statistical verification of what the Socialist Equality Party and the World Socialist Web Site have long argued: the two-party system leaves working people disenfranchised. The recourse of both campaigns to personal smears and scandalmongering is a means of evading any discussion of the urgent issues that confront the electorate‚Äîabove all, the worsening social crisis and the mounting danger of a third world war. 
Notice the repeat pastings of the same photoshopped groups and individuals in this 'rally' for Hillary. This campaign will go down in history as the apex of dishonesty in US politics, and that's saying something. To cite two examples of developments ignored by both campaigns: Friday's newspapers reported that suicide has overtaken automobile accidents as a cause of death of children aged 10 to 14. One could hardly imagine a more devastating commentary on the dismal prospects that America in 2016 offers the new generation. The election campaign is one more sign of the profound dysfunction of the US political system, in which two corporate-controlled parties, each defending the interests of the super-rich, enjoy a political monopoly . Another report, published in the British Guardian , noted that life expectancy in McDowell County, West Virginia, once the heart of US coal mining, has declined to that of Ethiopia. In 2008, the nearly all-white county voted for Barack Obama. In 2016, 91.5 percent of Republican primary voters cast ballots for Trump‚Äîa vote of indignation and despair. Each of the candidates, in different ways, seeks to direct social tensions within the United States along reactionary lines. Clinton is the candidate of the status quo, representing the alliance of Wall Street, the military-intelligence apparatus and the complacent and self-satisfied upper middle class, where identity politics holds sway. Her program, were she to state it honestly, is to outwardly direct the social crisis in the form of intensified US military violence, first in the Middle East, but ultimately against Russia and China, both of which possess nuclear arsenals. Trump represents an attempt to direct social tensions along extreme nationalist lines, appealing to racist and fascistic forces. While he claims, falsely, to have opposed US military interventions in the Middle East, he glorifies the US military and promises to unleash unlimited violence on any country that resists US demands. In the end, his pledge to 'Make America Great Again' is little more than the English translation of Hitler's slogan, 'Deutschland √úber Alles.' That these are the alternatives presented to voters on November 8 is a product of the protracted decay of the US political system. It is more than four decades since the sharp shift to the right began in both parties, in the aftermath of the mass social protests of the 1960s and early 1970s against the Vietnam War and for the extension of civil rights. The Democratic Party abandoned its former commitment to economic improvements for working people and began to restructure itself as the party of Wall Street and identity politics, appealing to newly privileged layers of blacks, women, gays, etc. The Democratic Leadership Council, under its chairman, Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, became the vehicle of this transformation. In Hillary Clinton, this rightward movement has reached its culmination. The Democratic candidate has become the consensus choice of the political establishments in both parties. The Republican Party incorporated the former defenders of Jim Crow segregation and became the dominant party in the South, while maintaining its traditional ties to big business and the military. Ronald Reagan kicked off his 1980 presidential campaign with a rally in Philadelphia, Mississippi, where three civil rights workers had been murdered 16 years before, and gave a ringing defense of the Jim Crow South's slogan of 'states' rights.' Trump's embrace by the KKK and the white nationalist 'alt-right' is not an aberration, but the logical conclusion of a process that has paved the way for the emergence of an outright fascist party in America. As Leon Trotsky once wrote, the domination of reaction 'signifies this, that the social contradictions are mechanically suppressed' ('Intellectual Ex-Radicals and World Reaction,' 1939). The principal mechanism for the suppression of social contradictions in America has been the trade unions. From the late 1970s on, and especially after the smashing of the PATCO air traffic controllers strike in 1981, the AFL-CIO unions have worked systematically to undermine and break strikes, assist the employers in wage cutting and plant closures, and subordinate the working class politically to the ever more right-wing policies of the two capitalist parties. There is a definite limit to this process, however. Today, the unions are as sclerotic and discredited as the bureaucracy in the Soviet Union on the eve of its collapse in 1989-1991. The first signs of a resurgence of the class struggle in America, in a series of contract rejection votes and strikes, have already demonstrated that workers will have to fight not only the corporations and the government, but the unions as well. As the class struggle intensifies, workers will have to develop new forms of organization that make possible a struggle not just at the level of the workplace, but on the plane of national and international politics. The Times /CBS poll confirms the overriding feature of the 2016 campaign: the growing gulf between the American population and the corporate-controlled two-party system. Working people are moving to the left, but the two major parties continue to lurch to the right. In the current election cycle, the political radicalization in the working class was expressed most openly in the mass support for the Democratic primary campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Thirteen million people, including the vast majority of young people who took part in the primaries, voted for a candidate claiming to be a socialist and opponent of the billionaires, an unprecedented political development in America. In the end, Sanders capitulated, endorsed Clinton, and demonstrated that his claim to oppose corporate domination of the political system was a fraud. Working people must draw the necessary conclusions. It is impossible to fight the capitalist class through the two-party system that it controls. The working class must build its own political party to defend its own class interests. This requires a political break, not only with the Democratic Party, but with all those organizations and political tendencies that defend, apologize for and cover up for the Democratic Party. ‚ÄîPatrick Martin PLEASE COMMENT AND DEBATE DIRECTLY ON OUR FACEBOOK GROUP CLICK HERE ABOUT THE AUTHOR The author is an editorial writer with wsws.org, organ of theThe Socialist Equality Party (SEP) a Trotkyist formation.

ARTICLE

Dispatches from Eric Zuesse This piece is crossposted at strategic-culture.org The power above the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the U.S. Attorney General, and, above that person, the U.S. President. That's whom the FBI actually serves ‚Äî not the U.S. public. This is the reason why the FBI is having such internal tensions and dissensions over the investigation of Hillary Clinton: Not only is she the current President's ardently preferred and designated successor ‚Äî and overwhelmingly supported also by America's artistocracy and endorsed by the aristocracy's press ‚Äî but the top leadership of the FBI have terms-in-office that (unlike, for example, the term of the U.S. Attorney General) do not end with the installation of the next President; and these people will therefore be serving, quite possibly, the very same person whom they are now 'investigating'. This is the reason why James Comey, the FBI's Director, let Clinton totally off the hook on July 5th, when he declined to present the case to a grand jury: he and the rest of the FBI's top management violated three basic principles of trying white-collar-crime cases when a prosecutor is serious about wanting to prosecute and obtain a conviction against a person ‚Äî he (and they) wanted to keep their jobs, not be fighting their boss and their likely future boss. Hillary: For all intents and purposes, above the law. If America were an authentic democracy, there would be a way for the FBI to serve the public even when the U.S. President doesn't want it to. According to the only scientific study that has ever been done of the matter, the U.S. federal government is a dictatorship not a democracy. This was reluctantly reported by the researchers, whose own careers are dependent upon the aristocracy which they were finding actually controls that government. They found that the U.S., at the federal level, is not a democracy but an 'oligarchy,' by which the researchers were referring to an 'economic elite,' America's billionaires and centi-millionaires who control America's international corporations and the 'charities' (such as think tanks) that are dependent upon them ‚Äî including many that directly affect U.S. politics, such as the think tanks or other way-stations for former U.S. government employees to become hired by private firms. The authors of the only empirical scientific research-study that has been done of whether the United States is a democracy , or instead a dictatorship, excluded the very term 'aristocracy' (or 'collective dictatorship' such as an 'economic elite' is if that 'elite' actually is in control of the given nation's government) from their article. They did this so as for the meaning not to be clear to the U.S. public. In any country in the modern world where an aristocracy exists, aristocrats nowadays try to hide their power, not (like in former eras) display their power by crowns and other public symbols of 'the nobility'. The closest the study's authors came to using that term, 'aristocracy,' was their only sentence that employed the pejoritave term for an aristocracy, 'oligarchy.' That obscure lone sentence was: 'Jeffrey Winters has posited a comparative theory of 'Oligarchy,' in which the wealthiest citizens ‚Äî even in a 'civil oligarchy' like the United States ‚Äî dominate policy concerning crucial issues of wealth and income protection.11‚Ä≥ .. Their 11th footnote made clear that they were referring here to the book Oligarchy , by Jeffrey A. Winters, which stated the 'theory' that this article had actually just confirmed in the American case. Their article mentioned the book ‚Äî and the 'oligarchy' ‚Äî only in this one footnote, so that the authors of the article (whose own careers are dependent upon America's 'oligarchs') won't be able to be accused by oligarchs (or in any way thought by their own financial benefactors ‚Äî America's aristocrats) to have called the U.S. an 'oligarchy' (a collective dictatorship by the few super-rich and their agents). To apply either term ‚Äî 'aristocracy' or 'oligarchy' ‚Äî to one's own country, is now viewed as negative, an insult to the country's controlling elite. Neither scholars nor scholarly publishers wish to insult the people who ultimately are their top funders. .. This article was written in the standard unnecessarily obscurantist style of social 'scientists' who want to be comprehensible only to their peers and not to the general public. Doing it this way is safer for them, because it makes extremely unlikely that their own benefactors would retaliate, against them or else against the institutions that hire them, by withdrawing their continued financial and promotional support (such as by no longer having them invited onto CNN as an 'expert'). (This type of fear prevents theory in the social 'sciences' from being strictly based upon the given field's empirical findings: it's not authentically scientific. The physical sciences are far less corrupt, far more scientific. The biological sciences are in-between.) .. One particular reason why the authors never called the people who control the U.S. government an 'aristocracy,' is that everyone knows that the Founders of the U.S. were opposed to , and were engaged in overthrowing, the existing aristocracy, which happened to be British, and that they even banned forever in the U.S. the use of aristocratic titles, such as 'Lord' or 'Sir.' Consequently, within the U.S., the only term that the aristocrats consider acceptable to refer to aristocrats, is 'oligarchs,' which always refers only to aristocrats in foreign countries , and so is considered safe by the aristocrats' writers (including scholars and political pundits) to use. .. Everyone knows: in accord with the clear intention of America's Founders , the U.S. should eliminate from its citizenry any aristocrat (any self-enclosed and legally immune group that holds power over the government), but Americans naturally accept the existence of 'oligarchs' in other countries (and 'good-riddance to them there'), typically the ones in countries U.S. foreign policy opposes and often overthrows by means of coup or outright military invasion (any form of conquest, such as in 2003 Iraq, or 2011 Libya). It's fine to refer to other countries' aristocracies as 'oligarchies', because any such foreign aristocracy can therefore be declared to be bad and 'deserving' of overthrow. Thus, any aristocracy that is opposed to America's aristocracy (especially one that's opposed to being controlled by the U.S. aristocracy), and which wants to be controlling instead their own independent nation, can acceptably be overthrown by coup (such as Ukraine 2014 was) or invasion (such as Libya 2011 was). Thus, calling a foreign aristocracy an 'oligarchy' is supportive of, not oppposed to, the U.S. aristocracy ‚Äî and, so, 'oligarchy' is the term the authors used (on that one occasion, and they never used the prohibited term 'aristocracy'). .. Nonetheless, despite the cultural ban on describing the U.S. as an 'aristocracy,' the authors were ‚Äî as obscurely as they were able ‚Äî proving that the U.S. is an aristocracy, no authentic democracy at all. Or, again, as they said it in their least-obscurantist phrasing of it: .. 'Economic Elite Domination theories do rather well in our analysis, even though our findings probably understate the political influence of elites. Our measure of the preferences of wealthy or elite Americans ‚Äî though useful, and the best we could generate for a large set of policy cases ‚Äî is probably less consistent with the relevant preferences than are our measures of the views of ordinary citizens or the alignments of engaged interest groups. Yet we found substantial estimated effects even when using this imperfect measure. The real-world impact of elites upon public policy may be still greater.' .. 'Greater' than what? They didn't say. That's because what they were saying (as obscurely as possible) is that it's probably 'greater' than is shown in the data that was publicly available to them, and upon which data their clear finding is that the U.S. is an aristocracy, no democracy at all. Or, as they also put it: 'Economic Elite Domination theories do rather well in our analysis.' But, actually, 'Economic Elite Domination theories' (virtually all of which come down to positing an aristocracy that consists of the billionaires ‚Äî and centi-millionaires ‚Äî and their corporations, and their think tanks, and their lobbyists, etc.) did phenomenally well, in their findings, not just 'rather well' ‚Äî they simply can't safely say this. Saying it is samizdat, in the U.S. dictatorship. .. They were allowed to prove it, but not to say it. So, that's what they did. They didn't want to 'upset the applecart' from which they themselves are feeding. .. The simplest (but no less accurate) way of stating their finding is: the U.S., at least during the period the researchers probed, which was 1981-2002, was an aristocracy, no democracy at all. The U.S., in other words, was (even prior to the infamous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, which is making the aristocracy even more concentrated among even fewer people) a country of men (and women ‚Äî that's to say, of individuals ) not of laws; it's a dictatorship, in short; it is not a country 'of laws, not of men' . America's Founders have finally lost. The country has been taken over by an aristocracy. .. And one of those 'men' now, is actually Hillary Clinton, even though she is no longer officially holding governmental power. They know she soon might be. That's why, the FBI cannot really, and seriously , investigate her. .. It's not for legal reasons at all. It's because of whom she is. In fact, purely on the basis of U.S. laws, she clearly ought to be in prison . Any honest lawyer, inside or outside the FBI, has long known this, because the actual case against her is 'slam-dunk' , even though the FBI has refused to investigate it and has limited its 'investigation' only to peripheral 'national security' issues. (The #2 person at FBI, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, right below Director James Comey, specified this limitation to his 'investigators'. They simply weren't allowed to investigate her, except on the hardest-to-prove crimes that she probably but not definitely did also do. The slam-dunks were just off-limits to them. McCabe's wife's political campaign had received $675,000 from the PAC of Terry McAuliffe , a close friend of the Clintons, who chaired Hillary's 2008 Presidential campaign. And, even on the harder-to-prove matters, which FBI Director Comey declined on July 5th to pursue, they stood a strong chance of winning, if only Comey hadn't prevented their moving forward to try ‚Äî but those issues are tangential to the basic case against her, anyway.) .. There are at least six federal criminal laws which accurately and unquestionably describe even what Ms. Clinton has now publicly admitted having done by her privatized email system, and intent isn't even mentioned in most of them nor necessary in order for her to be convicted ‚Äî the actions themselves convict her, and the only relevance that intent might have, regarding any of these laws, would be in determining how long her prison sentence would be. .. I have already presented the texts of these six laws (and you can see the sentences for each one, right there), and any reader can easily recognize that each one of them describes, unambiguously without any doubt, what she now admits having done. Most of these crimes don't require any intent in order to convict (and the ones that do require intent are only 'knowingly ‚Ä¶ conceals,' or else 'with the intent to impair the object's ‚Ä¶ use in an official proceeding,' both of which 'intents' would be easy to prove on the basis of what has already been made public ‚Äî but others of these laws don't require even that); and none of them requires any classified information to have been involved, at all . It's just not an issue in these laws. Thus, conviction under them is far easier. If a prosecutor is really seeking to convict someone, he'll be aiming to get indictments on the easiest-to-prove charges, first. That also presents for the prosecutor the strongest position in the event of an eventual plea-bargain. As Alan Dershowitz said , commenting on one famous prosecution: 'They also wanted a slam-dunk case. They wanted the strongest possible case.' Comey simply didn't; he wanted the hardest -to-convict case. His presentation was a brazen hoax. That's all. .. That's the real scandal, and nobody (other than I) has been writing about it as what it is ‚Äî a hoax. But what it shows is that maybe the only way that Clinton will be able to avoid going to prison is by her going to the White House. Either she gets a term in the White House, or else she gets a (much longer) term in prison ‚Äî or else our government is so thoroughly corrupt that she remains free as a private citizen and still above the law, even though not serving as a federal official. .. Even if she is convicted only on these six slam-dunk statutes (and on none other, including not on the ones that Comey was referring to when he said on July 5th that, 'Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case'), she could be sentenced to a maximum of 73 years in prison (73 = 5 + 5 + 20 + 20 + 3 + 10 + 10). Adding on others she might also have committed (such as the ones that Comey was referring to, all of which pertain only to the handling of classified information), would mean that her term in prison might be lengthier still, but what's important in the email case isn't that; it's to convict her on, essentially, theft and/or destruction of U.S. government documents by means of transferring them into her private email and/or smashing hard drives. No one, not even a U.S. federal official, can legally do that, and those six laws are specifically against it. .. Motive is important in Ms. Clinton's email case, because motive tells us why she was trying to hide from historians and from the public her operations as the U.S. Secretary of State: was it because she didn't want them to know that she was selling to the Sauds and her other friends the U.S. State Department's policies in return for their million-dollar-plus donations to the Clinton Foundation , and maybe even selling to them (and/or their cronies) U.S. government contracts, or why? However, those are questions regarding other crimes that she might have been perpetrating while in public office, not the crimes of her privatized email operation itself; and those other crimes (whatever they might have been) would have been explored only after an indictment on the slam-dunks, and for further possible prosecutions, if President Obama's people were serious about investigating her. They weren't. Clearly, this is selective 'justice'. That's the type of 'justice' an aristocracy imposes. .. Why, then, did Comey finally switch to re-open the Clinton case? It wasn't merely the discovery of some of her previously unknown emails on the computer of Anthony Wiener, husband to Hillary's closest aide Huma Abedin. As Politico on October 28th reported , 'Another former Justice official said Comey's letter [announcing the re-opening of Hillary's case] could be part of an effort on his part to quiet internal FBI critics who viewed him as burying the Clinton probe for political reasons. 'He's come under a lot of criticism from his own people for how he's handled this. He's trying to gain back some of their respect,' former Justice Department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said. 'His ability to do what he does largely depends on the respect within his own ranks.'' .. Joachim Hagopian at Global Research headlined on October 30th, 'The Real Reasons Why FBI Director James Comey Reopened the Hillary Email Investigation' , and reported: .. 'Former federal attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova spelled it all out in a WMAL radio interview last Friday just hours after the news was released that Comey had sent a letter informing Congress that the case is being reopened. DiGenova said that with an open revolt brewing inside the FBI, Comey was forced to go public on Friday with reopening the investigation. ‚Ä¶ Finally, diGenova dropped one more bombshell in Friday's interview. An inside source has revealed to him that the laptops belonging to key Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, both wrongly granted immunity , were not destroyed after all as previously reported, but have been secretly kept intact by investigating FBI agents refusing to destroy incriminating evidence as part of the in-house whitewash.' In other words: Comey was between a rock (the resignation-letters piling up on his desk from subordinates who felt that no person should be above the law) and a hard place (his ability to stay on at the FBI and not have a scandal against himself bleed out to the public from down below). The U.S. wasn't yet that kind of dictatorship ‚Äî one which could withstand such a public disclosure. In order for it to become one, the aristocracy's control would have needed to be even stronger than it yet is. .. Also on the 30th, Ed Klein in Britain's Dail Mail bannered : .. EXCLUSIVE: Resignation letters piling up from disaffected FBI agents, his wife urging him to admit he was wrong: Why Director Comey jumped at the chance to reopen Hillary investigation. James Comey revived the investigation of Clinton's email server as he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents, sources say. The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim [Comey] announced last July that he wouldn't recommend an indictment against Hillary. He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents‚Ä¶ .. So, does this now mean that, finally, the FBI will bring before a grand jury the evidence that Hillary Clinton blatantly violated those six federal criminal laws against stealing and/or trying to destroy federal documents? .. There has never ‚Äî at least since 1981 ‚Äî been so severe a test of the extent to which this nation is (as those researchers found it to have unquestionably been between 1981 and 2002) an 'oligarchy.' However, a serious criminal prosecution of Ms. Clinton would potentially start an unwinding of this dictatorship. .. The present writer will make no prediction. However, obviously, the results of the election on November 8th will certainly have an enormous impact upon the outcome. Since I think that anyone but a complete fool can recognize this much, I'm confident enough to assert it ‚Äî a conditional about the future. About the author =SUBSCRIBE TODAY!

Dateline: Posted By On November 4, 2016 ABOVE: Cover of a 1947 Anti-Communist propaganda comic. (Wikimedia Commons / Catechetical Guild) The attacks on the planet, civil liberties and human rights are at the core of the American profit-driven, hierarchically-based governing system. While the ultra-rich keep prospering, large swaths of the population are disenfranchised. The tenures of Republican President Ronald Reagan and Democratic President Bill Clinton largely fortified and accelerated these assaults, exemplifying the bipartisan collusion of the elites against regular Americans. Much has been written about the unprecedented inequality in the United States. An additional marker of a society in crisis is the status of the mental health of its population [10] . With policies that have led to the privatization of prisons and health care, the deregulation of an already privatized pharmaceutical industry and a defunding of public mental health clinics, the nation is currently plagued by a mental health crisis that is reflected in a devastating heroin epidemic. But how can a system maintain legitimacy while riddled with such gross corruption and inequality? State means of control T he modern state relies on several techniques to control its populace. Data emanating from research in social psychology, linguistics and behavioral neuroscience has coalesced into a grasp of the workings of the human mind, and how it can be manipulated, i.e. the science of propaganda. This knowledge can be used by commercial corporations to encourage consumption of their products, and is often employed by the state as a means to present a convincing alternative truth, when the real truth is deemed inadequate. Whether it is to promote racism and scapegoating, war or the virtues of a particular politician, the techniques are the same: present biased or partial information to the public to promote a political cause and/or to divert attention from failings that have led to injustice and are likely to rouse dissent that would threaten the regime. In America as in many other parts of the world anticommunist propaganda is embedded in solid, media cultivated ignorance. The anticommunist brainwash afflicting a huge section of the American population produces displays like this‚Äîa complete inversion of truth. Here, the Right ‚Äîplaying on the hatreds and fears of the white underclass‚Äîproclaims Obama, a loyal servant of Wall Street and the reigning plutocracy, a sneaky communist. Only the dumbest and most confused of the population can believe that, and yet though mass propaganda, a substantive segment of the population believes such idiocies. But propaganda does not work on everybody. Some people see past the lies and distortions and are either complicit or discontent with the status quo. The latter are either victims of state repression that cannot be ignored or explained away, or intellectuals who study the mechanisms of state repression and propaganda. In order to quell these dissidents, the state enacts policies of surveillance, scapegoating, and criminalization that may lead to incarceration or even assassination. A useful way of assessing the legitimacy of a democratically-elected regime is to examine the extent to which it relies on propaganda to maintain control. It is clear that with growing injustice comes more dissent, which forces the state to either confront the roots of injustice or increase its propaganda to subdue the populace. The militarization of American police forces signifies an acknowledgement of the limitations of repression by propaganda and a shift by the state toward reliance on traditional violence for control. Red-baiting: Then and now One infamous American propaganda campaign was red-baiting, which reached its zenith during the term of Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s. Red-baiting served the American profit-driven capitalist state well, as any persons categorized as communists/socialists, i.e. advocates for worker rights, were silenced in one way or another. It is no coincidence that Hillary Clinton's campaign has been recently ramping up the use of anti-Russian rhetoric [11] , a close relative of red-baiting. This form of propaganda evokes visceral fear reactions in Americans, who share a collective memory of its disastrous effects on individuals and society during the cold war. Fear typically drives people to seek guidance and protection from a strong man/woman. Currently, it is meant to prepare Americans for the possibility of confrontation with Russia and to divert attention from the incriminating information that WikiLeaks is releasing about Hillary Clinton and her shady dealings. In just a few days, the highly stratified American society of 2016, in which lying is idealized [12] , truth-telling villainized [13] , and selfishness hailed as a virtue [14] will choose its next President, which will likely be one of two of the most unpopular candidates ever to run for President. It is evident that in any scenario, Americans can expect a bombardment of propaganda aimed at frightening and rupturing attempts at creating democratic collectives that may serve as alternatives to the corporate state. As the events at Standing Rock Sioux demonstrate well, when traditional propaganda fails, the state will resort to violent repression. SIDEBAR Anti-communist propaganda has always been crude, grotesquely dishonest and unceasing. Here's a sampler, from around the world as the ruling classes of Britain, Germany, France and other nations made sure their populations did not entertain notions of actual equality.

Poverty Rose in 96% of U.S. House Districts, During Obama's Presidency & U.S. Near Bottom in Public 'Confidence in Elections' Only Mexico Scores Lower Among OECD Countries Poverty Rose in 96% of U.S. House Districts, During Obama's Presidency O n November 3rd, Morning Consult's Jon Reid bannered, 'Poverty on the Rise in Nearly All House Districts' and he reported that, 'A Brookings Institution study , released less than a week before the election, shows that the number of people living in poverty has increased in 96 percent of congressional districts between 2000 and 2010-2014.' 
COVER IMAGE: The Great American Dream. A Vision common in the 1950s propaganda. That finding fits along with others, such as that the economic 'recovery' after Barack Obama came into the White House in 2009, went virtually entirely to the very rich. .. According to the top experts on wealth-inequality in the United States, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, American wealth-inequality soared faster during 2003-2013 than ever since the period 1923-1928, right before the Great Crash of 1929. Their study 'Wealth Inequality in the United States Since 1913' , published in the May 2016 Quarterly Journal of Economics , reported that ever since the remilitarization of the U.S. from the 2003 invasion of Iraq onward (and continuing under Obama, with boosts to NATO, and invasions such as of Libya in 2011), the percentage of total wealth owned by the richest .1% of American families (those families whose net worth was $111 million or higher) rose from 15% of the total in 2003, to 22% of the total in 2013, and this means that the percentage going to the lower 99.9% declined from 85% down to 78% during that time. .. America's soaring inequality during the George W. Bush Presidency continued unaffected by the 2009 change of Presidential Administrations. 
.. The dream is now a cruel joke for most Americans, all due to their political ignorance, a treacherous media, and the runaway criminality they have allowed in their political and corporate classes. In fact: whereas Bush's stock-market plunge in 2006-2008 hit the richest the hardest, Obama's coming into office restored their lost wealth rapidly, while the wealth of the bottom 90% of the U.S. population flatlined throughout his Presidency. The Obama economic recovery was no recovery at all for the bottom 90% of Americans. Not just wealth but personal income also soared for the super-rich under Obama. The 'Share of income earned by top 0.1% wealth holders' soared throughout Obama's Presidency, at least up through 2012, which is the latest figure shown there for that. So: at least the bottom 90% of U.S. families have experienced none of the Obama economic recovery; what 'recovery' from the 'recession' there is, went only to the very rich. .. Findings such as those are consistent with, and might help to explain, the finding in the new Brookings study, that 96% of House districts have experienced increased poverty under Obama. The nation's poor have gotten political rhetoric, but not much else, and the middle class also have received no net benefit, under Obama. U.S. Near Bottom in Public 'Confidence in Elections' Only Mexico Scores Lower Among OECD Countries Here are the figures, as emailed by Gallup on November 2nd, and soon to be published as part of the 'Gallup World Poll 2016': Confidence in Elections Among OECD Countries Finland 89%

[Graphic of Trump courtesy of Boing Boing ] Rowan Wolf, PhD Voice of Conscience A s the minutes tick down before election day 2016, I feel that I must throw in my final thoughts and feelings.
This is an historic election in so many ways. Let me point out a few: The first time that a woman was the Presidential candidate of the duopoly. The first time in the modern era when a direct member of the .01% without any knowledge or background in politics was the Presidential candidate of the duopoly. The first time that BOTH candidates were hated and mistrusted by the majority of the voting public ‚Äì regardless of party. 
Now that the 'firsts' are out of the way, let me deal with my real concerns about this election. 
We live in a time when the world is literally a political tinder box, and the United States seems bent on adding fuel and throwing Molotov cocktails all over the place. 
We live in a time when the Earth teeters on the brink of runaway climate and ecological catastrophe. We are literally at a point where most climate scientists are saying that we are near or PAST the point of no return with climate ‚Äì the point where we could avoid devastating, civilization destroying, extinction level event (ELE) catastrophe. Every single eco-system, and every ecological region on the planet is degraded and many are collapsing. 
This issue of the environment is deeply pertinent to the U.S. presidential election because one of the duopoly candidates rabidly does NOT 'believe' in global warming. In fact, this candidate wants to disband the entire Environmental Protection Agency and reverse all environmental protections ‚Äì from pollution to endangered species. (Frankly, this candidate wants to get rid of ALL regulations and treaties and apparently, most laws ‚Äì they get in the way of business). Can you guess which candidate this is? 
Video courtesy of the NY Times . 
I have watched as much of the left has joined the far right Tea Partiers and 'alt-right' white power movement in promoting Donald Trump as the better of the two candidates for President. The 'Left's' argument at base is that 'The Establishment' is against Trump so he must be better than Hillary Clinton (who obviously represents The Establishment). The fact is that the Left is standing with those who are ideologically (supposedly) 180 o from the Left I thought I knew. 
The Left I thought I knew was anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist, pro-social justice, pro-collectivity, and environmentally conscious. Yet most seem to have decided that standing with those who are white-centric, xenophobic, misogynistic, imperialistic, pro-corporate, anti-science, anti-intellectual, and anti-environmentalism, is the 'common ground' against The Establishment. I am sorry, but the logic eludes me. 
These same Left Trumpers argue that he is less militaristic and hawkish than Clinton, even thought Trump has said that he wants to dramatically increase the military (the only part of the government he seems to have a use for since they would be tied to his command). He wants to upgrade and USE the nuclear arsenal. His solution to ISIS (and other pesky folk in the Middle East) is to nuke them. He wants to re-take Iraq and get their oil. In fact, he thinks that we should just take over the resources wherever we want. He also wants to make Iran straighten up 'fast' (everything is going to happen 'fast') or presumably he will nuke them too. Then there is clearly a lot of money to be made in nukes and he wants to sell them to everyone. I have not found one thing that is less hawkish about Trump other than he seems to like Putin. Of course that could change on a dime if he gets pissed off at Putin. 
Trump is different than the ordinary candidate, and what he has done is step to the front of a movement. It is a movement that is now clearly fascist. Even many on the Left recognize that Trump is a fascist (there have been various comparisons to Mussolini), but there has been virtually no discussion of the movement that has not only been empowered by Trump, but is now legitimated as a political organization, part of the power structure and sitting at the table ‚Äì via Trump. And the racist Right (aka 'alt-right') is well aware of it. Trump says that there will be riots if he is not elected. The implied threat is of heavily armed militias in the streets and not peaceful protestors expressing their disgust and distrust. 
I have to wonder at how the Left has changed. We have arrived at a point where the Left (reluctantly of course) stands behind a fascist (and a fascist movement) for President of the most powerful nation on the planet. Please keep that in mind. No matter the degraded economic position of the United States, we have the largest arsenal and largest military on the planet by several magnitudes. Who is elected here matters more than ANY other country on the planet. 
So I am sad, and bereft. My country is sliding into chaos. My planet is rushing towards disaster. And the people I thought stood with me have lined up behind a narcissistic, vengeful, fascist for President. 
Oh we missed the opportunity of a lifetime. The Left could have gotten behind Sanders. No he was not perfect, but he was damn well a significant move LEFT. The Left could have looked at what was happening (given the popularity of Sanders and Trump, the two perceived anti-establishment candidates) and put forward a real viable candidate ‚Äì Jill Stein. With the massive dislike of both Clinton and Trump, we might have actually pulled off a real coup and gotten the Greens into the White House. That ship has sailed. 
I do not support Clinton. I do not think she is a good candidate. I do think she is sane ‚Äì though self-serving. I do know just how much of a hawk she is, and that she is more than happy to continue the agenda that both neo-cons and neo-libs have been pushing since 2000 (if not earlier). 
Regardless of who 'wins' this farce of an election, Trump and his version of Brown Shirts are going to be with us for a long time. I am left to wonder how the Left that risked their lives fighting Mussolini and Franco are now standing behind Trump. 
I have no illusions about the malignancy of Clinton, but I also have no illusions about the malignancy of Trump. The fact that Clinton is the Democratic candidate speaks to the fact that she puts her 'right' to be the first woman candidate, and the first woman U.S. president, above the fate of the country speaks volumes. It was clear that if Sanders was the candidate, Trump would not even be on the radar, much less in a dead heat for the presidency. It is now known that the DNC (with the help of MSM) sunk Sanders. Of course, much of the Left had nothing but trash talk for Sanders. It is also now known that Sanders put his political position as a senator above the needs of the country and got in line behind Clinton rather than refusing to support her and jumping over to the Green Party ticket (which speaks clearly as to where the hearts of Stein and Baraka are). 
In talking and corresponding with folks on the Left, I have heard that many are not even planning to vote. This includes the authors of a number of the anti-Clinton, pro-Trump pieces. This is stunning to me and a double blow as what they are doing is purely trying to influence the votes of others. In other words, propaganda. That some of my comrades would turn their pens and efforts to propaganda to influence the votes of others, and not devote that energy to promoting real candidates for real change leaves me tremendously disillusioned about the Left and what the goal actually is. I had thought that we were aiming for a world of justice and equality, of humane treatment of all ‚Äì including the planet itself, of true education and intellectual development, of support for creativity and the importance of it in a healthy society. Now I find that the apparent goal is to bring down society at any cost, and surely that cost will be high for little good arises from chaos. Rather, the most self oriented and violent responses are maximized when people feel they are fighting for survival. This is not what I have spent a life time fighting for and it is not what I will fight for now. 
My voting advice is as follows: 
Find out how the vote is running in your state. If Clinton is leading by a significant margin, vote for Stein and Baraka. If there is not that margin, then vote for Clinton. We have an electoral College- not a majority vote. That puts the electoral college members in each state as the voter for each state. 
Another option is vote swapping through a system like #NeverTrump . And yes, it is legal to do this. 
Vote for the down ballot. Vote for the most progressive candidate that has any chance of winning. Why? Because if Trump wins we will need them to help stop the slide into fascism. If Hillary Clinton wins, we need them to keep her from the the continued plans of regime change. 
One thing I know for sure ‚Äì we have a long struggle before us to get back to the point where we can embrace the diversity and richness of our culture, and to fully address the structured inequality that is robbing us of lives and potential every day. We were obviously NOT there before this election process, and we will be a damn sight further away from it afterwards. When hate becomes socially acceptable, we are all damaged, and lessened, and all life is cheapened. 
Is this the person you want for President of the United State? Would you trust him with your life?

[Hands Up installation by Basil Kincaid in Ferguson. heartacheandpaint.com] Henry A. Giroux Cultural Critic and Public Intellectual Editor's Note The institutions that drive and reinforce capitalism at its most direct and base level are not even considered by politicians ‚Äì Hillary Clinton included ‚Äì as needing dismantling in order to save children. Those institutions are (domestically) the so called 'criminal justice' and 'juvenile justice' systems, and (internationally) the military, mercenaries, and paid international forces that are hired to carry out US international policy where children are often collateral damage, and sometimes direct targets. The U.S. also uses poor children of all races, but disproportionately children of color, as front line expendable military troops. A s the distinction between the truth and lies fades in public life, politics appears to be increasingly emptied of any substance. As Lucy Marcus has observed , 'Nowadays, facts and truth are becoming [more] difficult to uphold in politics (and in business and even sports).' Certainly, in the age of Trump there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that the appeal to reason, informed judgment and facts is at odds with the current political culture. That is, truth and evidence have gone the way of the electric typewriter, or so it seems.
Americans seem to have a growing fondness for ignorance, an attitude that reinforces the downsizing of the civic function of language. Falsehoods and deceptions no longer appear marginal to political debate but now seem to shape much of what is said by the presidential candidates. This is shockingly true for Trump, who has organized much of his campaign around endless fabrications, sending fact checkers into a frenzy of activity. When Trump is caught in a falsehood, he simply ignores the facts and just keeps on lying. His followers could care less about whether he deceives them or not. 
On the other hand, Hillary Clinton has earned a reputation as a chameleon, willing to say almost anything to promote her political career, regardless of whether she sacrifices the truth in order to do so. Her email scandal is largely read as symptomatic of a more pronounced and deeper level of dishonesty. Consequently, she is viewed mostly by the general public as untrustworthy. In response, she has managed her truth deficit by invoking her lifelong defense of families and children. For instance, during the second debate she claimed she wanted 'America to be for our children' and attempted to bolster her concern for the welfare of children by pointing to her early work with the Children's Defense Fund. In the third presidential debate, she argued against Trump's call for exporting 11 million immigrants by stating that she was against his deportation policies because she 'didn't want to rip families apart [and was against] sending parents away from children.' In her political television ads, she points to supporting policies that 'will invest in schools and colleges [and will work to] develop an economy where every young American can find a job and start a family of their own.' 
Unfortunately, Clinton only focuses on managing some of the problems that young people face, rather than doing anything to change the conditions that produce them. For instance, she says nothing about what education should accomplish in a democracy when educational policies are driven by a neoliberal economy that she supports. And while she talks about providing jobs for young people, she has little to say about transforming rather than adjusting an economy marked by wide gaps in inequality, wealth and power. 
Matters of power, state violence, extreme poverty, institutional racism, a broken criminal justice system, the school to prison pipeline and the existence of the mass incarceration state, among other important matters, rarely if ever enter her discourse and yet these are major issues negatively affecting the lives of millions of children in the United States. And her alleged regard for children falls apart in light of her hawkish policies on global regime change, drone attacks and cyber-warfare, and her unqualified support for the warfare state. Her alleged support for children abroad does not capture the larger reality they face from when their countries are invaded, attacked by drones and subject to contemporary forms of indiscriminate violence. Rather than critique the US as a powerful engine of violence, Clinton expands its imperialist role around the globe. This is a key point in light of her defense of the rights of children, because her warmongering ideology puts children in the path of lethal violence. 
At the same time, Clinton's promise to address the problems many children face in the United States reeks of a disingenuousness made visible by her history of siding with and supporting policies that were injurious to children. Not only did she once disparagingly call young people super-predators, but as the First Lady she strongly backed her husband's campaign to 'end welfare as we know it.' President Clinton's welfare policies did great harm to poor children. They eliminated the Aid to Families with Dependent Children federal assistance program and infuriated Marian Wright Edelman, the president of the Children's Defense Fund, to the degree that she ended her working relationship with Hillary Clinton. According to Edelman , the bill represented a frontal assault on the well-being of poor children and families. Yet as late as 2008, Hillary was still touting this pernicious welfare bill as a success. She also supported Bill Clinton's 'tough on crime' policies, which, according to Michelle Alexander , 'resulted in the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history'‚Äî which has a devastating effect on the families and children of color. Finally, Clinton supported Bush's invasion of Iraq, which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children. 
Occupying the right wing of the Democratic Party, Clinton has aligned herself with a war culture that supports drone warfare and continues to support military policies that result in the needless deaths of millions of children in the Middle East, Yemen, Somalia, and other places that bear the brunt of America's foreign policy. It is difficult to imagine, given Clinton's coziness with the financial elite, big corporations, the military-industrial complex and the reigning war culture, that she will do anything that will lessen the violence to which children, both at home and around the globe, will face under her potential reign as President of the United States. Clinton has nothing to say about the need for a collective struggle for economic and political justice. Given her past history, Clinton's disingenuousness becomes even starker next to the images of war and violence that mark the bodies of youth both in the United States and abroad. Her commitments to war and security have been built on the misery, mutilation and deaths of young people and her recent alleged support for the welfare of children does little to cover up the many ways capitalism, militarism, state violence and racism are killing poor Black and Brown youth. Rethinking the Horrors of War 
The horrors of war became painfully visible when the image circulated of the lifeless body of Aylan (Alan) Kurdi, a three-year-old who washed up on a beach face-downin the coastal town of Bodrum, Turkey, on September 2, 2015, while traveling with other refugees toward the Greek island of Kos. A second haunting image appeared on August 17, 2016, showing five-year-old Omran Daqneesh, bloodied and covered with dust, sitting silently in an ambulance after an airstrike on Aleppo, a city in northern Syria. 
Ordinarily, such images of children dead, injured and suffering motivate public outrage and also incite people to act. Omran's image was widely circulated by mainstream news organizations and in the social media. The image provoked so much international outrage that the governments of Syria, China and Russia claimed it was pure propaganda and was staged. 
One of the most powerful images in history to provoke moral outrage and public anger was the image that circulated in 1955 of the grossly mutilated body of Emmett Till. That depiction of the effects of brutal racist violence helped to galvanize the civil rights movement. Nick Ut's 'Napalm Girl' via E-rea . 
Another image that changed the course of history was on display in 1972 when an anguished and terrified young girl was photographed running naked after a Napalm bomb burned and disfigured her body. The iconic picture played a significant role in mobilizing protests that helped stop the Vietnam War. 
Reactions to such horrible images still exist, but the brutal and unthinkable acts of violence they portray now seem to produce short-lived outrage and blend into the all-encompassing spectacle of violence and the fog of war. What is crucial to acknowledge is that the war has come home and has trapped many young people in its spiral of accelerated violence, which has become a new form of domestic terrorism and the primary force promoting a machinery of literal and social death for many youths. Domestic terrorism is now exemplified every day in media stories focusing on the killing of unarmed young people by the police and in the gun violence that is turning poor urban cities into war zones. Violence has become a habitual response by the state to every social problem. This has become more and more evident as the application of militarized police power produces on a daily basis a growing number of images of dead bodies which increasingly find their way onto the screen cultures of the social media. In the US, according to Marian Wright Edelman's Children's Defense Fund column , 'Seventy-eight children under 5 died by guns in 2015 ‚Äî 30 more than the 48 law enforcement officers killed by guns in the line of duty.' In other words, Edelman writes, 'guns killed more preschoolers in one year than they did law-enforcement officers.' In Chicago alone, in the first eight months of 2016, 12 people were shot daily. According to a Carnegie-Knight News21 investigation : 
For every U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan during 11 years of war, at least 13 children were shot and killed in America. More than 450 kids didn't make it to kindergarten. Another 2,700 or more were killed by a firearm before they could sit behind the wheel of a car. Every day, on average, seven children were shot dead. A News21 investigation of child and youth deaths in America between 2002 and 2012 found that at least 28,000 children and teens 19-years-old and younger were killed with guns. Teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 made up over two-thirds of all youth gun deaths in America. 
Gary Younge observes that every day in the United States 'seven kids and teens are shot dead' which adds up to 2,500 dead children a year. What is clear is that neither mainstream political party nor their respective political leaders, including Hillary Clinton, 'has a thoroughgoing plan for dealing with America's gun culture, [one] that goes well beyond background checks,' he adds. This level of violence has deep roots in systemic structures of racism, inequality and poverty that make visible a broken democracy. Rather than being viewed as a social investment, poor youth of color are now seen as excess, threatening, suspect and undeserving of either a society in which they are protected or a future in which they are treated with respect. Instead of educating them, America spends large sums of money to imprison them; instead of building schools, we invest more and more in prisons; instead of providing quality health care, jobs and housing for them, we consign them to dilapidated schools, push them into the underground economy, and criminalize their behaviors. There are few safe spaces left for poor youth of color ‚Äî rather our society offers them the promise of immiseration and a jail cell. This suggests not only a politics that has turned into a pathology, but also a dystopian logic that is as cruel as it is morally indifferent. 
Children and the Politics of Disappearance 
The killing of children in America and by US forces abroad has become part of a politics of willful disappearance in which a culture of cruelty, immediacy and forgetting works in tandem to eliminate any trace of the factors behind the production of violence in the service of the unthinkable ‚Äî a society willing to sacrifice its own children to the industries that trade and profit in the massive production and distribution of guns. Such extreme violence no longer appears to have a threshold that would make it intolerable. In part, this is because the business of violence has become standardized as part of the culture of business. Or, as Phil Wolfson puts it , 'the business of violence has become a far too accepted part of the fabric of contemporary life in the United States.' Tamir Rice remembrance / protest march. 
War culture becomes visible in the extreme violence captured in videos of the police killing of children, such as 12-year-old Tamir Rice and adults, such as Walter Scott, who was shot in the back as he was running away from his car by Michael Slager, a white North Charleston, South Carolina policeman. 
The scope and visibility of such actions often promote policies further wedded to military solutions, such as suspending civil liberties, accelerating the militarization of society and employing counter-terrorism tactics that rely heavily on military force. As violence becomes both normalized and spectacularized in the media, a war machine and culture becomes so deeply embedded in American society that, as Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri write in their book Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire , 'war has become ‚Ä¶ a form of rule aimed not only at controlling the population but producing and reproducing all aspects of social life.' 
Yet, war machines do more than produce extreme forms of violence; they also fix whole categories of people as disposable enemies and force them into conditions of extreme precarity, if not danger. This is especially true of undocumented immigrants, poor Black youth, Muslims and those young people who now inhabit a neoliberal social order that has substituted precariousness for social and economic protections. Young people today are told they are on their own and not to expect much from a society that offers them poor health care, a terrain of uncertainty and insecurity, a crushing burden of debt, no hope for the future, and a market-based value system that tells them that their security and survival is no longer a social responsibility but personal responsibility. If the future looks bleak for many young people, it is not because of their own doing. Yet, the ruling elite and mainstream media journalists continually label them as losers, suggesting that their failure is a character flaw rather than the outcome of wider structural and systemic forces over which they have no control. In this instance, intolerable violence is masked by a state that has been taken over by the financial elite and that has abandoned its social functions while emptying out politics for an entire generation of youth. Indifferent to their own criminal acts, financial elites unapologetically 'give precedence to private financial gain and market determinism over human lives and broad public values,' in the words of William Greider , and in doing so, inhabit the dark side of politics. Youth in a Suspect Society 
Young people, especially those considered the most suspect, provide a startling and eye-opening referent for analyzing not only how violence is represented and experienced, but also how it is distributed across a variety of interrelated sites. The daily violence experienced by youths, especially the most defenseless, does not often make news, because it exposes the harsh brutalizing reality that many youth face in a racist, homophobic, carceral and market-driven society. Such indifference is all the more tragic since one of the most unspoken acts of collective violence in the United States resides in its treatment of its children. 
What I call the war on youth is alarming given that the fate of a society's democracy is tied to the condition of its children. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the Protestant theologian, once argued that the ultimate test of morality, if not democracy, is how a society treats its children. If we take this principle seriously, the US has failed its children, particularly those who are already underserved. Many face a bleak future filled with low-paying jobs, the effects of the collapse of the welfare state, the threat of a lifetime of unemployment, the paralyzing burden of high levels of debt and a political landscape that prioritized exchange relations over relationships built on trust, dignity and compassion. All of these factors make the future look bleak for young people, but there are also other more brutalizing forces at work that now bear down on many young people ‚Äî forces that suggest that a distinctive type of hardness and culture of cruelty is now shaping American society and its view of young people. 
In this instance, young people marginalized by class, race and ethnicity are treated as disposable in a society in which the American dream has been turned into an American nightmare. Young people now inhabit a landscape of permanent uncertainty and crisis: one in which they are spied on, incarcerated, criminalized and written out of the discourse of democracy. No longer seen as a social investment, the most vulnerable youth have become a liability, subject to the harsh dictates of the neoliberal state and a symbolic reminder of a social order that offers youth no promise of an alternative and democratic future. The dictates of precarity and austerity have become repackaged and weaponized under neoliberalism and the ongoing morphology of violence normalized as the only possible mode of life. Under the reign of a war culture, America has arrived at a historical moment in which the war on children suggests that, as Stuart Hall, Doreen Massey and Michael Rustin have argued , 'the very notion of a future seems to have been cancelled.' But the war on youth does more: it also reveals the raw reality of power politics and its willingness to crush early on all forms of resistance among young people. The Challenge Ahead for Progressives 
The current presidential race and the debates it has provided make clear that the Republican Party wants to eliminate whatever social provisions and public goods are available for young people while the allegedly more progressive Democratic Party puts forward reforms that do little to address the underlying economic, social and ethical conditions that produce them. Trump goes further and wants to accelerate the war on young people through a law and order campaign that expands the punishing state. Clinton points to some of the problems youth face, but in doing so fails to address a number of important issues, such as the high incarceration rates of poor Black youth, the neoliberal logic of financialization, the rise of the warfare state, massive poverty, systemic racism, the surveillance state, segregation, the militarization of the police, the destruction of the planet and a culture of institutional and symbolic violence that surges through society like an electric current. 
If children matter, as Clinton has argued, then it is crucial to recognize that her concerns are highly disingenuous because she refuses to dismantle capitalism as it exists and fight for a social order that is no longer ruled by the commanding institutions that serve the financial elite and the dictates of global neoliberalism. If young people are to be viewed as a crucial measure of a substantive democracy, it is important to take seriously what it means to create a society that addresses their needs and opens up a better future than the one the established political and financial elites have created for them. This is not a matter of reform; it is a matter of radical economic and political justice. Such a challenge must address the current struggles faced by young people by going to the roots of the problem. This will not happen by adopting the language of reform, which has no way of addressing why the plight of young people has dissolved into a domestication of the unimaginable. 
The real challenge for progressives is to build a broad-based movement and create a set of alternate educational public spheres to take on the task of transforming (rather than reforming) the existing capitalist social order and its poisonous relations of power and injustice. Children matter because they remind us of the need not only to create a more democratic future, but also to take seriously the collective struggle and modes of resistance that can make it happen.

ARTICLE

Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN A s the moment of truth approaches, America's two leading broadsheets, the NYT and WaPo, continue relentlessly bashing Trump, shamelessly supporting a woman belonging in prison, not high office. A same day article discussed The Times' latest anti-Trump broadside. WaPo featured two editorials hammering him, following so many others earlier, disgracefully accusing him of everything imaginable, while practically elevating Hillary to sainthood by comparison. 'Will Republicans respect democracy,' WaPo editors asked? How can anyone knowledgeable about how America is run respect what's nonexistent, not earlier or now? 'The big question after Tuesday's election‚Ä¶will be whether the nation's leaders act to preserve our republic ‚Äì or hasten a descent toward a banana republic,' said WaPo editors. They failed to explain US governance resembles the way a crime family operates ‚Äì a godfather (or godmother) atop the hierarchy, serving privileged interests exclusively. .. The 'first priority (for the nation's leadership) must be preserving and restoring the country's democratic institutions‚Ä¶' WaPo editors claimed. How can it when none exist? America is a rogue state, run by its lunatic fringe, neocon extremists, waging endless wars of aggression, punishing ordinary people with neoliberal harshness, enforcing police state viciousness on resisters, a hair's breadth from instituting full-blown tyranny ‚Äì likely coming with Hillary in charge. .. WaPo editors are terrified about how multiple investigations of her wrongdoing might turn out ‚Äì heading toward possibly indicting and impeaching her, ludicrously claiming: .. 'There is no substantiated charge against Ms. Clinton that would warrant impeachment, or even talk of impeachment. Despite suggestions otherwise, there is also no imminent indictment against the Democratic nominee, or any available evidence suggesting that indictment is a realistic possibility‚Ä¶ Instead, what the nation has seen over the closing days of this campaign is a party preparing to (mis)use extraordinary congressional powers for despicable political ends.' 
Fact: Volumes of evidence show Hillary guilty of war crimes, orchestrating coups, other international and constitutional law violations, racketeering, perjury, obstruction of justice, fraud, influence-selling pay-for-play, and jeopardizing national security by using her private server for classified State Department documents ‚Äì enough to lock anyone up for life. 
Separately, WaPo editors said 'Trump's election would be a major threat to the economy' ‚Äì a way over-the-top unjustifiable claim, saying: .. His 'election would be a major new source of instability here and abroad‚Ä¶Suddenly, a man with a deep-seated hostility to, and incomprehension of, markets would be at the helm of the world's preeminent market economy.' A billionaire business tycoon with no comprehension of markets? No one could become super-rich without a keen understanding of how they work ‚Äì so what irks WaPo editors? .. They support jobs-killing trade deals like NAFTA and TPP. Trump's justifiable opposition riles them. They're angry because he's right accusing the (Wall-Street controlled) Fed of keeping interest rates near zero for political reasons, along with government agencies fudging economic data like GDP, monthly jobs numbers and inflation, among others ‚Äì to make economic conditions look rosier than reality. .. Trump 'failed to level with the public about the challenges before us, to provide a plausible sense of how he would improve things ‚Äì or to demonstrate much of anything except the risks of entrusting him with management of an $18 trillion economy,' WaPo editors claimed. Agree or disagree with him, he presented a clearer agenda than Hillary ‚Äì time and again proving she's a serial liar, dishonest, untrustworthy, ruthless and dangerous.

7. Emigre Super Bloc Part VII: Why Hillary Clinton Will Appoint Old World Nationalists to Cabinet Positions . Editor's Note If you learn nothing else from reading Eliason's 'Emigre' series, you should take away how interlinked world events truly are. When you add in the machinations of various intelligence agencies and national covert operations groups, tracing a thread through from point A to point B can become an epic journey. It is also a journey that leaves you wondering whose interests are being served? In answering that question, it becomes clear that the answer is much more likely a small, influential group than a nation state. Just look at the map of the countries involved in Syria's 'civil war,' and it becomes exceedingly clear that what is happening in Syria is anything but a civil war. It also casts a totally different light on Europe's rejection of Syrian refugees. How cruel and mean spirited can you get than to be involved in the war that has displaced most of a nation's population, and then close your borders to those displaced? 
W hether you are for Hillary Clinton or against her, the problem with Hillary Clinton isn't her lack of experience. Almost the entire political establishment is behind her. Throughout all the bumps and scandal in this whole election cycle, Republicans and former presidents are coming out of the woodwork supporting her. According to the LA Times she may well be one of the most experienced candidates in US history, even accounting for severe conflicts of interest inside the Clinton Foundation. Neither friend or foe doubt Hillary Clinton's experience after 30 years in politics. 
The problem is even Hillary Clinton's friends say she has, is a history of acting without thinking, of making bad decisions. According to Neera Tanden : 'Almost no one knows better than me that her instincts can be terrible.' 
Does Hillary Clinton show bad instincts and terrible decision-making skills, and if she does, how will this affect the USA? 
According to journalist Robert Parry 'the people that will be taking senior positions and especially in foreign policy believe 'This consensus is driven by a broad-based backlash against a president who has repeatedly stressed the dangers of overreach and the need for restraint, especially in the Middle East‚Ä¶ Taken together, the studies and reports call for more aggressive American action to constrain Iran, rein in the chaos in the Middle East and check Russia in Europe.'One of the lead organizations revving up these military adventures and also counting on a big boost in military spending under President Clinton-45 is the Atlantic Council, a think tank associated with NATO that has been pushing for a major confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia.' 
The Atlantic Council is the think tank for the CEEC which is associated with NATO. The CEEC (Central and Eastern European Coalition) has only one goal. At the beginning of the presidential campaign they put out a small list of questions for the candidates to decide who they would support for the president. 
The first question was essentially 'Are you willing to go to war with Russia?' Hillary Clinton has answered that question and received their unqualified support throughout the campaign. Who is the CEEC? 
The Central and Eastern European Coalition represent the various Central and Eastern European countries to the US government. What makes them special in an election is that they control a 20 million person strong bloc vote in key states across the country and sway elections by themselves. The price of a Clinton win is war with Russia. 
If that seems a little too much to be believable, reconsider the Iraq war. All it took was for the Iraqi diaspora to develop strong ties with like-minded people f rom ' The Project for the New American Century' that wanted regime change in Iraq. Many of the people associated with the PNAC crossed over into the Bush administration . They pushed the invasion together. 
Josh DeWind's and Renata Segura's paper Diaspora-Government Relations in Forging US-Foreign Policies utilized the following source to discuss the diaspora link to US-Iraqi relations: 
Walt Vanderbush's essay, 'The Iraqi Diaspora and the US Invasion of Iraq' (chapter 9), traces the collaboration between leaders of the Iraqi diaspora and neoconservative Americans, many of them linked to the Iraqi National Congress (INC) and the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), to convince the US government to wage war and bring about 'regime change' in Iraq‚Ä¶ The INC claimed credit for placing 108 articles in the news media, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Times (of London), during a nine-month period before the war.' 
It wasn't terror, Osama, or even oil that the Iraq war was fought for. It was a guy named Ahmed Chalabi who was the only victor of the Iraq war. 
American-emigre groups use their strategically settled populations in key battleground states, deep pockets, and unbridled political ambition to gain control over their home 'old' countries. Even more insidious is the influence they exert over the United States to destroy old enemies. 
Do we want senior cabinet and policy positions filled by people who think starting WWIII is a good goal? Let's take a look at the make-up and politics of some of these. 
Starting at the top let's look at the Ukrainian emigres who lead the CEEC and the Atlantic Council. One thing anyone represented by the UCCA (Ukrainian Congressional Committee of America) or the UWC (Ukrainian World Congress) has in common is Axis-political heritage and beliefs. The OUN is the political grouping of Ukrainian nationalists and it would vote for Adolf Hitler if he was running in a heartbeat. 
Unless real Nazi political views (not neo-nazi) found a way to survive all these years with this group of people, the statement is just insulting. Anyone reading should be insulted because that level of offensiveness in a politically charged environment is wrong. 
Nazism or Axis-Nazism are political beliefs and principles that structure a government the same as Republican or Democratic control would. The only difference is the 'ism.' The 'ism' means everything you do in your life revolves around your politic so it's not just political or social guides or guidelines. It's your lifestyle and everything wraps around it. Anything or anyone that goes against it is an enemy of the state, and it is personal. 
From their own words in the Ukrainian Weekly, real, active political Nazi's are alive, kickin' and ready for a Clinton win! It is the sheer number of groups self-identifying as practicing real Nazi beliefs in the US gaining policy and cabinet positions under a Clinton win that is incredible. 
The Ukrainian World Congress, with its affiliates in over 40 countries , and others work tirelessly in trying to keep Ukraine and the Ukrainian spirit front and center. 'We have had a minister of finance, Natalka Jaresko, in the Cabinet. We now have Ulana Suprun as acting minister of health. We have many from the diaspora assisting with strategizing, reforming and supporting the overall cause. We have a highly successful program in Patriot Defence. We are out to change the way business is done. Unity to act when required has been the diaspora's mantra ‚Äì this cannot be disputed. As time moves on, we see that things take a natural course. We see that two wings of the OUN ‚Äì (OUNb)Banderivtsi and (OUNm)Melnykivtsi ‚Äì are working actively on the international level, working in partnership and currently are in strong negotiations about becoming a single entity again.' 
With all you've heard about Stepan Bandera's OUN since the Maidan coup in Ukraine, I'll bet you didn't know they call New York, Chicago, Boston, and Philadelphia home. 
The UCCA and the UWC still celebrate their Nazi SS because they are still Axis-nazis. The OUN were the vile Holocaust murderers during and after WWII and their politics live on in their children today. This is no different from the children of other Waffen-SS leaders, or if Hitler had surviving children that stood up and ran other countries based in Hitler's policy. These American kids are sent to Ukraine to learn how to copy and act like Stepan Bandera before they come back to America and get involved in policy making. 
' OUNb leader Ivan Kobasa also took responsibility of making sure the Ukrainian-Americans received the proper secondary education at Ukrainian nationalist schools (MAUP) in Ukraine. From the mid-2000's enrollment in this educational system has skyrocketed. Today almost all members of the current Ukrainian government are graduates of this ideological system that was taught to them by 'moderates' like David Duke (former head of the Ku Klux Klan in the U.S.) who is also a graduate of the MAUP system.' 
While American media criticizes David Duke's support for Donald Trump, they say nothing about Hillary's strongest supporters hiring David Duke as a professor to teach their children college level history. Is Hillary Clinton too far right for David Duke? After all, he has no plans to conquer Russia. 
When you look at her campaign coffers and the most active political activists supporting Hillary Clinton, many are groups whose politics are not republican or democrat, but old-world nationalist. They are spread across America and still idolize their Waffen SS heroes, literally. They have statues and holidays and children's groups across America in cities like New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago celebrating some of the vilest mass murderers in history. And they teach their children to idolize them and grow up using them as role models. They also bring up their children in the same political mold of ultra-nationalism. 
Now they want an America that will do the same. Over the last 30 years, the old world nationalists have moved into media and policy positions to make this happen. If that wasn't enough they control a 20 million person bloc vote in key states and swing states in important cities across America. 
I am not using the word nazi as an insult, this isn't neo-nazi or even a nazi revival. These groups have been the most extreme political activists in the USA over the last 50 years and are a continuation of what their parents were in the 1930's. In their own words, they never assimilated into American culture. They assimilated the culture to them. In the words of the CIA, they are political animals. Today, their wagons are circled around a Hillary Clinton presidency. 
The OUN were the guards at the Holocaust prison camps, Waffen SS, and volunteer brigades that were famous for torture and murder. In Ukraine, they killed over 3 million people and conducted the first act of Holocaust at Babi Yar. 
The funny part, if there was one, is that with every fiber of your being, you want to argue against these facts. The OUN on the other hand featured at least one of my articles on their rise in American politics even though I called them devils. The fact they find me credible shouldn't get lost on you. 
When these good friends of Hillary Clinton from the CEEC start getting tapped for advisory posts, and cabinet positions through the Atlantic Council or Project for a New American Century, will they automatically become Democrats or Republicans? 
Does America want a war with Russia so the losers of WWII can settle old scores? 
For the first time, under a Clinton presidency, America will have unbridled Axis-nazis/old world nationalists/ nazis in most of the cabinet and policy positions. They are getting the positions because they are delivering donations, bloc votes, political propaganda, and hard activism in battleground states. 
The results for the Clinton campaign in emigre dominated states is the same as it was when they first got together. Clinton is up by 11 points in important emigre bloc voting districts. ‚Ä¶In last month's heavily publicized Pennsylvania Senate race. Ukrainian and Baltic groups, protesting the administration's attempts to prevent the break-up of the USSR, supported the Democratic candidate, Harris Wofford. This position contributed to the defeat of Dick Thornburgh, a former attorney general in the Bush administration‚Ä¶.'The Ukrainian Weekly, December 8, 1991, No. 49, Vol. LIX 
In a Ukraine Weekly interview with candidate Bill Clinton- ' For the last 40 years, many Ukrainians have been supporters of the Republican Party . However, Mr. Bush severely damaged his relations with Ukrainians with his 'Chicken Kiev' speech, and by his unwillingness to see Ukraine's point of view in disputes with Russia. How will your party seek to secure the goodwill of voters concerned by this issue?' ‚Ä¶ Clinton's answer‚Ä¶'The Bush administration has had a spotty record abroad‚Ä¶ including the president's insulting warning against 'suicidal nationalism' made before proindependence forces in Kiev in the summer of 1991 ‚Äî and a failed economic record at home. We hope Ukrainian Americans will join our effort to put people first.' ‚Äì Interview with Candidate Bill Clinton-Ukrainian Weekly Issue 43, 1992 
In what has become the ultimate pay to play scheme, the Clinton's gave over Ukraine to OUNb nationalists to run as they saw fit. This was payment for political support and bloc votes that won the 1992 elections for Bill Clinton. American citizens were given a country to run and represent in any manner they chose to do it. 
According to Ukrainian nationalist scholar Taras Kuzio , the Axis-nazi political beliefs started to be taught to children in Ukraine after the OUNb took the reins. This was the preparation for what would become a nationalist coup in 2014 Ukraine. 
This pattern follows the Clinton-NATO expansion and every CEE (Central and Eastern European) country freed by the Clintons followed suit. In Croatia, Croatian-Americans have more parliamentary seats and representation than any group from Croatia. 
Other than American-emigre groups gaining rule and representing the 'home country' in the US, there is only one other universal factor each of them revived. Axis- nazi politics and political views became normal in their home countries. In Croatia, they even revived the Waffen SS Battalions. 
The people at the CEEC are behind the Atlantic Council and PNAC will be making the domestic and foreign policy decisions in a Clinton administration. While I would not call Hillary Clinton a Nazi, the people she surrounds herself with actively are. There is very little doubt that Victoria Nuland, a Ukrainian-American brought up in these beliefs will be Secretary of State under a Clinton Administration. 
To get an understanding of what that means, the same people that are deciding Ukrainian domestic and foreign policy will be sending their people to those cabinet positions. 
The one thing for sure is even publications that support her candidacy wonder about Hillary Clinton's lack of judgment and surrounding herself with nationalist war-hawks that want war with Russia. 
According to the WEEK : 'At first, Obama went over the top of public opinion to avenge American honor against ISIS. Slowly, America's mission has crept to include some form of regime change with the ouster of Assad. Now Clinton is selling the American people on greater military interventions so that the U.S. can challenge Putin. Clinton seems unable to distinguish between what is of vital interest to the Russians and peripheral interest to America. She combines this with her bias toward always taking action ‚Äî of any sort, for good or ill. The combination is dangerous.' 
The article ends in the hope that Clinton is once again lying. Both current president Obama and Hillary Clinton are trying to sell America on the idea that there are moderates fighting a civil war in Syria. We are arming and training them. Are there moderates in Syria worth supporting? Do we have any business there to begin with? The article goes as far as stating the US is determined to overthrow every country that is friendly to Russia. 
Right now Clinton wants to establish a no-fly-zone to protect her moderates. Who are they? US Special Forces on the ground are adamant that Clinton wants to give US military support to ISIS even if it means starting an open war with Russia. 
' Nobody believes in it. You're like, ‚ÄòFuck this,'' a former Green Beret says of America's covert and clandestine programs to train and arm Syrian militias. 'Everyone on the ground knows they are jihadis. No one on the ground believes in this mission or this effort, and they know they are just training the next generation of jihadis, so they are sabotaging it by saying, ‚ÄòFuck it, who cares?'' 'I don't want to be responsible for Nusra guys saying they were trained by Americans,' the Green Beret added. 
Since 2014, Ukraine has fully supported al Nusra and at the beginning of the civil war pulled 200 ISIS fighters to the Ukrainian front lines. These fighters are jihadis from Crimea. They have also set up an ISIS training camp near Mariupol. Like all other volunteers, they don't receive government support and rob to make a living. 
Before this, the Kosovo example looms large. Does inviting indicted mass murderers and people preparing for illegal organ trade (crimes against humanity) trials to your national party convention as special guests qualify as good judgment? Does it showcase Hillary Clinton's good instincts to be president? 
Welcome to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Hillary Clinton's special guest from Kosovo took time-out from preparing for his crimes against humanity case to give support and wish her well. 'Invited as a guest to the 2016 Democratic National Convention is none other than Kadri Veseli, the Speaker of the Kosovo Assembly. Veseli is a former Kosovar Albanian leader of the KLA and its spy organization SHIK. He's being indicted along with the current president of Kosovo, Hashim Thaci for small things like organ trafficking and crimes against humanity .' The main witness against Clinton friends, Veseli and Thaci, is a man that was ordered to cut the heart out of another man that was begging for mercy. In a 1998 interview with the BBC , US special envoy to the Balkans, Robert Gelbard had this to say about Veseli and Thaci; 'I know a terrorist when I see one and these men are terrorists.' 
Clinton's relationship with the Albanian and Kosovo killers stretches back to the Bill Clinton's first election in 1992. During the campaign season the Clinton duo found out quickly how powerful the emigre national vote was in America. In one fell swoop, the Albanians and the KLA after them went from what the USA definitely recognized as Islamic terrorists to victims we were going to war for. 
The Clinton humanitarian bombing in the Balkans drove victims into the waiting clutches of the KLA, and the spread of Islamic terrorism worldwide. 
In what became her first executive decision, first lady, Hillary Clinton brow-beat the unwilling president Clinton into bombing the Balkans and creating a humanitarian catastrophe. Today, as a result of this, ISIS is setting up training camps in what is widely referred to as 'Clinton country. ' 
' On the territory of Kosovo and Metohija , the local police detained three militants of so-called 'Islamic State' (a terrorist organization banned in Russia), is going to organize a series of terrorist attacks in Serbia.'

The Anti-Empire Report #146 By William Blum ‚Äì Published November 6th, 2016 L ouis XVI needed a revolution, Napoleon needed two historic military defeats, the Spanish Empire in the New World needed multiple revolutions, the Russian Czar needed a communist revolution, the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires needed World War I, Nazi Germany needed World War II, Imperial Japan needed two atomic bombs, the Portuguese Empire in Africa needed a military coup at home, the Soviet Empire needed Mikhail Gorbachev ‚Ä¶ What will the American Empire need? ABOVE: Nuremberg tribunal. A new one is in order to try most of the political leaders, CEOs, media barons and their prostitutes, and similar agents of domination, exploitation, endless war, and imperialism for the past 100 years. 'I don't believe anyone will consciously launch World War III. The situation now is more like the eve of World War I, when great powers were armed and ready to go when an incident set things off. Ever since Gorbachev naively ended the Cold War, the hugely over-armed United States has been actively surrounding Russia with weapons systems, aggressive military exercises, NATO expansion. At the same time, in recent years the demonization of Vladimir Putin has reached war propaganda levels. Russians have every reason to believe that the United States is preparing for war against them, and are certain to take defensive measures. This mixture of excessive military preparations and propaganda against an 'evil enemy' make it very easy for some trivial incident to blow it all up.' ‚Äì Diana Johnstone, author of 'Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton' ALL IN THE FAMILY Just pals, all of them, just pals. It's all been such a joyful ride. Obviously neither Clinton, nor Obama, or Carter, find anything amiss in celebrating George W Bush, one of the worst criminals in modern history. (George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, April 25, 2013. Official White House Photo by Pete Souza) In September 2013 President Obama stood before the United Nations General Assembly and declared, 'I believe America is exceptional.' The following year at the UN, the president classified Russia as one of the three threats to the world along with the Islamic State and the ebola virus. On March 9, 2015 President Barack Obama declared Venezuela 'an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States'. Vladimir Putin, speaking at the UN in 2015, addressing the United States re its foreign policy: 'Do you realize what you have done?' Since the end of World War 2, the United States has: Attempted to overthrow more than 50 foreign governments, most of which were democratically-elected. Dropped bombs on the people of more than 30 countries. Attempted to assassinate more than 50 foreign leaders. Attempted to suppress a populist or nationalist movement in 20 countries. Grossly interfered in democratic elections in at least 30 countries.* Plus ‚Ä¶ although not easily quantified ‚Ä¶ has been more involved in the practice of torture than any other country in the world ‚Ä¶ for over a century ‚Ä¶ not just performing the actual torture, but teaching it, providing the manuals, and furnishing the equipment. *See chapter 18 of William Blum, 'Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower' On October 28, 2016 Russia was voted off the UN Human Rights Council. At the same time Saudi Arabia won a second term, uncontested. Does anyone know George Orwell's email address? A million refugees from Washington's warfare are currently over-running Europe. They're running from Afghanistan and Iraq; from Libya and Somalia; from Syria and Pakistan. Germany is taking in many Syrian refugees because of its World War Two guilt. What will the United States do in the future because of its guilt? But Americans are not raised to feel such guilt. ' The Plan is for the United States to rule the world. The overt theme is unilateralism, but it is ultimately a story of domination. It calls for the United States to maintain its overwhelming superiority and prevent new rivals from rising up to challenge it on the world stage. It calls for dominion over friends and enemies alike. It says not that the United States must be more powerful, or most powerful, but that it must be absolutely powerful.' Vice-President Dick Cheney ‚Äì West Point lecture, June 2002 Two flew over the cuckoo's nest: 'We are, as a matter of empirical fact and undeniable history, the greatest force for good the world has ever known. ‚Ä¶ security and freedom for millions of people around the globe have depended on America's military , economic, political, and diplomatic might.' ‚Äì Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney, 'Why the world needs a powerful America' (2015) State Department spokesperson Mark Toner: 'Assad must go even if Syria goes with him.' Many of the moves the Obama administration has made in terms of its Cuba policy are in lockstep with Bill Clinton's, as expressed in the recommendations of a 1999 task force report from the Council on Foreign Relations. The report asserted that 'no change in policy should have the primary effect of consolidating, or appearing to legitimize, the political status quo on the island.' A successful American regime change operation in Syria would cut across definite interests of the Russian state. These include the likely use of Syria as a new pipeline route to bring gas from Qatar to the European market, thereby undercutting Gazprom, Russia's largest corporation and biggest exporter. Assad's refusal to consider such a route played no small role in Qatar's pouring billions of dollars in arms and funds into the Syrian civil war on behalf of anti-Assad forces. 'War with Russia will be nuclear. Washington has prepared for it. Washington has abandoned the ABM treaty, created what it thinks is an ABM shield, and changed its war doctrine to permit US nuclear first strike. All of this is obviously directed at Russia, and the Russian government knows it. How long will Russia sit there waiting for Washington's first strike?' ‚Äì Paul Craig Roberts, 2014 Iran signed the nuclear accords with the United States earlier this year by agreeing to stop what it never was doing. Any Iranian nuclear ambition, real or imagined, is of course a result of American hostility towards Iran, and not the other way around. If the European Union were an independent and rational government it would absolutely forbid any member country from stockpiling American nuclear weapons or hosting a US anti-ballistic missile site or any other military base anywhere close to Russia's borders. Full Spectrum Dominance , a term the Pentagon loves to use to refer to total control of the planet: land, sea, air, space, outer space and cyberspace. Can you imagine any other country speaking this way? Henry Kissinger at the Paris Peace Talks, September 1970. 'I refuse to believe that a little fourth rate power like North Vietnam does not have a breaking point.' In 2010, WikiLeaks released a cable sent to US embassies by then- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She wrote this: 'Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support for Al Qaeda, the Taliban, al Nusra and other terrorist groups ‚Ä¶ worldwide.' Surely this resulted in at least Washington's much-favored weapon: sanctions of various kinds. It did not. US General Barry McCaffrey , April 2015: 'Because so far NATO's reaction to Putin's aggression (sic) has been to send a handful of forces to the Baltics to demonstrate 'resolve,' which has only convinced Putin that the alliance is either unable or unwilling to fight. So we had better change his calculus pretty soon, and contest Putin's stated doctrine that he is willing to intervene militarily in other countries to 'protect' Russia-speaking people. For God's sake, the last time we heard that was just before Hitler invaded the Sudetenland.' No, my dear general, we heard that repeatedly in 1978 when the United States invaded the tiny nation of Grenada to protect and rescue hundreds of Americans who supposedly were in danger from the new leftist government. It was all a fraud, no more than an excuse to overthrow a government that didn't believe that the American Empire was God's gift to humanity. Since 1980, the United States has intervened in the affairs of fourteen Muslim countries, at worst invading or bombing them. They are (in chronological order) Iran, Libya, Lebanon, Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Kosovo, Yemen, Pakistan, and now Syria. How our never-ending mideast horror began: Radio Address of George W. Bush, September 28, 2002: 'The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons, is rebuilding the facilities to make more and, according to the British government, could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes after the order is given. The regime has long-standing and continuing ties to terrorist groups, and there are al Qaeda terrorists inside Iraq. This regime is seeking a nuclear bomb, and with fissile material could build one within a year.' Yet ‚Ä¶ just six weeks before 9/11, Condoleezza Rice told CNN: 'Let's remember that his [Saddam's] country is divided, in effect. He does not control the northern part of his country. We are able to keep his arms from him. His military forces have not been rebuilt.' The fact is that there is more participation by the Cuban population in the running of their country than there is by the American population in the running of theirs. One important reason is the absence of the numerous private corporations which, in the United States, exert great influence over all aspects of life. 'The U.S. is frantically surrounding China with military weapons, advanced aircraft, naval fleets and a multitude of military bases from Japan, South Korea and the Philippines through several nearby smaller Pacific islands to its new and enlarged base in Australia ‚Ä¶ The U.S. naval fleet, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines patrol China's nearby waters. Warplanes, surveillance planes, drones and spying satellites cover the skies, creating a symbolic darkness at noon.' (Jack A. Smith, 'Hegemony Games: USA vs. PRC', CounterPunch) Crimea had never voluntarily left Russia. The USSR's leader Nikita Khrushchev, a native of the region, had donated Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. Crimeans were always strongly opposed to that change and voted overwhelmingly to rejoin Russia after the US-induced Ukrainian coup in 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin refers to the Ukrainian army as 'NATO's foreign legion', which does not pursue Ukraine's national interests. The United States, however, insists on labeling the Russian action in Crimea as an invasion. Putin re Crimea/Ukraine: 'Our western partners (sic) created the 'Kosovo precedent' with their own hands. In a situation absolutely the same as the one in Crimea they recognized Kosovo's secession from Serbia legitimate while arguing that no permission from a country's central authority for a unilateral declaration of independence is necessary‚Ä¶ And the UN International Court of Justice agreed with those arguments. That's what they said; that's what they trumpeted all over the world and coerced everyone to accept ‚Äì and now they are complaining about Crimea. Why is that?' Paul Craig Roberts: 'The absurdity of it all! Even a moron knows that if Russia is going to put tanks and troops into Ukraine, Russia will put in enough to do the job. The war would be over in a few days if not in a few hours. As Putin himself said some months ago, if the Russian military enters Ukraine, the news will not be the fate of Donetsk or Mauriupol, but the fall of Kiev and Lviv.' In a major examination of US policy vis-√†-vis China, published in March 2015, the authoritative Council on Foreign Relations bluntly declared that 'there is no real prospect of building fundamental trust, 'peaceful coexistence,' 'mutual understanding,' a strategic partnership, or a 'new type of major country relations' between the United States and China.' The United States, the report declares, must, therefore, develop 'the political will' and military capabilities 'to deal with China to protect vital U.S. interests.' 'John F. Kennedy changed the mission of the Latin American military from 'hemispheric defense' ‚Äì an outdated relic of World War II ‚Äì to 'internal security,' which means war against the domestic population.' ‚Äì Noam Chomsky Cuban baseball players who are paid a million dollars to play for an American team are not 'defectors', a word which has a clear political connotation. Boris Yeltsin was acceptable to American and Europeans because he was seen as a weak, pliable figure that allowed Western capital free rein in the newly opened Russian territory following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin's era was also a time of rampant corruption by Russian oligarchs who were closely associated with Western capital. That corrosive culture came to a halt with the election of Vladimir Putin twice as president between 2000-2008, and again in 2012. Many ISIS leaders were former Iraqi military officers who were imprisoned by American troops. The fight isn't against ISIS, it's against Assad; at the next level it isn't against Assad, it's against Putin; then, at the next level, it isn't against Putin, it's against the country most likely to stand in the way of US world domination, Russia. And it's forever. Connecting to the US-based Internet would mean channeling all of Cuba's communications directly to the NSA. George W. Bush has been living a comparatively quiet life in Texas, with a focus on his paintings. 'I'm trying to leave something behind', he said a couple of years ago. Yeah, right, George. We can stand up some of the paintings against the large piles of Iraqi dead bodies. Seymour Hirsch: 'America would be much better off, if, 30 years ago, we had let Russia continue its war in Afghanistan ‚Ä¶ The mistake was made by the Carter administration which was trying to stop the Russians from their invasion (sic) of Afghanistan. We'd be better off had we let the Russians beat the Taliban.' ( Deutsche Welle , April 2, 2014 interview) We'd be even better off if we hadn't overthrown the progressive, secular Afghan government, giving rise to the Taliban in the first place and inciting the Russians to intervene on their border lest the Soviet Islamic population was stirred up. The former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in an interview in 1998 summed up exactly what the US thinks of the UN: 'The UN plays a very important role. But if we don't like it, we always have the option of following our own national security interests, which I assure you we will do if we don't like what's going on.' She is now a foreign-policy advisor to Hillary Clinton. 'A leader taking his (or her) nation to war is as dysfunctional in the family of humankind as an abusive parent is in an individual family.' ‚Äì Suey Kane 'It would be some time before I fully realized that the United States sees little need for diplomacy. Power is enough. Only the weak rely on diplomacy ‚Ä¶ The Roman Empire had no need for diplomacy. Nor does the United States.' ‚Äì Boutros Boutros-Ghali , Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1992 to December 1996 'Interventions are not against dictators but against those who try to distribute: not against Jim√©nez in Venezuela but Ch√°vez, not against Somoza in Nicaragua but the Sandinistas, not against Batista in Cuba but Castro, not against Pinochet in Chile but Allende, not against Guatemala dictators but Arbenz, not against the shah in Iran but Mossadegh, etc.' ‚Äì Johan Galtung, Norwegian, principal founder of the discipline of peace and conflict studies 'No mention was made that Iraq's Christians had been safe and sound under President Saddam Hussein ‚Äì even privileged ‚Äì until President George Bush invaded and destroyed Iraq. We can expect the same fate for Syria's Christians if the protection of the Assad regime is torn away by the US-engineered uprising. We will then shed crocodile tears for Syria's Christians.' ‚Äì Eric Margolis, 2014 'Jewish Power is the capacity to silence the debate on Jewish Power.' ‚Äì Gilad Atzmon 'We need a trial to judge all those who bear significant responsibility for the past century ‚Äì the most murderous and ecologically destructive in human history. We could call it the war, air and fiscal crimes tribunal and we could put politicians and CEOs and major media owners in the dock with earphones like Eichmann and make them listen to the evidence of how they killed millions of people and almost murdered the planet and made most of us far more miserable than we needed to be. Of course, we wouldn't have time to go after them one by one. We'd have to lump Wall Street investment bankers in one trial, the Council on Foreign Relations in another, and any remaining Harvard Business School or Yale Law graduates in a third. We don't need this for retribution, only for edification. So there would be no capital punishment, but rather banishment to an overseas Nike factory with a vow of perpetual silence.' ‚Äì Sam Smith 'I have come to think of the export of 'democracy' as the contemporary equivalent of what missionaries have always done in the interest of conquering and occupying the 'uncivilized' world on behalf of the powers that be. I have said that the 'church' invented the concept of conversion by any means, including torture and killing of course, as doing the victims a big favor, since it was in the interest of 'saving' their immortal souls. It is now called, 'democratization'.' ‚Äì Rita Corriel 'It is more or less impossible to commemorate the war dead without glorifying them, and it is impossible to glorify them without glorifying their wars.' ‚Äì Paul Craig Roberts Any part of this report may be disseminated without permission, provided attribution to William Blum as author and a link to williamblum.org is provided.

Share This: BY NILE BOWIE T he outcome of strangest and most consequential election cycle in recent American history will soon be upon us. Regardless of who becomes the next president, this election will forever be synonymous with the rogue candidacy of Donald Trump and the demographic shifts that have emboldened the right. Though it may be a close election, it is widely presumed that public antipathy towards Trump ‚Äì the first major party candidate who is near-universally opposed by both major parties ‚Äì will tilt the odds in Hillary Clinton's favour. Nonetheless, Trump's support base of primarily white, blue-collar Americans will be a major factor for the political establishment to contend with in the years ahead. These voters are frustrated by their economic marginalisation wrought by neoliberal trade deals and economic policies and are contemptuous of traditional political elite, their internationalism and liberal identity politics. For these voters, fear of immigration is entwined with the precarity of being working class, their troubling prejudices notwithstanding. Economic disempowerment and political disenfranchisement have accelerated under President Obama, to the detriment of the American middle class. White, blue-collar Americans have witnessed the offshoring of their jobs and the erosion of their status in society, and Trump has masterfully stroked their resentment and discontent by playing on their fears of Muslims, immigrants and minorities. Trump's views often contain unusual contradictions and seem to be delivered impromptu. What remains consistent are his authoritarian views on crime and justice, vows to close the borders to refugees, Muslims and economic migrants, scepticism of overseas 'democracy promotion' and America's role in international alliances, foreign policy views both isolationist and belligerent and of course, his distinctive megalomaniacal hubris. Trump's real problem with the Washington establishment is that he isn't part of it. His campaign represents an insurgent faction of the oligarchical class that aims to displace and replace the standing political elites. Bipartisan opposition to Trump is grounded in the belief that he would be an unreliable proxy and a liability, someone too narrow and unpredictable to manage the common affairs of the ruling class and the US deep state. Moreover, the US establishment is not interested in being led by such a contentious figure, who would draw protest and public opposition in a way that more conventional establishment candidates largely do not. For example, Trump's rhetoric on immigration seems to engender more public outrage than the immigration policy under Obama, who has deported more people than any other president in history. That being said, Hillary Clinton is a more dangerous candidate in many ways. Trump understands that the political system is rigged and the economy is oriented to serve various elite interests, a message that resonates across the political spectrum, even with anti-Trump segments of the electorate. As a hated political outsider not tied directly into the power and the money structure of the political system, there would be no shortage of gridlock and checks on the authority wielded by Trump in the unlikely event that he becomes president. By contrast, Clinton wields enormous political influence inside the corridors of political and corporate power through personal relationships and connections. Policy and legislation shaped by donor money, lobbyist groups and special interests have been a hallmark of the Clintons' time in public office. The very fact that she is standing for office while being investigated by the FBI, having committed actions that would have ended the careers of other politicians and government employees, speaks for itself. It has been reported by various sources that the FBI's recent decision to reopen the investigation into the Clinton email scandal less than two weeks before election day has been motivated by an internal backlash within the agency's rank and file, forcing FBI director James Comey's hand as a means of addressing internal critics who believe he buried the Clinton probe for political reasons. Clinton's email scandal is not the real issue. She has spent her political career ruthlessly advancing the interests of high finance, the military industrial complex and corporate America, with dramatic repercussions for minorities and the marginalised inside the United States, and the civilian populations of countries targeted for US military intervention and destabilization during the her time as an influential first lady, senator and secretary of state. Clinton has spent her long career advocating hawkish US military supremacy and banking deregulation, expanding the private prison industry to the detriment of impoverished African-American communities, dismantling the social safety net that marginalised families rely on, and enabling the consolidation of corporate power through secretive trade agreements. On the campaign trail, she has characterised her work as advancing the interests of women and families. Rather than addressing the political substance of revelations uncovered by WikiLeaks, the Clinton campaign, backed by Obama administration officials, has reverted to neo-McCarthyism by labelling opposition voices as surrogates of Russia, explicitly accusing Moscow of meddling in the US election process. The Clinton campaign has repeatedly evoked the historic struggle for civil rights and aspirational rhetoric of 'breaking glass ceilings' in the interest of a faux-feminism which prioritizes the equal opportunities of women to lead the nation's highest office, while at once tone-deaf to the consequences faced by women and families on the receiving end of executive policies. The Democratic Party has become a parody of moral posturing, self-relishing its candidates with rhetoric that has no connection with policies in reality. It is the party of establishment insiders and corporate donors who openly engineer the presidential nomination process to favour their preferred candidate by virtue of the undemocratic super-delegate system. Bernie Sanders, whose campaign inspired millions of Americans for good reason, has proven himself to be tepid and cowardly in the face of practices that have proven beyond doubt that the Democratic Party establishment conspired against him. Bernie's campaign centred around a rather modest, comparatively tame centre-left progressive platform that did not seriously question US militarism and the values of American exceptionalism. For the Democratic Party at large, the Sanders campaign represented a concession too far. The Clinton campaign even had the impudence to directly hire disgraced Democratic chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz after leaked emails exposed her partisanship. Rather than addressing the political substance of revelations uncovered by WikiLeaks, the Clinton campaign, backed by Obama administration officials, has reverted to neo-McCarthyism by labelling opposition voices as surrogates of Russia, explicitly accusing Moscow of meddling in the US election process. Accusations of Russian interference without accompanying evidence are at best a short-sighted means of deflecting responsibility for the corrupt actions of the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party insiders. The next American president will have to confront the realities of strained relations with Russia. Clinton is known for her public enmity toward Russian President Vladimir Putin and would at best perpetuate the status quo of mutual distrust and limited cooperation. At worst, her policies could risk a military confrontation with Russia should she pursue the establishment of a no-fly zone over Syrian airspace, which she publically advocated during the presidential debates. Trump is the most prominent American political figure to advocate d√©tente with Russia, openly breaking with his neoconservative running mate Mike Pence. Trump has criticised Clinton for supporting anti-government insurgents in Syria and called for jointly targeting ISIS with the Russian, and by extension, Syrian militaries. Trump, being very critical of Iran, also signalled he was willing to fight against ISIS on the same side as Tehran. He has also offered support for the establishment of a safe zone inside Syrian territory, potentially in cooperation with the Syrian government and its allies. Both candidates would pursue a different policy approach from the incumbent administration in Syria, but Clinton's no-fly zone holds greater potential to deepen military hostilities between major powers. Clinton has generally been critical of Obama's foreign policy in Syria and elsewhere for not asserting US power strongly enough. Despite the differences in style and demeanour, the range of policies offered by the entrenched two-party system is limited to varying shades of centre- to far-right. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are the least trusted and most unpopular presidential candidates in modern history. Despite the public disillusionment with major party candidates, it remains to be seen whether American voters will cast ballots for third parties such as the Libertarian Party or Green Party, which are seeking to garner 5 percent of the popular vote to become eligible to receive public campaign funding. More likely than not, American voters will cast their ballots 'against' Trump by voting for Clinton and vice versa, fueling the cyclical politics of the lesser evil that have been a feature of American presidential elections for decades. More than any other US election in recent history, the candidates represent the rot of an American political establishment marred by scandal, hypocrisy and the relentless pursuit of hegemony. To advocate one over the other is ultimately defeatist.

8. Emigre Super Blocs Part VIII:The Quasi-Legal Coup-Hillary Clinton Information Operations In Election 2016 . 'The purpose of ' Inform and Influence Operations ' is not to provide a perspective, opinion, or lay out a policy. It is defined as the ability to make audiences 'think and act' in a manner favorable to the mission objectives. This is done through applying perception management techniques which target the audiences emotions, motives, and reasoning.
These techniques are not geared for debate. It is to overwhelm and change the target psyche. 
Using these techniques information sources can be manipulated and those that write, speak, or think counter to the objective are relegated as propaganda, ill-informed, or irrelevant. ~ Global Research, US Psychological Warfare in Ukraine .' 
W hat if the strife, rumor, and clamor that the world has seen in the presidential campaign were part and parcel of an Inform and Influence Operation against Americans to determine the election outcome? Bear with me for a moment as I lay out the proofs. The quote above is from an early 2015 article with the author showing what it could look like in the civilian world. 
' What would we do? Disrupt, deny, degrade, deceive, corrupt, usurp or destroy the information. The information, please don't forget, is the ultimate objective of cyber. That will directly impact the decision-making process of the adversary's leader who is the ultimate target.' ‚Äì Joel Harding 
IO or IIO (Inform and Influence Operations) as defined by the US Army includes the fields of psychological operations and military deception. All of this is used in the civilian world the same way by private contractors. 
In this election, private contractors were hired to focus their capacity to influence the American population. This is proven and you deserve a step by step look at it if you are voting. 
What Project Veritas shows is damning evidence of what I have been documenting in the emigre series articles since spring 2016. 
By using mainstream media, they started an integrated approach which includes influencing their political opponent's decision making. Media is given messages that follow the same themes and fill the entire information space by using an across the board effort. The effort drowns out any other message. 
According to the Observer, this has been happening throughout the election cycle to benefit Hillary Clinton. ' Rather than informing voters to enrich democracy , the mainstream media has developed a feedback loop between support for particular candidates and the political agenda they intend to support. The freedom of the press is necessary for a democracy to function.' The article further points out that it was the media that helped rig the primaries against Bernie Sanders. 
Wikileaks has clearly shown the interplay between mainstream media and the Clinton campaign. And they have shown clearly that most of the mainstream media are working to influence the election . This goes beyond partisan electioneering. All of this follows the exact pattern, a well planned Information Operation against the American public . 
As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was also the Ex-Officio Board Member of the BBG . The BBG (Broadcasting Board of Governors) run RFE/RL (Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty). Most of the 8-member board, appointed by the President of the United States, are the who's who of powerful media moguls in film, news, print, and radio. Appointment to the BBG is like being awarded an ambassador position for the media industry. It's also why big media carries the same line or themes. 
The 7th member of the board of directors which runs RFE/RL is Mathew Armstrong . He is a longtime friend and mentor to retired Brigadier general Joel Harding. He provides Harding a lot of access and influence in media. Armstrong's background is public relations. He is an expert in IO and IIO operations. His bio: Author, lecturer, and strategist on public diplomacy and international media . He has worked on traditional and emerging security issues with both civilian and military government agencies, news organizations, think tanks, and academia across several continents. 
In what appears to be a conflict of interest, at least two BBG board members are working actively for the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. 
Karen Kornbluh is helping refine and to get Hillary Clinton's message out. ' All of them are names to watch if Clinton wins ‚Äî and key jobs at the FCC and other federal agencies are up for grabs.' 
According to her bio : Karen founded the New America Foundation's Work and Family Program and is a senior fellow for Digital Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. Karen has written extensively about technology policy, women, and family policy for The Atlantic , The New York Times and The Washington Post . New York Times columnist David Brooks cited her Democracy article 'Families Valued,' focused on 'juggler families' as one of the best magazine articles of 2006. Michael Kempner is the founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of MWW Group, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, and may get a greater role if she is elected . Kempner is a member of the Public Relations Hall of Fame. Michael Kempner hired Anthony Weiner after the sexting scandal broke in 2011. 
Jeff Shell, chairman of the BBG and Universal Filmed Entertainment is supporting a secondary role by being an honor roll donor to the Atlantic Council . While the BBG is supposed to be neutral it has continuously helped increase tensions in Eastern Europe. While giving to the Atlantic Council may not be illegal while in his position, currently, the Atlantic Council's main effort is to ignite a war with Russia. This may set up a major conflict of interest. 
According to journalist Robert Parry 'The people that will be taking senior positions and especially in foreign policy believe 'This consensus is driven by a broad-based backlash against a president who has repeatedly stressed the dangers of overreach and the need for restraint, especially in the Middle East.' 
Parry goes on to say that at the forefront of this is the Atlantic Council, a think tank associated with NATO. Their main goal is a major confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. 
The Atlantic Council is the think tank for the CEEC (Central and Eastern European Coalition) which is associated with NATO. The CEEC has only one goal. The question it poses to candidates that mattered is 'Are you willing to go to war with Russia?' Hillary Clinton has received their unqualified support throughout the campaign. 
The Central and Eastern European Coalition represent the various Central and Eastern European countries to the US government. What makes them special in an election is that they control a 20 million person strong bloc vote in key states across the country and sway elections by themselves. The price of a Clinton win is war with Russia. 
While the rest of the BBG board support Clinton's proposed policy of closing Syrian airspace, the CEEC wants it because it will mean direct conflict with Russia. Hillary Clinton's first foray into Islamic politics led to genocide and made the way for ISIS setting up training camps in Kosovo. Hillary Clinton has been friendly with jihadists for as long as she has had a national political career. According to US Special Forces on the ground in Syria training the moderates, there are NO moderates to train . 
Green Berets are forced to train jihadis that they know will eventually attack us. Support our troops? Give them good, honorable missions. They deserve better, don't they? 
As you go through the above links, the information is staggering. Shown are large groups of people strategically located in swing states that will do anything to get her elected. The question is why? 
Politically, we have a two party system. If you say you are Republican, people have at least a general idea of what you mean. For Democrats, it's no different. There are different kinds of politics that fit easily under each umbrella. But the point is they are recognizable and we know where they stand on issues. 
Tell me, what are OUNb beliefs? OUNb is a political party and set of beliefs just like Republican or Democrat. The reason I am asking is that you can't tell me. The odds are you haven't heard about it before. When the Atlantic Council or The Project for the New American Century takes all the senior positions in the Clinton White House, it will be filled with OUNb and similar political partisans for the first time without dissenting voices. 
'Unity to act when required has been the diaspora's mantra ‚Äì this cannot be disputed . 
As time moves on, we see that things take a natural course. We see that two wings of the OUN ‚Äì (OUNb)Banderivtsi and (OUNm)Melnykivtsi ‚Äì are working actively on the international level, working in partnership and currently are in strong negotiations about becoming a single entity again.' 
The OUNb political party started under Stepan Bandera and their political beliefs are quite literally Nazi. In the 1930's they swore undying loyalty to Adolf Hitler and the Diaspora was directing Waffen SS battalions from America secretly even as other Ukrainian emigres were fighting them. The UCCA is the head of OUNb thought in America and now they want America to celebrate their totalitarian beliefs with them. If you disagree with totalitarian politics, you are the enemy. After a brief description of what kind of beliefs the people have from the Atlantic Council that are taking up cabinet positions, the proof it is happening now follows. 
The OUNb were the SS that manned the concentration camps during the Holocaust. They successfully murdered 3 million war prisoners by starving them to death. The OUNb killed over 250,000 Jews, 500,000 Ukrainians, and committed the first Holocaust at Babi Yar. Today the UCCA is funding and running the volunteer battalions raping and killing in Donbass the same way. 
They and the other emigre group leaders are also behind buying the media headlines and reach, damage control, and the Information Operation against Americans today. If you want to know what American politics will look like within a few years, look at Ukraine. 
There are people who live abroad, who do not feel fully accepted as a minority, and here there is a phenomenon which I call long-distance nationalism. . .The members of the diaspora create for themselves an image of the home land, which is a stronger emotional investment than the country in which they live‚Ä¶One negative consequence of the diaspora experience is the emergence of what Ander-son calls non-responsible politics: diaspora participation in the politics in the country with which they identify can often be toxic, and their impact can be felt through the funding of particular political figures, nationalist propaganda, and even weapons‚Ä¶- Multiculturalism, memory, and ritualization: Ukrainian nationalist monuments in Edmonton, Alberta ‚Äì Pers Anders Rudling 
With the field day the Emigres and paid media had with Donald Trump over David Duke, they forgot to tell you that Ukrainian emigres supporting Hillary Clinton hired Duke in Ukraine as a professor of history and sent their American kids to learn there. Almost all Ukrainian politicians have been through this fascist education system known as MAUP . The Ukrainian American and other likeminded ethnics are the people that will fill the senior foreign and domestic cabinet positions. 
' OUNb leader Ivan Kobasa also took responsibility of making sure the Ukrainian-Americans received the proper secondary education at Ukrainian nationalist schools(MAUP) in Ukraine. From the mid-2000's enrollment in this educational system has skyrocketed into the hundreds of thousands. Today almost all members of the current Ukrainian government are graduates of this ideological system that was taught to them by moderates like David Duke who is also a graduate of the MAUP system.' 
'I do care about social and economic issues affecting every American, but given the war in Ukraine, there is only one issue that we as Ukrainian Americans must focus on: Ukraine . 
The Ukrainian issue 'trumps' all other personal issues! 
A vote for Trump is a vote against Ukraine! 
When it comes to U.S. elections, Ukrainian Americans are a statistically minor, divided, unorganized voting group. The Central and East European Coalition is a coalition of U.S.-based organizations that represent their countries of heritage, a voting group of over 20 million people. The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America and the Ukrainian National Association are member organizations of the CEEC. Americans of East and Central European heritage can make a significant difference and influence the election result if their attention is focused.' Ukraine Weekly The Presidential Election: Can We Make A Difference 
Hillary Clinton's response is she will defend Ukraine's borders! Even though it has no eastern or northern border to defend. She has guaranteed to start a war with Russia if she is elected. 
Not only is Clinton buying the media through these second parties, but they are hiring professional, former military psyops professionals to deny pertinent information from voters and disrupt her political opponents message. At the same time, they are paying an across the board mainstream media to simultaneously publish articles and video that lift her campaign up, disrupt, destroy, and drown out alternate messages. 
Wikileaks noted this when it exposed the Clinton campaign's program to incite violence and obfuscate the point. The Huffington Post example of this is' Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar , rampant xenophobe , racist , misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ‚Äî 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ‚Äî from entering the U.S'. 
' We understand the Clinton camp has hired beaucoup and Zwanzig (a lot) of trolls, we also understand the Kremlin has done the same. We just do not know if Trump has followed suit. From a counterintelligence perspective, this is confusing as heck. 
One of the really neat things about this election is seeing all my information operations and information warfare friends on social media, contributing and commenting, looking darned intelligent! Theirs is normally the voice of reason, maturity, and intelligence.' Joel Harding 
By systematically and continually attacking the voter's psyche, Americans are being treated in the same way our government treats countries they overthrow . The right to make an informed vote has been denied to support any particular candidate. 
What does an Inform and Influence Operation entail against the American public? Read the following carefully. The term 'anti-western' refers to anyone that disagrees with whom he is working for. In this case, he works for the Ukrainian Emigres. This also covers Syria. Every media outlet or journalist writing about these subjects that aren't carrying the line he lays out is the enemy. These are the tactics being used today during the election. 
'I am building a database of planners , operators, logisticians, hackers, and anyone wanting to be involved with special activities I will call ‚Äòinform and influence activities'. I have received a few different suggestions to help organize operations ‚Äì of all sorts ‚Äì against anti-Western elements. No government approval, assistance or funding. This skirts legalities. This is not explicitly illegal and it may not even be legal, at this point. That grey area extends a long way. I am only trying to assess the availability of people willing to participate in such efforts. Technology, equipment and facility offers are also appreciated.

If you don't think this is possible , this has been going on around you for a long time. look at the credentials of retired Brigadier General Joel Harding and decide for yourself. But first look at what he promises he can do for you when you hire him.

With his resume, no guess work is needed to understand how effective his friends are. Before going further, ask yourself if this is what elections are supposed to be? 
As a litmus test take Hillary's name out and put down what is known just through Wikileaks in a list. Put McCain's name, Kucinich, Paul, Bush, and ask yourself would this be an acceptable candidate? Add what's been shown here. Is there an acceptable candidate? 
If any of them would be acceptable, sorry like many others you drank the kool-aid already. 
' I've seen how our heroes, activists , journalists, and celebrities have completely sold their souls to support something no person with an iota of morality would do. I've seen them say and do things to derail candidates who would have been a million times better for those less fortunate around us. It's unfortunate most pretend to fight the establishment, to act like they love the people more than they love the struggle and the relevance that it brings them. I am not one of those and I won't continue to be until the good Lord takes me.' Cesar Vargas 
Hillary Clinton is not a Nazi. But every position of relevance will be filled with people that really are political Nazis. They are technically integral nationalists. They look down on democracy in any form. At least now you know what kind of government you are voting for. 
Regardless of who wins, there are 2000 tanks, artillery, and rockets pointed my way, waiting for this election to be over. I am an American that lives in Donbass, and wrote many of the early breaking stories and much of the background about the conflict in Ukraine. 
If you cannot objectively look and see a more sophisticated version of what happened here through 2014 is going on, I can't help you. Soon the OUNb will order the volunteer battalions to start killing civilians on a large scale again. I will go back to reporting on the war. 
If all these things weren't being done, I would keep it simply about policy. Russia is not an enemy of the United States. Instead, I believe I am witnessing a quiet coup that demands legality in America. 
If this Information Operation is allowed to win the 2016 presidency, then elections are fruitless. Every other election will be based on the same strategy. They will have to be for any candidate to win.

Share This: B y ANDREW COCKBURN T he intrusion of the FBI into the 2016 presidential election may have come as a shock to most people, but it should not have surprised anyone who has spent time in the Oval Office. Stretching back to the days of J. Edgar Hoover, presidents have learned, sooner or later, that while they may revel in the title of 'Chief Executive,' their command of coercive bureaucracies, such as the FBI and the intelligence agencies, along with the military services, and others, is limited at best. ABOVE: FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover succeeded in holding power for life by bribing politicians with his knowledge of their sins and crimes. He himself was a reactionary and closet gay man. At worst, presidents may find these powerful institutions actively colluding with their political enemies. Currently, we have credible reports of agents in the New York FBI Field Office defying their nominal superiors in the justice department to dig with zeal into the Clinton Foundation on the basis of nebulous leads from a partisan and largely discredited screed by a former Bush speechwriter. Richard Nixon would have found this a familiar scenario. Early in his presidency, he came to appreciate how little control he exerted over the assorted fiefdoms of the intelligence and law enforcement bureaucracies. His solution was to set up a whole new police agency with extraordinary powers, the Drug Enforcement Administration, using the cover of a war on drugs, that would be under his direct control. Recognizing this for the threat it was, the entrenched institutions struck back, crippling Nixon with media leaks, notably those from 'Deep Throat', deputy FBI director Mark Felt. Sometimes the hobbling of executive power may emanate not from widely recognized instruments of power, such as the FBI, but from more obscure but nonetheless potent corners of the enforcement universe. Thus the Obama Administration's signature foreign policy achievement, the agreement to limit Iran's uranium enrichment program, is currently being actively undermined by a little-known branch of the U.S. Treasury, OFAC, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which supervises the enforcement of US sanctions around the world. Under the agreement hammered out by Secretary of State John Kerry in July 2015, Iran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in return for the lifting of an array of economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other western powers in recent years. The most onerous of these controls were those enjoining banks from doing business with nominated Iranian banks and other entities, with savage penalties levied on anyone who infringed the rules. The effect has been to deter international banks from doing any business of any kind with Iranian banks, for fear of inadvertently triggering a billion dollar fine from the U.S. sanctions police. Recognizing that the Iranians might lose faith in the agreement if promised rewards from the ability to trade freely with the rest of the world do not appear, the Obama Administration has taken steps to remedy the situation, or thinks it has. Speaking recently at a ceremony in London honoring his role in negotiating the deal, Kerry announced that so long as banks make a pro forma effort to ensure they were not dealing with a sanctioned institution (there are still plenty of those) OFAC would not penalize them even if it turned out they were wrong. 'OFAC‚Ä¶ has made it very, very clear that if you do due diligence in the normal fashion,' said Kerry, 'and later it turns out it was some unenforceable entity that pops up, you will not be held accountable for that.' Except that OFAC has different ideas. As detailed by attorney Tyler Cullis, a specialist in sanctions regulations, writing in the blog SanctionLaw, OFAC states on its own website that the 'normal' due diligence cited by Kerry is absolutely not 'necessarily sufficient.' Instead, Treasury's Acting Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Adam Szubin, OFAC's boss, has made it clear that anyone doing banking business with Iran had better exercise ' enhanced (my emphasis) due diligence,' essentially meaning they have to prove their counterparties are pure as the driven snow, or they will get it in the neck. The consequences are predictable; international banks will deem it smart to pay attention to the sanctions cops rather than the diplomat and steer clear of Iranian business, with consequent disillusionment over the deal in Iran and the neutralizing of a key administration success. As Nixon might have said, par for the course.

ABOVE: Image by DonkeyHotey | CC BY 2.0 'We must develop a principled opposition to US imperialist policy [in Syria], without prevarications. The task falls on the left, but it cannot be a left divided by relativist consideration of 'evil' on all sides‚Ä¶' W hy are they lying? Everything is being done to convince the public that Russia wants war; that it has annexed Ukraine; that it will attack Western Europe; that it will crush the Baltic states and Poland in its advance; that it's committing war crimes in Syria; that Assad is a dictator and a butcher; that he has met peaceful demands for reform with brutal repression; that those fighting Assad are moderate rebels; that he is dropping barrel bombs on civilians. Why are they lying? Because the people don't want war: they want jobs and bread. They will not agree to murder people who have done them no harm. They will consent to war if told they are under attack or that the war will save other people from genocide, rape, or other gross violations of human rights. The people are not interested in world domination, but the elite are. The people are, therefore, the enemy within. They must be persuaded to support the elite's plan by perverting their decency. They must be made to cringe in fear. They must be made to believe that war‚Äîany war‚Äîwill be defensive. This is the tactic of terrorists: terrorizing the population to obtain political ends. Hillary Clinton is lying: a no-fly zone in Syria will not 'save lives.' In her last presidential debate, Clinton said that she wants a no-fly zone in Syria because it will 'save lives': 'I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria, not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians.' The 'leverage' she is seeking is Russian roulette with the planet. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dunford, noted in response that a no-fly zone in Syria might trigger a war with Russia, a nuclear power. Neither does she believe that a no-fly zone will save lives. In a closed-door speech to Goldman Sachs in 2013, Clinton said: 'To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we're not putting our pilots at risk‚Äîyou're going to kill a lot of Syrians.' She knows what is at stake with a no-fly zone in Syria, and yet she tells us the opposite of what she knows will happen. In other words, she's lying. What has changed Clinton's mind since 2013? In 2013, there was no need to risk nuclear war over Syria. The so-called Free Syrian Army and assorted rebel groups were doing just fine in their offensive. In 2013, Syria stood alone, apart from some Iranian assistance. Until 2015, the Assad government was on its last breath, in retreat from the provinces of Raqqa, Aleppo, Hama, Idlib, and Latakia. By September 2015, the generous financial, military, and operational support by the United States, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey to the 'anti-Syrian coalition'‚Äì Islamic State, the Jabbat al-Nusra, the 'Free Syrian Army'‚Äìwas paying great dividends in advancing the destabilization of the Assad government. Soon, it could be expected that the symbolic head of Assad would sit on a silver platter in the White House, along with other colonial trophies. In their obsession to vilify Trump, who certainly deserves a lot of manure for his innumerable character flaws and vile political ideas, the Democrats and other liberals massing under Hillary's 'Big Tent', have totally forgotten Hillary's many crimes and also embraced the demonization of Putin and Russia, a different game altogether, and one with huge risks for humanity. The Orwellian assault on Russia is part of a filthy propaganda line floated by the warmongering Neocons Imperialists, of which Hillary is a card-carrying member. But self-righteous stupidity, and lopsided vision is the very trademark of Democratic party liberals and fellow water carriers. The saddest and most disturbing part of this abject campaign without precedent in its degree of filth even for American standards, is that even people who normally know better have embraced it, as this disgraceful cartoon by the normally lucid Dan Perkins (Tom Tomorrow comic strip) sadly proves. (Click image for best resolution). The humanitarian consequences for Syrians, however, were catastrophic. Fleeing the terror of a Syria in the clutches of cutthroat mercenary armies, refugees flooded Turkey, Jordan, Greece, and other countries, becoming human barter between Turkey and the European Union. The EU paid Turkey two billion euro to keep within its borders this human avalanche of 'collateral damage.' That was the situation in September of 2015, when Russia, invited by the legitimate Syrian government, legitimately intervened in Syria with aircraft, support personnel, military advisors and equipment. In a year of Russian efforts to establish a premise for a peaceful solution in Syria by eliminating the militant rabble the Western chorus of 'Assad must go' has mutated into a furious hiss of impotent rage. No one expects Assad to go now, unless the US comes up with a strategy to reverse the losses the Russian intervention has inflicted. In a year of Russian efforts to establish a premise for a peaceful solution in Syria by eliminating the militant rabble the Western chorus of 'Assad must go' has mutated into a furious hiss of impotent rage. Enter Hillary's reversal on the no-fly zone, which now, contrary to her judgment in 2013, will 'save lives.' What is a no-fly zone? A no-fly zone is a coercive appropriation of the partial airspace of a sovereign country. It is the arbitrary creation of a demilitarized zone in the sky to prevent belligerent powers from flying in that air space. In Syria, the 'belligerent power,' ironically, would be the internationally recognized legitimate Syrian government and its legitimate ally, Russia. According to former UN Secretary Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in an interview with John Pilger, a no-fly zone is illegal under international law. No-fly zones are post-Soviet inventions. The measure was never proposed, used, or authorized to this day by the UN Security Council until the Soviet Union virtually dissolved. This restraint was exercised by the US for the excellent reason that no such aggression on a sovereign state would have been tolerated without massive fuss at the UN Security Council and a bad rap for the US. There have been only three instances of a no-fly zone so far, all in the wake of the disappearance of the USSR: Iraq (1991-2003), Bosnia (1993-95), and Libya (2011), all initiated on the hypocritical pretense of 'saving lives.' What is Plan B? I n one word: escalation. Apart from partitioning the air space of Syria, Plan B would provide for supplying, through Qatar or Saudi Arabia, man-portable air defense systems to the 'moderate opposition,' including if it is acknowledged that the 'moderate opposition' has allied itself openly with the al-Nusra front. Plan B has not been approved, but the media has floated a series of reports throughout October as being under consideration. On October 28, the New York Times published an astonishing conclusion about an aspect of the Obama administration's strategy in Syria, though gently and benevolently worded. The Times indicated that it was being felt that Obama had insufficiently armed the 'moderate opposition,' so that in Aleppo it had 'no choice' but to partner with al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fatah al-Sham (formerly al-Nusra) to fight off Putin and Assad. At the same time, Reuters noted that the Obama administration had formerly considered arming the 'moderates' with anti-air missiles but was constrained by the fear that such weapons would fall in the hands of 'extremists.' Such reports suggest, rather boldly, I think, that 'former restraint' might have to give way to greater support for the 'moderate' militants, including if they partner with 'extremists.' Thus, we arrive at a point of utter bewilderment in which we verify the absurdity of launching a War on Terror to end up fighting a War with Terror. Oppose US imperialism I t is good and proper that we should denounce Hillary Clinton for her vile record of regime change (in Honduras), crime of aggression (Libya), threats to Russia and China, corruption, illegality, and abuse of power. She's clearly unfit to be president of any decent country that calls itself democratic. However, fixating on her individual agency lets the policy off the hook. The US is not yet a banana republic, in which the patriarch of some rich landowning family becomes the patriarch-autocrat of a country. An intricate network of powerful interests, which determine the policy, rules the US, frantic to maintain global economic and military dominance. This ruling class selects the candidate who will best carry out the policy. Hillary Clinton will be the servant of the interests of the ruling class of which she is a member. She will be their president. So it's the policy that must be opposed, and this policy is imperialist. We must develop a principled opposition to this policy, without prevarications. The task falls on the left, but it cannot be a left divided by relativist consideration of 'evil' on all sides. However we may feel about the morality of governments in Russia, China, Syria, Iran, etc., one thing is clear: they did not launch a war on Iraq, opening the door to all the crimes that followed from that original crime. It is time to decide whether we want to live with things as they are or change them. And we must begin by changing them at home.

Share This: Dispatches from Eric Zuesse O n November 7th, a Morning Consult and Politico poll of early voters showed Donald Trump to be overwhelmingly viewed by early voters as being the more dangerous of the two major-Party candidates. The mega-corporation Alphabet, formerly known as Google, deserves a lot of the credit for that result, on candidate Hillary Clinton's behalf ‚Äî against, first, Bernie Sanders, and, now, Mr. Trump. Eric Schmidt, the billionaire Chairman and top executive of Alphabet Corporation, has been behind the scenes working for her campaign all along, and will be beyond being the most powerful person in the world (which he already was) if she wins. On 1 February 2016, FORTUNE bannered, 'Google's Parent Seizes Apple's Crown As Most Valuable U.S. Company' , and that understated the reality: it's been actually the entire world's most valuable company ever since that time (and not merely the 'Most Valuable U.S. Company'). Eric Schmidt: One of the billionaires who control our destiny, for the worse. 
Schmidt detailed in the recently wikileaked 2014 email to Hillary's campaign, the means for winning both the nomination and the ultimate victory. It was an email to Hillary Clinton's aide Cheryl Mills, dated 15 April 2014 , and was promptly forwarded by her to John Podesta, Hillary's campaign manager. Here is just the opening of it, to indicate the types of matters it addressed: 1. Size, Structure and Timing Let's assume a total budget of about $1.5Billion, with more than 5000 paid employees and million(s) of volunteers. The entire startup ceases operation four days after November 8, 2016. The structure includes a Chairman or Chairwoman who is the external face of the campaign and a President who is the executive in charge of objectives, measurements, systems and building and managing the organization. Every day matters as our end date does not change. An official campaign right after midterm elections and a preparatory team assembled now is best. 2. Location The campaign headquarters will have about a thousand people, mostly young and hardworking and enthusiastic. Its important to have a very large hiring pool (such as Chicago or NYC) from which to choose enthusiastic, smart and low paid permanent employees. DC is a poor choice as its full of distractions and interruptions. Moving the location from DC elsewhere guarantees visitors have taken the time to travel and to help. The key is a large population of talented people who are dying to work for you. Any outer borough of NYC, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Boston are all good examples of a large, blue state city to base in. Employees will relocate to participate in the campaign, and will find low cost temporary housing or live with campaign supporters on a donated basis. This worked well in Chicago and can work elsewhere. The computers will be in the cloud and most likely on Amazon Web services (AWS). All the campaign needs are portable computers, tablets and smart phones along with credit card readers. 3. The pieces of a Campaign a) The Field Its important to have strong field leadership, with autonomy and empowerment. Operations talent needs to build the offices, set up the systems, hire the people, and administer what is about 5000 people. Initial modeling will show heavy hiring in the key battleground states. There is plenty of time to set these functions up and build the human systems. The field is about organizing people, voter contact, and get out the vote programs. .. Then, for example, there's this: .. Partners like Blue State Digital will do much of the fund raising. A key point is to convert BSD and other partners to pure cloud service offerings to handle the expected crush and load. d) Media (paid), (earned) and (social), and polling New tools should be developed to measure reach and impact of paid, earned and social media. The impact of press coverage should be measurable in reach and impact, and TV effectiveness measured by attention and other surveys. Build tools that measure the rate and spread of stories and rumors, and model how it works and who has the biggest impact. Tools can tell us about the origin of stories and the impact of any venue, person or theme. .. and this: .. In the case where we can't identify the specific human, we can still have a partial digital voter id, for a person or 'probable-person' with attributes that we can identify and use to target. As they respond we can eventually match to a registered voter in the main file. This digital key is eventually matched to a real person. It's focused on controlling the outcome regardless of the actual merits of the competing candidates; and Schmidt was an ultimate insider in his knowledge of what companies Podesta should select to carry out the various parts of this operation. (Of course, those companies will then be in a privileged position, alongside Alphabet, serving a Clinton Administration.) S chmidt also was proving to Hillary that in his work for her he was entirely objective in her interests, such as by his recommending Amazon, his big cloud-computing competitor, instead of Alphabet's own cloud-computing service. This is a bipartisan operation, for her, against any and all other candidates. .. Schmidt also was crucially involved in helping in 2011 to plan the coup in Ukraine that Hillary's State Department was then working on, and which culminated successfully in February 2014 . ( Here's Hillary's prot√©g√© Victoria Nuland overseeing the operation and selecting on 4 February 2014 who would be leading the country after the coup: 'Yats' .) This 'democratic revolution' 'featured civic self-organization aided by the use of Internet-based social media, neighborhood initiatives, and online news sites' , and this online operation (directed mainly at rallying Ukraine's anti-Russians, called 'pro-EU' people) fits precisely the 'tech camps' that started inside the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine on 1 March 2013 , after Google's CEO Eric Schmidt and Google's and the U.S. State Department's Jared Cohen, had deceived wikileaks' founder Julian Assange into informing them, on 23 June 2011 , how to foment massive public demonstrations online. As planned (and, of course, Assange had no fore-knowledge of any of this), the coup ended in a very bloody 'false-flag' operation on 20 February 2014, in which Right Sector paramilitaries who had been trained by the rabidly anti-Russian racist Dmitriy Yarosh , and who were dressed as state-security police, shot down upon the crowd and murdered both regular policemen and the protesters, so that the bloodshed would be blamed on the man Obama was trying to oust, the democratically elected President, Viktor Yanukovych (who was lots more popular among Ukrainians than any of the subsequent top leaders of Ukraine have been). .. Then these Right Sector mercenaries massacred an untold number of Crimeans who had been peacefully demonstrating there in Kiev against the anti-government (called 'Maidan') demonstrators, and who fled back into their eight buses that had taken them there from Crimea, back now to Crimea. Yarosh's people blocked the buses at the town of Korsun and murdered some and injured others . This terrified the people in Crimea, which had voted 75% for the very person that the Obama Administration had just overthrown. That massacre was a key precipitating-event for the plebiscite that was then held in Crimea on 16 March 2014, at which over 90% of the residents voted for Crimea to rejoin with Russia, of which it had been a part until the Soviet leader in 1954 arbitrarily transferred Crimea to Ukraine. .. Right Sector thugs (now in plain clothes) were also behind the subsequent 2 May 2014 massacre of the new regime's peacefully demonstrating opponents inside the Trade Unions Building in Odessa ‚Äî the event that sparked the breakaway of yet another region of Ukraine: Donbass. .. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama wanted to control Ukraine because it has the longest border with Russia of any European country and would be ideal for placing missiles aimed at Moscow just a five minutes flight-time away. This was part of a plan that was started actually by U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush on the night of 24 February 1990 and which both Bill Clinton and Bush's son advanced, as did Obama and as will Hillary ‚Äî presumably to the plan's ultimate conclusion, war against Russia. .. It's a massive, decades-long, team-effort, on the part of America's billionaires and their allied billionaires around the world; and, if Clinton wins, then it will be culminated. Eric Schmidt is key to her success in it, and will probably benefit hugely from it, if the conquest can be carried out by non-nuclear means or by 'bluffing' (which, of course, is being carefully gamed-out). But, just in case it goes nuclear, the people who are on the inside have already invested in nuclear bunkers for themselves and their friends and their friends' friends . They are prepared for the worst, but hope for the best (for themselves, at least). About the author =SUBSCRIBE TODAY!

ARTICLE

By Carlos Delgado , Film & Tv critic, wsws.org T he second season of the USA Network television drama Mr. Robot, created by Sam Esmail, concluded recently. Though drawing a somewhat smaller audience than the first season, the show remains popular among critics and has developed a following among young viewers in particular. The series has won a Golden Globe for best drama series, and star Rami Malek won an Emmy award for his portrayal of Elliot Alderson, a security engineer-turned-vigilante hacker who leads a cyberattack on E Corp, described as 'the world's biggest conglomerate.' 
In the first season, Elliot is recruited into the hacker group 'fsociety' by the mysterious Mr. Robot (Christian Slater). Fsociety plots to wipe out the debt records of E Corp in order‚Äì‚Äìin Mr. Robot's words‚Äì‚Äìto 'take down' the 'evil corporation' and incite 'the biggest revolution the world will ever see.' The hack ultimately throws the global financial system into chaos. In a narrative twist, Mr. Robot is revealed to be a mental construct inside Elliot's head, based on memories of his dead father. 
At the start of the second season, Elliot has retreated to his mother's house, seemingly having abandoned his 'revolution' to focus on ridding his mind of Mr. Robot. The cyberattack itself, far from 'taking down' E Corp, has instead caused it to consolidate its power. E Corp CEO Phillip Price (Michael Cristofer) is using the chaos created by the hack to secure a government bailout and to advance Ecoin, the company's proprietary digital currency. 
Meanwhile, the effects of the financial crisis are largely being borne by the population itself. A credit crisis has frozen the accounts of masses of people, and most are forced to subsist on a $50 a day allowance. The economy is in freefall. Major cities have ceased trash collection, leaving mountains of garbage to pile up on city streets. E Corp banks have taken advantage of the loss of data to gouge customers for interest and loan payments that they have already paid. Large protests are a regular occurrence, and social unrest is boiling over. Taken at face value, the show depicts 'revolution' as a cure worse than the disease, one that, at best, is the product of misguided naivet√©; and at worst, inevitably leads one down the road of violence and treachery. 
Darlene (Carly Chaikin) assumes leadership of fsociety. She is determined to 'finish off' E Corp by 'destroying public confidence' in the company, largely through the use of stunts and 'symbolic' protests. Meanwhile, the killing of a key member of fsociety causes the hackers to fear that they are being targeted by the Dark Army, a shadowy group of Chinese hackers who participated in the E Corp cyberattack. At the same time, an FBI investigation led by agent Dom DiPierro (Grace Gummer) is closing in on the fsociety hackers, and the resultant panic and paranoia forms something of a throughline for the season. 
The first season of Mr. Robot suffered from a number of problems, not least of which was a kind of narrative hyperactivity that resulted in a maddening array of subplots, distractions and 'twists.' The series seemed unable to hold its attention on important matters, and the meagerness of the political content, steeped in a kind of shallow anarchism, limited its ability to say much when it did. But the first season also possessed what seemed a sincere outrage at the corporate-financial elite, the 'top one percent of the top one percent' who 'secretly run the world' as Elliot says in the pilot. 
The second season is sharply different in tone. In place of the rapid-fire editing and the pounding, insistent soundtrack, the second season is much quieter and more slowly paced. One gets a sense that the show creators had a desire to settle down and tell a more grounded, perhaps more realistic story. 
They are partially successful in some places. The various scenes that take place among the E Corp elite are generally convincing, with recurring images of financial oligarchs gazing contemptuously‚Äîand nervously‚Äîdown on crowds of protesters from high-rise offices. An atmosphere of foreboding and tension pervades. 
It doesn't take long, however, for the show's attempts at realism to descend into the kind of affected 'darkness' so prevalent in contemporary film. Characters wax pseudo-poetically on the human condition, generally expressing hopelessness and angst. Lines such as, 'We're all just tightrope walking above that pit of ungodly pain that's daring us to trip up,' are par for the course. The scenes themselves are underlit and gloomy, with shots scrubbed of color and framed to make the world seem inescapably isolating and cold. 
Matters are not helped by the scenes involving Elliot's struggle with Mr. Robot, which end up becoming a tedious series of exchanges on the nature of 'truth,' 'reality,' 'illusion,' 'control,' etc. Additionally, Elliot's tenuous grasp on reality gives the show creators free reign to pull the rug out from under the audience whenever they see fit. 
When Elliot states in an internal monologue that 'We trust that [our senses] accurately portray the real world around us. But what if the haunting truth is they can't? That what we perceive isn't the real world at all, but just our mind's best guess? That all we really have is a garbled reality, a fuzzy picture we will never truly make out?' one is hardly surprised. T he change in tone is apparently a deliberate attempt on the part of the show creators to depict the consequences of the first season's 'revolution.' Indeed, the fsociety hackers often express ambivalence, if not outright regret, for their actions in the first season, which everyone agrees have only made things worse.
In the World Socialist Web Site 's initial assessment of the show, we wrote that, 'The idea of 'revolution' and 'revolutionaries' put forward by Mr. Robot is ludicrous ‚Ä¶ In general, the series appears to have little interest, despite the references to inequality, in the conditions of wide layers of the population, much less any conception that masses of people will take part in the process of changing things. This is a 'revolution' carried out by (and presumably for) a layer of disgruntled computer engineers and other professionals.' 
The creators' conceptions have led them from outrage to pessimism. It is no doubt true that a cyberattack like the one depicted in the first season would likely bring about little more than increased state repression. But insofar as the show creators continue to identify these actions with 'revolution' while refusing to see an alternative, they end up condemning the entire notion of revolution itself. Taken at face value, the show depicts 'revolution' as a cure worse than the disease, one that, at best, is the product of misguided naivet√©; and at worst, inevitably leads one down the road of violence and treachery. 
More than a few retrograde elements accompany all this, including the sympathetic portrayal of the FBI and an undercurrent of anti-Chinese chauvinism. 
By the end of the season, some of the fsociety 'revolutionaries' have set out a plan that would include an act of violent terrorism, while others are speculating about the possibility of 'undoing' the effects of the hack and 'putting everything back the way it was.' One has little reason to believe that any of this will turn out well. WITH ORIGINAL SELECT COMMENTS FROM ORIGINAL THREAD (whose opinions we endorse) solerso ' 2 hours ago 
' they end up condemning the entire notion of revolution itself. Taken at face value, the show depicts 'revolution' as a cure worse than the disease, one that, at best, is the product of misguided naivet√©; and at worst, inevitably leads one down the road of violence and treachery.' 
This is a very common and, old trope in popular film and television. It appears frequently in certain kinds of imaginative fiction ‚Äì from Star Trek to the Marvel comics Batman film franchise . The message is that revolutionaries aren't your friends. They don't 'really' want to change the world for the better. According to the trope, revolutionaries are primarily dangerous, selfish, narcissists who are, 'too cowardly' (or too 'lazy') to 'work within the system' for 'real change' . grok ' 11 hours ago 
'More than a few retrograde elements accompany all this, including the sympathetic portrayal of the FBI and an undercurrent of anti-Chinese chauvinism.' 
This is indeed one of the main things about the show which repels me (aside from the usual bourgeois ‚Äî and Hollywood ‚Äî'take' on what 'revolution' actually is): its turning of yet another TV show with initial potential into really just another 'cop' propaganda show: this time portraying the FBI secret police as being (yet again) essentially the 'good guys'. The other is the almost shocking portrayal of the chinese (hackers or their de facto chinese government backers) as being the usual 'inscrutable', 'Yellow Peril' Threat from the East‚Ä¶ 
OTOH some of the best elements of the show ‚Äî aside from the somewhat accurate portrayal of what hacking actually is, and how it is actually accomplished (with eventual, obvious 'product placement'‚Äî the 'Pwn Phone'‚Äî by those who must be technical consultants to the show) ‚Äî are some scenes where even the audience (I did) enters Elliot's disoriented dream state, along with him‚Ä¶ like at the beginning of one episode where he is transported, along with his family, into a 1980's sitcom ‚Äî with an apparent bloody body in the trunk of their car (c/o Mr. Robot), as they take a vacation trip down the turnpike. The author is correct about the weakness of this side of the show ‚Äî leading to too many cheap 'Bobby-Ewing-in-the-shower' moments ‚Äî but this particular one worked out exceptionally well. 
All-in-all, a disappointing promise, turned into yet another police propaganda show, with the big message: 'revolution is futile, kids!' plastered thruout. NOTE: ALL IMAGE CAPTIONS, PULL QUOTES AND COMMENTARY BY THE EDITORS, NOT THE AUTHORS

In this space we aim to offer samples, for the record, as it were, although just about ALL the reporting on the MSM on any topic of interest to the US-led plutocracy‚Äîfrom Syria to the Ukraine and Russia, China, Iran, etc, and reports touching on the nature of the US political system (which the plutocracy and its minions continue to hail as a 'democracy'), history, the economy, etc., are to be regarded as extremely devious and toxic. .. The saddest part is that this enormous machinery of deception‚Äîwhich by design weaves crude and subtle lies in its tapestry‚Äî does have a real and dangerous impact on the way people think here and around the world, and certainly affects the minds and temperaments even of many people who still think of themselves as 'progressive' and well educated.

DISINFORMER OF THE DAY: CBS CORRESPONDENT ELIZABETH PALMER Things to note in this report: ' Palmer is reinforcing the American establishment/Clinton propaganda trope that the Kremlin has actually interfered with the purity of US elections (sic). This is not just a Clinton-disseminated lie, but a lie pushed by the entire US establishment as it prepares the nation for war against Russia, China or any other nation that would dare deviate from or question US global hegemony. ' Palmer, besides having an anti-Russia agenda, like all US 'journalists' is grossly ignorant of the culture it is reporting about, and obviously intellectually lazy. So she gravitates to what is easy, in this case dependable pro-US shills living in Moscow, like the editor of the Moscow Times, an outfit that is simply laughable on its face. This is what she uses to help her audience 'interpret' the reality in Russia. The Moscow Times, with an equivocal agenda, is part of the extensive, underhanded network of US hybrid war assets, along with its notorious global web of NGOs supporting 'color revolutions' in the name of 'democracy,''human rights' and other worthy, high-falutin' concepts.

Share This: Joseph Kishore and David North, wsws.org A s millions of Americans go to the polls today, a mood of anger and frustration prevails throughout the country. On Sunday, CBS News' 60 Minutes featured a focus group discussion of the elections. When asked by pollster Frank Luntz for a word to describe how they felt about the more than a year-and-a-half election campaign, the participants responded: 'terrified,' 'exasperating,' 'horrifying,' 'disgusted' and 'nightmare.' The fact that the two main candidates, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, are the most widely despised in the history of presidential politics has been substantiated in innumerable polls. But the contempt felt toward the two candidates expresses a deeper alienation from the entire structure of official capitalist politics. The candidates and the media have ignored the social, economic and political issues that concern the overwhelming majority of the people. The official election 'debates'‚Äîin which each candidate denounced the other's criminality‚Äîembarrassed and disgusted the electorate. Both Clinton and Trump personify, each in their own way, the corrupt and reactionary character of the political system. What is the choice that has been given the American people? It is hard to say which of the candidates offered by the two parties is more right-wing, the difference being more a matter of style than substance. While the demagogue Trump is trying to direct social discontent along fascistic lines, Clinton is using the cynical narrative of race and gender to provide a 'progressive' mask for an agenda of war and the continuation of economic policies that have guaranteed an endless flow of cash into the pockets of the super-rich. The verdict of Wall Street on its prospects under a Clinton presidency could be seen in the reaction of stock markets to the announcement by FBI Director James Comey that the agency is not pursuing criminal charges against Clinton over her emails. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 371 points. The Clinton campaign has marshaled behind it significant sections of the Republican Party establishment, including many of the neoconservative architects of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The Democratic Party campaign, well aware of its candidate's unpopularity, is relying on the oldest form of political blackmail to bring out the vote for Hillary Clinton. She is, the party and its apologists insist, the 'lesser evil.' As bad as Clinton is, the argument goes, she must be supported to avert the disaster that would inevitably follow the election of Trump. The problem with the 'lesser evil' argument is that it leads to results that are worse than what those who voted one way or the other were hoping to prevent. The 'terrible Trump' theory of American politics explains nothing. The nomination of this absurd and obscene blowhard is itself an outcome of the deep crisis of American society. He is the political equivalent of the metastatic spread of a primary and deadly tumor. Trump is the product of a corporate-dominated political culture, which, for at least the last 40 years, has promoted social backwardness and reaction. However, it is too simple to blame Fox News, talk radio and campaign finance laws for the nomination of Trump. The popular response to his demagogic slogans reflects genuine social distress. Many workers who are planning on voting for him today previously backed the Democratic Party campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. One of the main consequences of Sanders' efforts to channel his 'political revolution' behind Clinton was to guarantee that social anger and hostility to the status quo would be identified with the political right. In the final analysis, Trump's rise is a product of the political bankruptcy of the Democratic Party. Unable to present a positive political message that can attract mass support, Clinton has waged her campaign against Trump on the lowest and most reactionary level. First, the Democrats and their media flacks have denounced Trump as an agent of the Russian president, asserting that Vladimir Putin is seeking to influence the elections by hacking Democratic Party emails. This claim has been endlessly repeated without any factual substantiation. The repackaging of McCarthyite red-baiting, with Russia replacing the Soviet Union, has been used to distract attention from the content of the emails released by WikiLeaks. The Democratic Party campaign, well aware of its candidate's unpopularity, is relying on the oldest form of political blackmail to bring out the vote for Hillary Clinton. She is, the party and its apologists insist, the 'lesser evil.' As bad as Clinton is, the argument goes, she must be supported to avert the disaster that would inevitably follow the election of Trump. More dangerously, the relentless anti-Putin propaganda has been employed by Clinton to legitimize a massive escalation of military operations in Syria and against Russia in the aftermath of the election. The extreme danger of world war, which has been ignored throughout the election, was underscored by the announcement Monday that NATO is placing 300,000 troops on high alert, supposedly in response to Russian aggression. Second, as the election reached its final stage, the Democrats escalated their hysterical slanders based on the claim that Trump's support is coming from 'privileged' white workers motivated by the racist desire to return to an era when they ruled the country. Clinton has centered her campaign on a racialist narrative that denies the deep social anger felt among workers of all races. In terms of social policy, Clinton is pledged to continue the policies of the Obama administration, which has overseen a massive transfer of wealth to the rich and the return of social inequality to the historic levels that prevailed in the first decades of the twentieth century. In the days leading up to the election, millions of workers were confronted with the news that their health insurance premiums will rise by double digits, the outcome of Obama's signature domestic initiative, the misnamed Affordable Care Act. Regardless of the outcome, today's vote will not solve anything. Nothing that happens on Election Day is going to lead to a rise in living standards, resolve any of the great social problems facing the working class, or put an end to the danger of world war. It will only establish the framework for the next stage of the political crisis in the United States. This political crisis will have far-reaching and global consequences. Media commentators internationally have followed what is happening in the United States with a mixture of shock and horror. Edward Luce, writing in the British Financial Times , sums up the prevailing anxiety in a comment published Sunday under the headline, 'American democracy's gravest trial.' The American political system, he writes, is 'teetering, whatever the outcome of the US elections.' Luce asks his readers to 'imagine two kinds of threat: one where a bear [Trump] breaks into your cabin, the other where termites eat it from within.' The good thing about a bear, he writes, 'is that you can see it coming.' In contrast, 'Termites are invisible. It is hard to pinpoint when they began to eat away at the foundation. When and why did Americans lose faith in their system?' The reactionary spectacle of the 2016 elections is the product of protracted decay. Twenty-five years ago, the ideologists of American capitalism proclaimed that the dissolution of the Soviet Union marked the 'end of history,' with the United States, the dominant and unchallenged world power, guaranteeing liberal democracy the world over. If nothing else, this election will forever bury this reactionary fantasy. The crisis confronting the United States today is no less profound than the situation that faced the Stalinist regime in the Soviet Union a quarter-century ago. Four decades of declining living standards and growing social inequality, a quarter-century of unending war, fifteen years of the 'war on terror' accompanied by a vast expansion of the power of the military-intelligence apparatus: These are the pressures that are tearing the democratic fabric apart. Nor is the crisis expressed in this election a uniquely American phenomenon. It is paralleled by global shocks such as the Brexit referendum in Britain, the rise of far-right and fascistic movements throughout Europe, and the general discrediting of political institutions throughout the world. Underlying everything is a crisis of world capitalism, manifested in an expanding imperialist war drive that threatens the entire planet, and the growth of the class struggle, which is the objective foundation for socialist revolution. The time for pragmatic 'lesser evil' politics has long since passed. The pressing and urgent necessity is to build a party of the working class, uniting workers of every race, gender, nationality and ethnicity on a program that represents their class interests.

DISPATCHES FROM DANIEL ESPINOSA working to defeat the Big Lie in all its forms A s the Shipibo community living in Lima loses the very little they have to fire, Luis Casta√±eda, self-appointed 'Best Mayor in Lima's History', breaks his typical silence only briefly, to improvise some of the usual lies. His silence has worked well in the past. Despite having participated in the infamous 'Comunicore' case in his first term as mayor of Lima, back in 2006 -where millions of Peruvian Soles, intended to pay the cities' debts with a contractor, were diverted to a mysterious company with ties to cocaine trafficking- his popularity has always been around a fairly decent 60% percent. ( http://gestion.pe/politica/pese-denuncias-crece-popularidad-castaneda-2173916 ) ABOVE: LIMA‚ÄîShipiba community in CantaGallo. It's been about a year that the authorities offered to relocate them, but so far the government ha snot made good on its promises. (Photo credit: Alessandro Currarino / El Comercio) This is probably his best accomplishment: having been able not only to avoid jail but to earn a second term as Mayor. But Peruvians are short-sighted when it comes to our politicians' obvious venality (we also elected Alan Garc√≠a P√©rez for President twice), and as the popular slogan goes, as long as he develops some visible infrastructure, some public works, for the city, he can very well steal money with impunity. (' Roba pero hace obras ') The superfluous Shipibos Luis Casta√±eda (l), and Jose Pinheiro (El Comercio) The community arrived at Lima by the turn of this century, some of them invited by ex-president Toledo to participate in the popular marches to oust Fujimori from the presidency (2001), others to support their children, some of them studying in Lima, or just looking for better opportunities. Having no means to go back to the Peruvian rainforest in Ucayali, many Shipibo families established themselves near the R√≠mac River, in the island of Cantagallo, right in the center of Lima's most traditional district, where they built precarious housing and started to earn a living by selling the products of their craftsmanship, without asking for anything but basic services. After more than a decade getting used to the extreme differences of living in an overcrowded and polluted city like Lima, and standing in the way of municipal construction works, (Casta√±eda¬¥s favorite projects involve hundreds if not thousands of tons of concrete) they finally asked for relocation when they got fed-up with the noise and started to get sick from the clouds of dust coming from the construction sites. In a stroke of luck, this happened when Casta√±eda was leaving office to make an attempt at becoming President of Peru. The new Mayor, Susana Villar√°n, was more open to the communities' plight. She decided to dedicate a sum of money from the ongoing project affecting the community, 'R√≠o Verde' ('Green River'), to relocate them to a different district, and in agreement with the leaders of the community, closed a deal that, only a couple years later, Casta√±eda decided not to honor. During the first year of Casta√±eda's second term as Mayor, his deputies assured the community that everything was still going as planned, this was in April 2015. Right after that, the commune went 'mute', as Lime√±os have nicknamed their mayor for his reluctance to respond for the many scandals he has been involved in, or establishing open channels to communicate his decisions. Receiving the silence treatment by the authority responsible for their relocation, which, as law demands, also promised to share with them the documents regarding the advancement of the project, they approach the judiciary to start a long and Kafkaesque set of procedures, stating also that: '‚Ä¶some officials show a paternalistic and disrespectful attitude toward us and the people protecting our rights. We are not going to accept this behavior in the next meetings, as we believe in dialogue and respect among peers as a necessity for arriving to a solution. We are being patient despite the terrible toll, both physical and psychological, we are suffering because of the construction works‚Ä¶' ( https://www.facebook.com/limashipibo/posts/895889667140366 ) T his is the kind of treatment native communities suffer in Peru, as they not only contribute very little to the capitalist agenda driving our society, but often stand against the wholesale extractive policies in their ancestral lands. In recent years more than a hundred activists have been murdered, most of them in Honduras, Brazil and Peru. In the scheme where all resources must be exploited, native communities are regarded as 'superfluous' ‚Äîa nagging anachronism‚Äîin the way to economic progress and material profit by corporations and politicians. Some Peruvian journalists protect this kind of politician with the usual hypocritical rhetoric about public moneys being used to fund social projects, something outrageous (yet normal) for mainstream journalists who have forgotten any sense of duty towards the voiceless, but remain fierce defenders of the rights of capital. As anyone with an idea of what propaganda is, or how it works would clearly see, these journalists are chosen because they can incorporate the principles of capitalism and the right of 'second class citizens' to participate in our democracies as cheap labor force, or not at all. Most of these journalists have no other talent than an outstanding tolerance for institutionalized inequality and racism, the kind of character trait some mainstream media seem to look for in their employees: '‚Ä¶you were not born in Lima, ¬øisn¬¥t it? You came from somewhere else, ¬øwhat for? It's as if people from Lima went to Ucayali. I can¬¥t go there and just grab public precincts,' mumbled the renowned homophobe and radio host Phillip Butters, living in a city of almost ten million people, most of them migrants from Peruvian provinces (and being himself one!) who came with very little and 'grabbed' public premises to build their homes. ( http://larepublica.pe/sociedad/819211-phillip-butters-genera-polemica-en-las-redes-sociales-por-su-comentario-sobre-shipibos-de-cantagallo ) Shipibo traditional garments. The Shipibo community is poor, they lack representation in Peruvian politics and 'The Best Mayor in Lima's History' have very little to gain by relocating them or even listening to their plight. As other communities from the Amazon rainforest, they survive through their own talent. Most houses in the Cantagallo shantytown are also independent workshops where the Shipibos make all sorts of traditional handicrafts to sell in their own market. They value their culture above everything else, which among many other principles, leans toward self-sufficiency, creating all the things they need by themselves, and aren't very adept at finding corporate jobs or asking for bank loans, as most people in Lima are. Also in ashes now, they built a bilingual school for their children. Nothing to gain here I t might be useful to understand the logic behind some of Peru's officials, in this case, the only benefit Casta√±eda could attempt to win would be publicity, as a mean to strengthening his already fair popularity. But now that ship has sailed. Even more, some argue that the Shipibos were standing in the way of big profits, as the value of the land where they were being relocated adds up to almost five millions dollars. We are talking about a Mayor who overprices public works, urbanization, and city infrastructure, and who has had shady associations with local and foreign contractors, a fact recently uncovered in another case of corruption involving Brazilian construction companies and Peruvian politicians. (The 'OAS' Case: https://idl-reporteros.pe/el-correo-delator-1/ ) So it is that the site destined for the relocation by former Mayor Villar√°n, was covertly sold by the commune without sharing this detail with the community, as journalist Daniel Yovera revealed a day before the fire ( http://rosamariapalacios.pe/2016/11/05/castenada-vendio-terreno-de-los-shipibos/ ). The money, originally earmarked for them and their children's well-being, went back to the original construction project, instead of to the fund put aside in first place, specifically for the Shipibo's new home, taking them back to where they started. As the OAS case revealed (IDL Reporteros, 10/19/16) one of Casta√±eda's representatives was already planning to cancel the project 'R√≠o Verde' even before he started his second term as Mayor. The President of OAS, Jose A. Pinheiro, was arrested two days after the telephone conversation regarding the cancelation of the project, for crimes in Brazil related to fraudulent concessions in construction works, which means the law applies, somewhere. In the ashes of Cantagallo As the fire is extinguished in Cantagallo, four hundred Shipibo families have lost everything, and Casta√±eda keeps talking through deputies and press aides, only coming out of his 'muteness' to blame the former Mayor, although everything indicates this time he won¬¥t be able to dodge his responsibility for his crimes of negligence by giving Lima the silent treatment. As Lime√±os gather food, water and other supplies for the Shipibos, the outrage against Casta√±eda grows, while marches are being organized in protest. The Shipibos are not leaving Cantagallo, despite the fact that now it represents no more than the ashes of their past, and the memories of loss and indifference. They are afraid they will lose this patch of land near the R√≠mac River if they leave, and dislike the idea of moving to the cluster of tents pitched for them by a commune they distrust.

[White might burning courtesy Informed Content .] =By= Juan Cole W hether Trump wins or loses (and in my view there isn't much chance he can win), he will leave behind a toxic legacy of increased racial and religious hatred, which he has deliberately stirred up in order to take the focus off his policies‚Äì policies that will hurt workers and will throw even more money at the super-wealthy. This use of racism to divide the working class and whip up support for the business classes is as old as American capitalism.
Trump has whipped up sentiment against Latinos and immigrants (a minority of Americans of Latino ancestry is first-generation immigrants) by loudly proclaiming that they are guilty of all kinds of crimes. In fact, violent has fallen 48% in the US since the early 1990s, yet in the past 25 years immigration has soared. Research shows that immigrants commit less crime than the native-born. It isn't hard to figure out why. First, those who don't yet have citizenship are afraid of being deported, so they keep their noses clean. But more importantly, and contrary to what Trump alleges, immigrants are go-getters who have taken the big step of leaving home to accomplish something. They are highly motivated to succeed and often bring with them a great deal of human capital. As for jobs, immigrants aren't stealing them from the native born. They are doing different jobs than locals with the same educational attainments. That's because they often don't have as good English skills or can't afford to turn down menial jobs. The hatred against immigrants Trump has fostered is based on a set of lies, lies that are easily shown to be falsehoods. But it is a little unlikely that this hatred of foreigners will subside Wednesday , whatever happens. 
Trump has given aid and comfort to the American far right. With his racist dog whistles (and often just unadorned racism) he has emboldened the Ku Klux Klan, Alt-right and other disgusting organizations. David Duke of Louisiana has been encouraged to run for the senate and is pledging to be Trump's biggest supporter. This genie will be hard to put back into its lamp. 
Trump has encouraged hatred for Muslims in the US on an unprecedented scale. Hatred for Muslims has already been adopted as a latent platform by the Republican Party, but they are usually at least a little more subtle about it. If Trump can succeed in discriminating against Muslim-Americans, he can then proceed to discriminate against the rest of us on one pretext or another. Muslim-Americans are only 1% of our population. There isn't actually any danger of them taking over the country or imposing their religious law, and most terrorism comes from the far right or from overseas, not from native-born Muslim-Americans. Trump supporters have already burned down a mosque in Florida, have assaulted Muslims (and Sikhs, whose men wear turbans) all over the country, and some Trumpists have plotted terrorism against Muslims. 
Trump has left a legacy of contempt for women and a resurgent patriarchy. He has juvenilized women and hurled slurs at them. He accused Megyn Kelly of being on her period when she asked him sharp questions. He boasted about grabbing strangers by the genitals. His message is that women should be judged not by their intelligence, hard work, or character but by their breast size and figure and the symmetry of their faces. 
Trump has taken optimistic trend lines and pulled them down into Sheol with him. He has diminished our country, traumatized our children, and made us laughingstocks in the urbane capitals of the world. He leaves us a large bequest, tied up with a bow, of hatred and prejudice, smelling like the piece of dog shit that is Donald Trump

[World socialist flag by Frankoko.] Andre Vltchek ‚Äì from Moscow Itinerant Philosopher and Journalist Editor's Note Andre Vltchek's analysis here points out important erosions of left activism, and left activists bear partial responsibility for the tumble into chaos. Hit critiques takes on extra bite in the context of the rise of racism and xenophobia, misogyny, and the crassest brutality, in the United States. It would do everyone well to wake up and carefully look at what is happening to the left. P eople all over the world are fed up with capitalism. They don't always know how to formulate their aversions anymore (the result of a confusing 'education' and disinformation campaign pouring out of the West), but intuitively they are increasingly longing for socialism or even Communism; definitely for some humane, compassionate system based on social justice, kindness and anti-imperialist principles.
Such sentiments are everywhere, in countries as diverse as the Philippines and Bolivia, South Africa and Kirgizstan. 
The rulers and propagandists in the West are well aware of this 'dangerous trend', and they are trying to reverse it with increasing determination ‚Äì even with brutal force. 
In the past, they used to simply try to fully ideologically discredit all socialist and Communist thoughts. Billions of dollars were spent on propaganda and disinformation, on 're-education' of the masses in all corners of the globe, on targeted scholarships and tactics aimed at dividing the Left. This approach was successful, but only to a certain degree. All over the world, the leftist revolutionary ideas would lose some ground for a while, but then they would re-emerge again, often under some new labels and banners. 
Lately, the Empire has begun changing its strategy. Instead of trying to contain its main adversaries, it has decided to exterminate them 'intellectually' once and for all. And how better to do it than by what it always does the best ‚Äì by spreading confusion, nihilism and chaos! 
* 
Instead of attacking socialism and Communism directly, the Empire has begun its massive campaign to discredit most of the countries that are being governed by left-wing governments and movements. This is of course by itself nothing new. What is 'innovative' is that this time Western propaganda has actually began arguing that the anti-imperialist countries are essentially not left wing at all, that they are more capitalist than the West itself, that they are 'anti-people', and sometimes even fascist. 
New derogatory and thoroughly grotesque terms like 'state capitalism' have been invented and put to destructive work. These terms have then been repeated so often that they have become normalized, and eventually been adopted by the Western 'soft left', the liberal media and academia, as well as by the countless 'progressive' but anti-Communist movements ‚Äì including anarchists. 
While I was told by some of the greatest revolutionary figures like Eduardo Galeano and Pramoedya Ananta Toer, that it is time for 'un-dusting the old flags and symbols' (and they were clearly talking about the socialist and Communist ones), the Western official propaganda and much of the Western 'left' were busy spreading their vitriolic but contagious doctrines that 'the labels' should be once and for all declared obsolete. 'I don't want to be part of any political party or any movement', one hears increasingly from millions of couch and cafe revolutionaries in cities like London or Paris. 'I don't like to be labeled'. Or typically so in those places: 'I have my own mind'. 
Except where there are no structures, no strong organization, no labels or flags, there can be no true victory. 
But who cares about victory? Soon it became clear that the 'progressive' Western 'opposition' was not truly seeking to take power or to implement real revolutionary changes. It wanted to 'improve things at home', instead of abolishing the entire monstrous world order. It felt cozy and comfortable being a toothless discussion club, hating everything that was truly fighting, risking life while trying to stop imperialism and the Empire from devouring the Planet. 
Thus was born the grand quiet alliance of the Western establishment (the Empire), the liberals and of those undefined (or of loosely defined) movements like the anarchists. It was directly antagonistic to almost all the countries where the Left was by now holding power. It 'distrusted' leading revolutionary figures. Needless to say ‚Äì the criticism of the world revolutions has been based strictly on Western liberal values and doctrines. 
Those countries that decided to face the Western Empire were generally labeled as un-democratic, as being arch violators of human rights. Socialist nations became the main target of the propaganda. Their every move has been scrutinized, each error blown out of proportion. Grotesquely, the West was, as mentioned above, now criticizing them for 'not being socialist enough, or socialist at all'. It is because the demagogues in London, New York and Paris knew perfectly well that socialism, even Communism, is once again, for many people all over the world a great asset, not liability. 
In the meantime, millions of 'purists' from the pseudo-Left in the West got engaged in endless and pointless theoretical debates about what was or not true socialism and Communism. 
'Is socialism, the Chinese way, truly socialism?' they are repeating, like parrots, all over Europe and North America. 'Is Russia socialist at all, or is it governed by a strongman and by a bunch of selfish oligarchs?' And of course: 'How socialist are countries like Iran or South Africa?' 
The verdict of the purists is always extremely stern. Almost nobody manages to survive the scrutiny! The purists in the West don't hold power, and it is apparent that they don't really want to. They bark. They philosophize. They throw sticks into the wheels of those who are truly and determinedly fighting for a better world. They ridicule the revolutions and any powerful left-leaning state. 
Victorious and actively militant anti-imperialist governments and nations make them feel irrelevant, obsolete, embarrassing. 
And the Empire knows it. It understands. It uses the soft Western left against the arch socialist and Communist enemies. 
It is using soft left effectively because it is selfish, cowardly and it lacks discipline. But above all, because it is self enamored. 
* 
And so, in great unison with the Western Empire's palace propagandists, the soft Western anti-Communist 'left' is arguing that the governing Left all over the world is not really true left, that the countries that call themselves socialist are in fact more capitalist than the West, and the world can only be saved by some extremely vaguely defined and abstract system of collective production means (unrealistic and utopian, as nowhere except in the West and in a handful of countries inhabited by European descendants, like Argentina, would such concepts be supported by the masses). 
The new alliance is against China, Russia, South Africa, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba, Syria, Iran, Eritrea; it is basically against all countries that are still opting for an independent, anti-imperialist course. 
All these countries are 'wrong'. All of them are brutally 'oppressing their people' and in almost all of them the local 'oligarchs are more brutal than in the West'. 
You look closer, and it's all manipulation and lies, or at best half-truths. However, 'falsehoods repeated a thousand times have a tendency of becoming the truth', as an 'icon' of German Nazism explained many decades ago. And so it goes‚Ä¶ 
Fabrications are sinking deeper and deeper into the sub-conscience of the people, in the West but also in countries that are being targeted. Nobody dares to protest, to scream loudly: 'Nonsense! These countries are actually socialist!' 
What eyes are seeing and what the brains are conditioned to 'conclude' are suddenly two thoroughly different things. 
The strategy of the Western Empire is clear: it makes things thoroughly confused, too complex to understand, lacking in transparency. 
'Capitalist China, right-wing Russia, anti-black South Africa, state-capitalist Venezuela, monolithic and Fascist DPRK. Who would want to follow their examples? Better to accept the familiar Western fundamentalist capitalism and imperialism'. That's what the world is being maneuvered into thinking. 
Brilliant indoctrination strategy! Except‚Ä¶ Red flags, fresh from being washed, are proudly waving all over the world, once again. In China and Russia, in South Africa and in so many other places, people are proudly returning to the old labels. 
Not everyone can understand, anymore, but many are still able too feel, instinctively, and as a result of these basic human impulses, a violent clash between depressing deceit and simple human desires and dreams will soon become imminent.
