41   Russia and Japan haven't been able to settle the issue of the Kuril Islands and sign a peace treaty since the end of World War II, resulting in a territorial dispute that's been around for seven decades. But warm ties between the countries' current leaders could lead to a breakthrough. Many are expecting progress to be made when Russian President Putin is in Japan for a state visit in December. Can the issue of the disputed islands be settled for good? And will Japan's special relationship with America stand in the way of closer cooperation with Russia? Former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama is on SophieCo to discuss. Follow @SophieCo_RT

Divergent 3D showcased its Blade Supercar, the world's first highway-safe, 3D-printed supercar, during a press and dealers' preview ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show on Wednesday. 
The vehicle boasts 700-hp motor, weights 1,400 lbs (635 kg), and is able to reach 0-60 mph in 2.5 seconds, according to manufacturer. Apart from that, Blade has 1/3 the emissions of an electric car and 1/50 the factory capital costs of other manufactured cars. 
Kevin Czinger, CEO of Divergent 3D, says 'this is the first car that's actually a real car that can be taken on a highway that can be safety certified as a fully safe highway car… It's going to be a 21st century revolution in manufacturing.'

For his single minded determination, some say he's a madman, and others, a saint.
