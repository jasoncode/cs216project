Home | World | Corrupt FBI Influencing Elections Corrupt FBI Influencing Elections By Agent Smith 30/10/2016 10:42:53 
NEW YORK '“ USA '“ Timing is everything in an election, and this is proof alone that the FBI has an internal corruption problem as the shady timing of continuing an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email extravaganza suddenly rears its ugly head once again days before the election. 

One can easily fingerprint Trump and his team behind this latest Wiener exposure, however it is the corrupt cronies within the FBI who most certainly are linked to Trump that hold the evidence of their own corruption. 
Sure, you say the whole system is corrupt, however trying to influence the elections in such an underhand way is beyond dirty. 
The agency should have a foresight system wherein they overlook such electoral discrepancies, especially so close to an election. 
Comey, the director of the FBI claims to be an Independent however the evidence presented by his behaviour puts him as a staunch Republican. 
Who knows how much Trump promised him after the election is over, no doubt the reward will be delivered discreetly wrapped carefully in little brown bags. 
Corruption is endemic in all levels of the U.S. government however to see it played out so obviously for everyone to see like this is a sign that no one actually cares any more. The apathy and nonchalance is astonishing. Share on :

Home | Health | Hook Up Sites Tinder and Grindr Good For Population Control Hook Up Sites Tinder and Grindr Good For Population Control By Girolamo Fracastoro 30/10/2016 22:17:24 
LONDON '“ England '“ News that there has been a massive spike in syphilis amongst users of Tinder and Grindr is welcome news to many who are seriously concerned with over population. 

Because syphilis can stay mainly undetected if untreated it can remain latent in the body for years. In the late stages of syphilis, the disease damages the internal organs, including the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones and joints leading to early death. 
Antibiotics are increasingly becoming redundant due to overuse and the WHO has warned of a coming cataclysmic disaster where many ailments are untreatable due to resistance. 
'These people are spreading STIs around like candy and soon their diseases will not be treatable. It works both ways, deaths from syphilis and gonorrhoea will eventually cull these populations thinning the herd,' a clinical insider revealed. 
What about HIV? Unfortunately it has not had the effect in population reduction that was needed. Although it is still prevalent amongst the gay population, it needs to make more in roads into the heterosexual population to become effective in reducing the population numbers. 
Since the discovery of HIV/AIDS it has only killed 36 million, considering the global population is 7.5 billion and growing, it's a drop in the ocean. 
We must therefore encourage more sites like Tinder and Grindr, the more the better. These sites peddle death to the stupid, and less stupid people on earth can only be a very good thing. 
App developers need to make in roads in creating more hookup apps tailored not only for the developed world but for the third world, especially nations like China and India as well as the African continent, where population growth is beyond unsustainable. 
Once STDs like syphilis explode in these regions, which are wholly untreatable, they will continue to spread like wildfire. 
The creators of Tinder and Grindr should be commended for their great works, you have fired the starting gun in the race to reduce the global population before it is too late. Promiscuous risky sexual encounters should be encouraged at all junctures to spread STIs. 
Finite resources are being permanently depleted daily, and it is only a matter of time before the Malthusian nightmare is upon us. Estimated projections for global population growth are 11.2 billion by 2023 according to the UN. 
This cannot be allowed to happen, so please go on Tinder and Grindr now, and do your bit. You can catch chlamydia, genital warts, HIV, syphilis and gonorrhoea, maybe all at the same time. Share on :

Home | World | New Song by Michael Heseltine: 'Who Snuffed the Dogs Out' New Song by Michael Heseltine: 'Who Snuffed the Dogs Out' By Trinny Tatler 01/11/2016 19:28:47 
NORTHAMPTONSHIRE '“ England '“ A song released by former Conservative MP Michael Heseltine aka Tarzan, has shot into the UK charts at number 2. 


Released by the 83 year old former MP's own record label Ungawa Records, the song is simply about strangling his dog. 
'Who snuffed the dogs out? Who snuffed the dogs out? Hezza! Hezza! Hezza!' a sample of some of the lyrics which go on a permanent loop for three and a half minutes include a soundbite from Margaret Thatcher saying 'Get orf my neck!' 
The eighties drum machine sound is very retro, and also the very realistic sound of a gurgling dog in the background while Heseltine conducts an almighty Tarzan wail makes for interesting listening. 
All proceeds of the record will not go to the RSPCA but will instead be funnelled into Heseltine's latest acquisition, a duck house in his large pond, so he can shoot the shit out of the ducks when they're trying to nest. Share on :

Home | World | Britain No Longer a Sovereign Democracy Britain No Longer a Sovereign Democracy By Anzu Legion 03/11/2016 13:41:13 
LONDON '“ England '“ Britain is no longer a sovereign democratic nation when 17.5 million people who voted for Brexit can be swept aside with illegal injunctions. 


When Britain is being ruled by those who wish harm upon these shores from foreign nations, and pander to other nations to invade, then there is no reason to believe that we are living in a democratic sovereign nation. 
This is the case when 17.5 million people voted on June 23 to leave the European Union, only to be overstepped by a few treasonous vipers who misled the High Court possibly due to corruption at the highest levels of the system. 
The EU referendum was a legally bound vote with promises from the political establishment that the result would be respected. 
To have the wrath of 17.5 million people on you will not be a nice thing, it will not be pleasant because the people never forget, and the coming election will result in some major changes. 
We are currently embroiled within a constitutional crisis, where the will of the people is being superseded by a few litigational scum bags who do not realise the enormity of their decision to thwart the will of the people. 
Boycott 
You have condemned all members of parliament who supported Remain to unemployment. You will never be voted in again, including Theresa May who shoehorned herself into the role of prime minister. 
Guyanese Gina Miller, who was instrumental in this decision is not even British, she is some investment banker cunt with no mandate to thwart the EU referendum. 
As for the judges involved, you have no right to undermine the will of the people. It is most certainly a question of corruption at the highest levels where these supposed upholders of law, are working against the law and undermining democracy and Britain's sovereign rights. 
17.5 million people voted for Brexit and 17.5 million people will have their say in 2020 when the right people will be put in charge. 
The people never forget.

LONDON '“ England '“ The High Court decision today is a betrayal of the will of the people cast on June 23 2016 in the EU referendum. 

Britain as a nation is now on the verge of being lost, and all it has worked for for centuries are now but a memory. 
We are now living in a Stasi EU zone with no sovereign rights, we are ordered about by the unelected eurocrats in the EU Commission, and many within parliament are now servants to the European Union. 
Contempt 
This great betrayal of the people who voted in a democratically held EU referendum will not be forgotten, and those who are accountable in parliament to thwart the democratic vote will feel the wrath of the voters when it comes to election time. 
It's Them Against 17.5 Million People Who Voted Brexit 
They will not be elected again, they will be despised and as they are traitorous scum, they shall be left to the dung heap of history, a forgotten note under a morass of festering putrid excrement. 
True Britons never give up, and they will not, they will fight against the duplicitous forces within this nation that seek to commit High Treason against the Crown. 
As much as the ground that has been lost today by the criminal treasonous High Court decision to overstep the voters, there will never be an end to the fight for sovereign status from those who wish the UK to be ruled by the Soviet EU entity. 
No doubt, Brussels has the law courts firmly within their grasp, but the Remain traitors, lickspittle vile treasonous vermin will one day get their comeuppance. 
And in other news, the pound spiked, so we have further proof of who else is behind all of this. Share on :

Home | World | Brexit Lost: Scuppered By May and High Court Brexit Lost: Scuppered By May and High Court By Mr. Charrington 03/11/2016 11:48:44 
LONDON '“ England '“ The High Court decision today to deny the EU Referendum result is a sign that we are not living in a democracy or a sovereign country. 

Today is a very sad day for democracy within the UK, and Theresa May a Remain supporter is instrumental in denying the will of the British people to leave the EU. 
Dithering and Delaying Tactics 
Through numerous delaying tactics , and the installation of key government posts of Remain campaign MPs, the Brexit referendum was thwarted. 
If the government had repealed the 1972 European Communities Act immediately the EU referendum result would be well on the way to materialising. 
The total nonchalance and denial of the EU referendum result is firmly on Theresa May's head and her appointment of Hammond as Chancellor of the Exchequer was a further sign that May was not serious about the EU referendum result. 
Injustice 
The High Court ruling today which is intrusive and false, as well as being undemocratic is a further signal that we are currently not living in a sovereign nation and it is totally controlled by Brussels. 
During the EU Referendum, MPs had their say , MPs campaigned, and when it came to vote in the referendum, they voted. Therefore, parliament has already had a say in the EU referendum, and by going to the High Court, these traitors have sought to annul a democratic vote which was held on June 23 2016. 
This ruling is a shameful reminder that Britain has lost all sovereign status to the EU entity, it is a sad day for democracy, for the will of the people and ultimately for the country. 
17.5 Million People Will Vote on Election Day 
In these circumstances, we must as a people show our displeasure at being circumvented by not voting during the next election for any MP or party who is EU centric. 
This is not over.

Home | World | Markets Do Not Want Trump Markets Do Not Want Trump By Nostro 02/11/2016 10:57:45 
NEW YORK '“ USA '“ If you vote for Trump you vote for a future of serious financial upheaval, poverty, and destitution. 
We can see this in the market reaction to the recent Trump revival after Clinton's FBI charade. 
In all certain terms markets across the globe will continue dropping and if you have any equity in your pension plans, you can kiss that goodbye too. 
Trump will bring heavy inflation to America, and the globe, where prices of consumer goods will sky rocket. With heavy inflation and low salary growth, there will be less money to pay your mortgage, and many will default on their payments. 
Feeding your family will be a hard task, as the supermarkets raise their prices to never before seen levels. How about paying $14 for a loaf of bread or $23 for some rice. 
With the equity markets tanking, the dollar (DXY) will fall to 23 in a matter of days rendering it useless to pay off even a portion of America's vast deficit. China is already dumping their dollar reserves. 
Trump will be forced to cut welfare payments to all dependants citing no cash, but having the welfare bill cut will cause mass rioting amongst those who depend on EBT for food. 
Medical insurance, which is already skyrocketing in price will increase by over 400% when Trump tries to rearrange the insurance industry. This will mean only the very rich, like Trump, will be able to afford health care and the rest of the populace will be left in the dirt. 
Donald Trump is only doing this for his ego, he does not care for the poor. According to Trump the poor should all be mowed down by bulldozers and erased from America. He will only cater for the very rich, not the average American. 
Martial Law 
With extreme poverty, there will be civil unrest leading to civil war as some states will seek to secede from the union. Trump will engage the military to quash any civil unrest, however this will be a catalyst for even more unrest. 
It is for the sake of you and your family that you do not vote for Trump, he will destroy America from the inside out. He will send your sons and daughters to fight in the Middle East when he brings in the military draft. 
There is no going back, once you vote that is it. You will deal yourself and your family a death upon death, a misery so great that you will wish you had not been tricked by his lies, and he is a liar, a business man with many tricks to fool others so he can win through trickery. 
The Daily Squib has accurately predicted many future events and we stand by our word. This is our seal of approval, as we have already proven many accurate prophesies that have come to light many years before the actual event. 
If you want to die, if you want your children dead, if you want your grandchildren dead, then vote for Donald Trump. Share on :

Home | World | Brexit Betrayal: Britain Must Prepare For Thirty Years of Civil Unrest and Riots Brexit Betrayal: Britain Must Prepare For Thirty Years of Civil Unrest and Riots By Dark Waters 04/11/2016 07:53:14 
LONDON '“ England '“ The consequence of diverting the result of a democratically held referendum vote which was given full support from parliament and won by 52% of voters for Brexit will be the undoing of Britain's constitution. 

To simply bypass the peoples vote will not be tolerated by many and there will be civil unrest in the future if Brexit is not delivered. 
Mass rioting and looting in all cities will be the norm, because if there is no rule of law in our democracy, why should the people adhere to any rule of law on the streets? 
In essence, civil unrest is the last bastion of justice, and to have the conclusive EU referendum vote stolen by crooked biased EU centric judges will be their final undoing. 
There will be no peace, as the rioting masses converge burning everything in their path, who is to say what will happen, but when the anger envelopes the populace there is no stopping the torrent. 
It is better to fight for justice than to be timid, civil unrest is a disruptive tool that when utilised correctly can bring forth real change. Change that crooked corrupt judges commandeered by rich business people cannot do. 
Of course violence and looting is a terrible thing, but so is war, so is injustice, but these are necessary measures for survival, if nothing is done soon, Britain and its people will be no more. Already, we have been inundated, but if there is no Brexit, the numbers will increase tenfold, until the tiny island of Britain is nothing more than a holding prison, a junk filled morose, barren overpopulated garbage dump. 
Britain fought two world wars and was on the winning side of both, this time, the Germans will take Britain without a single shot being fired, this is the central position of the EU. The European Union is an East German Soviet construct incorporating German Imperial fascist techniques to subjugate other nations through economic means. 
By bribing the corrupt judges who are linked to EU centric projects, the EU is seeking to halt Brexit. 
No More 
Are you a fucking fool to take that? Are you going to stand by and let your nation be taken over? Or are you going to fucking stand up and fucking do something about it? 
We must do what is necessary.

Home | World | Experts: Britain's National Security at Stake Infiltrated by EU Experts: Britain's National Security at Stake Infiltrated by EU By Guy Fawkes 05/11/2016 11:17:32 
Corruptio optimi pessima est 
LONDON '“ England '“ The High Court decision to quash Brexit is proof that there are clandestine operatives within the system who only hold allegiance to Brussels and not to the United Kingdom. 


Only a purge of the political, judicial, and defence sectors can save Britain from the mass infiltration of EU operatives working within the British governmental institutions. 
These people have been identified during the EU referendum and must be purged from the system otherwise these treasonous operatives of the EU could cause further harm to the British constitution and Britain's national security. 
We have seen the damage already committed within the judicial system when EU operative judges were allowed to preside over the Brexit ruling and attempted to thwart the vote of the electorate on the EU referendum. 
The blatantly biased decision by these EU judges, one of which is Lord Carnwath, 71, who was one of four co-founders of the EU Forum of Judges for the Environment and served as the forum's secretary general from 2004-05. The body exists to 'promote the enforcement of national, European and international environmental law'. 
L ord Reed, began his career as an advisor to the Scottish education department, served as a judge in the European Court of Human Rights, who also acted as an expert adviser to the European Union Initiative with Turkey on Democratisation and Human Rights between 2002 and 2004, and the following year he became chairman of the Franco-British Judicial Co-operation Committee. 
The other EU judge is Lord Kerr, 68, who also sat as a judge in the European Court of Human Rights, ruling on a case in 2001 involving aircraft noise from Heathrow. 
Additionally we have L ord Mance, 73, who began his career working for a law firm in Hamburg, before qualifying as a barrister in 1965. His time in Germany gave him a taste for international legal affairs, and he has represented the UK on the Council of Europe's Consultative Council of European Judges, which was set up in 2000 to advise the Council of Europe on the 'independence, impartiality and competence' of judges. He has also served as a member of a seven-person EU panel that helps select judges and advocates-general of the European Court of Justice and General Court. 
These elements within the panel were clearly not impartial in their decision purely on their heavily entrenched links with the EU. 
Impartiality within law regarding key national security decisions like Brexit should be paramount to the judicial system within Britain therefore in justice terms, their decision to thwart Brexit, and the EU referendum result, voted for by 52% of the electorate, is wholly unjust and biased, bordering on corruption at the highest levels. 
The question of corruption should be implemented with a full public inquiry into how these judges were selected and how they were allowed to come to their obviously biased non impartial decision. We must as a democracy look into any form of clandestine payments given to the judges prior to their decision, and if any discrepancy is found it must be put right. 
Britain's national sovereignty is at stake, and treachery, corruption at the highest judicial levels must be eradicated to conserve our constitution. To purge the institutions of EU collaborators and clandestine operatives should be of paramount import in order to solidify Britain's national security and overall sovereign status. Share on :

Home | World | The Real EU Referendum Will Be the Next General Election The Real EU Referendum Will Be the Next General Election By Finbar Bounder 03/11/2016 17:45:54 
LONDON '“ England '“ The real referendum will be the next general election when the people who voted for Brexit (52% of the electorate) will make their voices heard once again. 

The multiple scenarios and variables are too many to discuss in one article, however it is fair to say that any MP who is a Remainer will not be in office after the election. 
With this in mind, the currently unelected PM, Theresa May, will most certainly lose her position chiefly because of her dilly dallying regarding the Brexit process and her choice in putting key Remain MPs in high government positions and Brexit committees which undermined everything. 
Because of the unjust corrupt court ruling today conducted by biased judges , there are calls for a general election to be held before 2020. 
If this happens, there will be a bloodbath at the polling booths however under the current circumstances, if a general election occurs in 2020, there will still be a bloodbath. 
It does not matter when the next election is held, there will be a bloodbath of Remain MPs. Your days of parliament are numbered, so count them well. 
It is probably in Theresa May's interest to never hold a general election in Britain ever again. Certainly, this choice will suit the undemocratic Remain contingent, such is their allegiance to the undemocratic EU. Share on :

Who do you think you're kidding Mr. Juncker? 
LONDON '“ England '“ When it comes to low information voters who do not have much knowledge of what they are voting for, or the EU, Remain voters and supporters fit the bill very succinctly. 

These Remain people are more concerned about roaming charges on their mobile phones in the continent than any serious issues that the EU is forcing on Britain. 
Brainwashed Remain voters are easily led sheep who would willingly go over a cliff because of their entrenched EU programming and their devout hatred of Britain. 
Jean Claude Juncker's EU army is already on a roll, and the Remain supporters are unknowingly bringing forth this fascistic monster into plain sight. 
Not only is an EU army a threat to NATO but is seen as a direct threat by Russia right on their doorstep. 
By staying in the EU, the UK's armed forces would be forced to cede control to a Brussels high command. 
The EU army already has an advanced control structure developed and is ready to go to the next level where all EU nations would be forced to commit their armed forces under a single EU military force. 
So when your sons and daughters are called up to have their limbs blown off on the battlefield, you can stop your Remoaning '” you fully supported remaining in the EU. Share on :

WASHINGTON D.C. '“ USA '“ The nightmare is nearly over, the 2016 U.S. election will finally be laid to rest today when American voters vote in the first female president of the USA. 

Gladly we don't live in the goldfish bowl of America where the constant news reportage has been beating down on the heads of Americans every second of the day with propaganda and ridiculous campaign advertising. One only has to look at the crowds of brainwashed citizens in stadiums waving their flags to see they are not all there, their eyes exhibit the same hypnotised ten thousand yard stare, their shrieks of support for whichever candidate a call to arms for other fellow lemmings to join their crusade. 
The decision for Hillary Clinton was set over a year ago, and the Daily Squib accurately predicted the final result.

LONDON '“ England '“ Anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller has been revelling in her new found fame by posing outside the Houses of Parliament. 


'I used to be a model you know,' Miller says every two minutes. 
She seems to be enjoying the limelight and fame of being one of the foreign interests who was instrumental in attempting to block 52% of British voters who voted to leave the EU. 
Posing in defiance, Ms Miller, a native of Guyana, brings out her new hat, acquired at some posh shop no doubt, or a betting shop lavatory to be more precise. 
'Do you like my new hat?' she scowls, as the primping begins in earnest. 
The photographer adjusts his lens, then sniffs loudly. 
'S'cuse me Miss, but what's that awful smell? It smells like a turd that has festered in satan's butt hole for a thousand years.' 
'It's my hat, or shall I say crown. I shall wear it wherever I go from now on, and anyone who looks at me will see my beautiful crown that I wear so proudly, and think of me.' 
At that moment, four dozen bluebottle flies plop themselves on Gina Miller's crown and tuck down to some good nosh. 
In the background, the spire of Big Ben looms over the scene, and as the coughing photographer clicks away, a wry smile comes over Gina Miller, she is the Queen today, the Queen of No-Brexit, and she will cherish this moment of fame for the fifteen minutes it will afford her. 
Enjoy your crown Gina Miller, you will wear it for the rest of your pitiful life.

  has won the presidency and he will now bide his time in making his agenda known. 


As the safe zones crack, the microaggressions rack, and the SJWs whack, there is great fear in America today. 
For eight long tortuous years we have been witness to the incessant moaning of the leftist socialist contingent and their wishes to curtail free speech, to force their doctrines into peoples' mouths, to promote their socialist utopian mirage that never happened upon the populace. 
As the Obama doctrine, a stout hatred of the British, a devout homosexual agenda and a consummate Marxist ideology were splattered onto every American orifice and fucked with lube, ends, it ends in shame, acrimony and the indignity of being erased completely from history without any recognition. 
Donald Trump will dismantle Obamacare, he will take down all these socialist executive actions, he will completely remove any evidence that Obama was ever president. There will be no trace of Obama in four years of Trump presidency left, and his legacy will be zero, just a grain of sand in an ocean of time. 
As for the global community, there will be a trade war with China now. The Chinese have for too long taken the U.S. for granted, and their time of selling Yanks cheap plastic trinkets that break after one day are over. Anything made in China is of the worst quality, and is immediately viewed as dispensable. 
The South Americans streaming over the borders will no longer be tolerated and encouraged, as much as the Democrats utilised these people as fodder for votes, those days are long gone. Look where it got Hillary? 
Mexico will be taxed to hell, and the illegals shipped to the border and thrown into the desert. Walk back to Mexico where you came from you dirty slickback they will say. 
If the blacks riot again, they will this time get a proper response, not the Obama response that was so prevalent during his tenure. There will be live ammo used on the blacks to put them firmly in their place. 
Anyone who says Trump is not establishment is wrong, he was not only born into the establishment but the people he knows are all establishment. One must remember that the establishment controls both sides of any argument, and whoever wins is always the establishment. 
When Trump met Kissinger, that was a clue that there was movement in his campaign, and this meeting alone should have signalled a change in sentiment amongst the controllers. 
The rhetoric used in Trump's acceptance speech was far removed from the braggadocio and fascism of his former speeches, this is because Trump can now bide his time, he will cut down the Muslims in his own time, he will make his mark on Saudi Arabia, and Iran, in his own time, that will come. If you are a devout Muslim in America and dress like one, you will be targeted soon, so it is in your best interests to either assimilate into the American ways of dress and habits or to leave. You will be targeted in the streets, and you will be hounded out of town. This is why you must leave now, or later on find yourself in a camp, similar to how the Japanese were treated in World War two. 
A great war is coming, and even though Putin and Trump may seem chummy now, there is one thing you must never do, and that is trust a Russian. It is an impossible feat in itself, because how can you trust something that moves from one side to the other so quickly? 
We must prepare, and we must look to places of safety far away from any civilisation or U.S. interests to find that safety as the war will be long and vicious, possibly nuclear. 
Kudos to Trump for winning, but where he touched Americans with his emotive rhetoric he has left a warning of the future, for without constraint and patience, there will be global war soon, and this is firmly within the establishment's agenda. 
Let the Purge begin.

  can thank eight years of Obama rule, which has most certainly lost Hillary Clinton the U.S. election. 


Socialists in America have had their day, all the Marxists and Communists within the Democrat party have torn the country apart. 
Eight long burdensome years of Obama, overspending on socialist pet projects, controlling, politically correct, gays, feminists, transexuals, inhibiting free speech, encouraging global chaos and people have had enough. 
One can only hope that Black Lives Matter is buried under deep concrete never to be seen again, all the SJWs are taken out into the streets and beaten with bats, and the politically correct morons are told to shut the fuck up once and for all. 
The silent Americans seething for eight long years fought back, and to vote for someone like Trump was a breath of fresh air even though in an act of defiance against the whole system of corruption. 
As one maverick to another, there can only be an element of respect given to Trump, who just did not give a fuck, and has in one night buried eight years of hell under Obama, possibly the worst president of the United States ever encountered. 
It has to be said that eight years of blackness has ended, and we can all breathe a breath of fresh air and light, albeit with major uncertainties. 
Under Trump there will be war with China, there will be economic hell, and there will be upheaval but anything is better than more Obama or socialists.

Home | World | Trump Reveals American Muslim Solution Trump Reveals American Muslim Solution By Michael Ainsworth 10/11/2016 21:21:28 
Many U.S. Muslims prefer Sharia law 
WASHINGTON D.C. '“ USA '“ President elect, Donald Trump has today made his plans for Muslims in America known to reporters. 

Donald Trump visited the White House today to meet with outgoing president Barack Hussein Obama on plans for the transference of power. To say the meeting was edgy and cold would be an understatement. 
Trump's landslide victory at the recent U.S. elections caught many off guard, and liberals are all still in deep shock that their delegate Hillary Clinton was not elected. 
After the meeting at the White House, when asked about Muslims, Trump was at first hesitant about revealing his plans, but then answered emphatically that Muslims are a danger to the national security of the nation. 
No Sharia 
'I have already spoken in depth about Muslims. Our solution will be humane and just. Their religion is abhorrent and cannot be trusted. We cannot trust Muslims in our cities, our streets, our jobs. Look what happened in the San Bernardino shooting or the Orlando massacre? These atrocities were all committed by Muslims on U.S. citizens going about their daily lives. We can't have this savagery amongst us. That's why I'm calling for every Muslim to be registered in a database. We need to find out who the devout ones are, who the others are. We need to know if they own guns, and we need to stop their permits. We need to know and watch every Muslim in this country, and when the time comes I will make the final decision. We need to detain them until all the attacks stop. Detain or deport. We'll give them a choice. Let's not forget their mosques either, shut them down, we can and will do that. They have no place in America, a Christian God loving country.' 
Another reporter asked about Muslims who wish to visit the United States. 
'It's common sense. We have no choice. There is already a no-fly list in place for known terrorists and criminals. Our policy in the name of Homeland Security will be that all Muslims are potential terrorists. Until the war of terror is over, this will be our policy. They can go and visit some other country, but Muslims will not be welcome in America while I am president.' 
As reporters rushed to ask further questions, Trump halted them and moved on with his entourage. 
There are fears for many Muslims in America today, as attacks on their person have risen by 25% already since Trump's election victory. Many are now making plans to leave of their own volition. Share on :

Home | World | Rubber Band Politics: How the Left Enables the Right Rubber Band Politics: How the Left Enables the Right By Baron Von Schlitz 13/11/2016 11:32:09 
WASHINGTON D.C. '“ USA '“ The rise if the right is a direct result of the left, as the rubber band is pulled so far, it must eventually snap back. 


Pull a rubber band to its very limit, and it eventually snaps back. 
The government of America went too far to the left, the socialist pseudo Marxist strains of Obama thus enabled Trump's win. No one could tolerate another four years of socialism especially under a ball breaker staunch feminist like Hillary Clinton. 
The natural state of human existence is a moderate conservative attitude, one of family and of conserving traditional values, the socialists wish to destroy the family, to destroy culture through mass migration at speed, to effectively destroy all traditions and norms as much as possible. 
This is why we are seeing a mass movement now to the right, people are fed up of the homosexualisation of everything, of the bending of all tradition, the PC, the emasculation of the male, and the dominance of transexualisation, the forcing of cultural racial integration. 
President Obama wanted the U.S. military to become a bath house full of homos and transsexuals, which in effect emasculated the army. Soldiers cowering behind walls more worried about their nails or make up, whilst real soldiers came over the top with their Russian grimaces, eager to bury their bayonets deep into the homosexualised American ninnies, trembling with fear, and pissing in their knickers. 
People want armies that can fight effectively, they don't want Obama's faggot army, they want real men who can do the job, and do not need to be mollycoddled at every turn. 
By pulling the rubber band so far, Obama and his ilk is responsible for bringing forth the right, they shamelessly were instrumental in the resurgence of the extreme right wing, as it moves to rebalance the vast move to the left. 
In Europe we are now seeing the cowering socialists doomed to years of purgatory, as the people rise up and remove them from office. Feminism has had its day as it is consigned to the dustbin, to be retrieved eventually when people have had enough of the right. 
This sort of rubber band politics, is one of extremes, pull, snap, pull, snap, and on it goes. People do not necessarily vote for the best candidate but simply because they've had enough of a certain regime or political ideology that has been prevalent for a long time. 
Yes, there is a sense of relief when the politically correct socialists are given the boot, because you can say what you want again, it is a real relief. Socialists claim to be progressives, however they inhibit free speech, how is this progress? The right on the other hand allow things to be said, but this in turn can in the future be taken to the extreme as well, as we have seen throughout history. 
One faction enables the other and work as a well oiled machine, and this is the mechanism that moves agendas quickly for the Controllers, who of course deal on both sides at the same time. Whichever side wins, they always win, and many voters are of course blind to such things. This is good, the voters must be ignorant to the fact that they are mere pawns in a bigger game. 
The core infrastructure does not give a flying fuck who wins an election, could be red, blue or yellow, they simply give instructions to the victor and the deal is done. How many times have you seen a government come in to power, and adopt the rulings of the previous government. We see this in Britain, where Labour increased CCTV surveillance by the million, then the Conservatives came into power, instead of reducing surveillance, they carried on with it, and adopted it fully, despite bad mouthing it when they were in opposition. 
Europeans of the right will bring racial intolerance, which is a natural human emotion and a reaction to the invasive qualities of sudden mass migration. Where the boulevards of Paris once were adorned with cafes, and sojourning Parisians, they are now replete with Africans on messy mattresses and tents, the once beautiful pavements adorned not with Art Deco lampposts but excrement and piss. This migrant influx is a direct result of the laissez faire attitude of the EU socialist elite who turned a blind eye to their utopian Schengen dream which turned out to be a road from the world's poverty stricken zones to the West. 
Leftists should prepare themselves to an approximate thirty or forty years in the wilderness, and they have only themselves to blame. It is obviously impossible for leftists to be moderate, and this is their own undoing. Yes, but you say, what about Blair and Cameron? Well, these were socialists with a centrist marginal conservative attitude, especially when it came to finance. Their sole purpose was economical staying-in power politics and nothing else. 
Donald Trump, and Farage are a movement, and France will be the next focus. Once France is repatriated from the socialists, Germany will once again regain it's pride in the Fatherland. Italy will follow as will the rest of the European nations. Schengen will be scrapped, as it is the road to self-destruction, and people hold a natural will to survive and not to die. 
The right is the correct way for human national survival, the socialist does not care for national survival, family or traditional human values, it seeks to destroy all of these in as fast a time as possible. Socialists seek to subvert human existence into a perverted bastardised form of malevolence they call progress. Human societal and political progress must be allowed to slowly evolve and not be pushed by socialist control freakery. 
Whether you are left or right of the political spectrum, in the end does not matter of course. These are all created constructs to keep the machine moving. Having elections every four years prevents civil unrest and rioting. That is the only reason for the so-called democracies that the West claims rule the globe. 
We all live in a democracy where if you go out into the street to protest, the militarised police will beat your teeth into the gutter with their truncheons and trample over you with their boots. 
Without one there can be no other, the left needs the right and so forth, to play off each other. Without sickness, the doctor would be out of a job, and without crime, the policeman would be unemployed.

Home | World | Ignore Farage at Your Own Peril Ignore Farage at Your Own Peril By Roo Lette 14/11/2016 12:26:58 
NEW YORK '“ USA '“ Lambasted and much maligned by the existing political classes, Nigel Farage, is the reason the UK won its Brexit ruling. Without his vision and his following Britain would have been denied the all important referendum. 

Nigel Farage is also chums with Donald Trump, much to the dismay of May, who probably detests both characters, but she is going to have to put her little patterned shoes to the side for a minute and speak to the two men. 
The lads are fighting back it seems, and good ol' Boris has confirmed that Trump will be good for Brexit, and any confirmation from BoJo is as good as any. 
This is why it is crucial to end any acrimony towards Farage and Trump, and get on with making some serious money, trade deals between the U.S. are now front of the queue, whereas the EU is now firmly in bottom place. 
How the tables have turned in just a few weeks is absolutely amazing. The EU is firmly on the backfoot with little or no cards to play. Their protectionist racket crumbling before their own eyes. Who knows what happened to that Canada deal? Snuffed out like a cigar into Juncker's cognac glass, a now distant memory to the Canadians, who are really sick of dealing with the procrastinating idiots in Brussels. 
In Theresa May terms, Farage must be the go-between between her and Trump, because due to her conduct in the exit proceedings, May has dithered, she has taken a long time and all the while the Remoaners have been allowed to scheme their little schemes. Because of her dithering we now have this High Court case stitch-up and various other nefarious schemes to put a halt to Brexit. Can May be trusted? No, is the short answer, and until there is full movement on the Brexit front, everything she says should be taken with a pinch of salt. Share on :

Home | Sci/Tech | When They Switch the Chip On You Won't Know Who You Are Anymore When They Switch the Chip On You Won't Know Who You Are Anymore By Dr. Kane Targonen 15/11/2016 18:20:20 
LOS ALAMOS '“ USA '“ The immersive qualities of Virtual Reality are only just being rolled out right now, but in a few years every household will have multiple head sets, eventually progressing to mind chips. 

People who have these VR sets are already completely addicted to the sensation of total immersion within another world, and this is the clincher, soon they will not be able to live without their VR headsets. 
The natural progression from an external device, like a pair of goggles is to have a chip implanted into the brain directly which will link up with the synapses and billions of dendrites. These chips are already in use for the severely disabled, however their development is accelerating daily. 
Mapping out every channel and synapse in the human brain is a feat in itself, and they have already mapped out the brains of rodents and smaller creatures. 
'We can upload any scenario directly into your brain, you will feel as if you are there, you will see, smell, and feel every nuance the programmers introduce into the world, you will taste food, you will feel the wind on your cheek, every sensation you feel in the real world can be replicated in the brain directly through the zones activated by the neural implants. 
'This technology will be sold through the premise of perfect memory and data recall. Imagine going to a dinner party and knowing who the head honchos are to schmooze with immediate data downloaded into your brain, imagine being able to speak in any language at the drop of a hat, or recall any text ever written by man at the blink of an eye,' a scientist on the project revealed. 
The next step will no doubt be a jump from the intrusive machinery strapped on to our bodies to the discreet internal implants, and of course with every leap forwards there is always a leap backwards in freedom. You will essentially allow an external force into your own mind. 
Behaviour modification 
'We have apps now for everything, and in the future, you want to fly that Huey, just download the app in thirty seconds and you will be an expert pilot. Yes, it sounds very Matrix, but consider the fact that every six months, the power of computers doubles. We are getting very close now to a point of no return, and the processing power in chips is getting more powerful, yet shrinking in size. We will be able to alter every facet of someone's behaviour. After the chipping process, you will not be recognisable. 
'This is not one way traffic, and advertisers will be able to beam adverts directly into your brain. If you do not comply with whichever regime or government is in charge, they can not only shut you down, but implant nightmares into your own brain to torture you for your crimes. We can see prisoners in jail, who will be put into states of mind torture lasting thousands of years , this is accomplished by speeding their mind clock to the desired level. Prisoners could therefore spend thousands of years breaking rocks with no end in sight, all in their own minds,' the scientist added. 
Once they're in your head, that's it. 
The future will certainly be an interesting place but with the introduction of artificial intelligent systems, sentient machinery and brainchipping, there may be no place for humans to go other than the augmented fashion. Employers will require their staff to be chipped, and all transactions will require biometric approval. Therefore, if you wish to be employed, and eat, you need the chip. Share on :

Home | World | Trump Invigorates New American Volk by Formulating U.S. Einsatzgruppen Trump Invigorates New American Volk by Formulating U.S. Einsatzgruppen By Hermann Drumpf 17/11/2016 16:50:53 
WASHINGTON D.C. '“ USA '“ America is dawning on a new era, a new volksgemeinschaft as proposed by its charismatic leader Donald Trump, a man with deep Germanic roots, and a vision that brings forth strength through Aryan supremacy. 


Already the troops and militia have been designated zones specific to their skills, and the plans to move forward in purging the swamp that is America today, will be conducted with great haste and urgency. 
Having pulled off a great feat through a general election, the Trump movement has followed a legitimate legal path to power, and have not utilised the violence of previous fascist movements to gain power. 
'We had to gain power through the legal American constitution, and once in power we will need to unite the American people under a singular cause. As much of a Pearl Harbor event, a 911, or Reichstag fire on 27 February 1933, this event we are waiting for will be cataclysmic and a profound unitary force amongst the population,' a Trump adjutant, revealed on Thursday. 
Unity in the American people is key, as there are many elements within the populace who do not wish for Trump and his movement to be in power. There will be a purge of the system immediately after inauguration, and all negative elements will be flushed away back into the sewer. 
The Bolsheviks within American politics and society have been routed in the general election, however there are many elements still at hand, lest we forget the Marxist socialist swine Soros and his cohorts of troublemakers. This is why Trump is mobilising the Einsatzgruppen to counteract this threat and to neutralise it once and for all. 
As in every fascist movement, there always has to be a common enemy, and these are primarily Muslims, who are now the new Jews, and after many years of media incitement and hatred sanctioned by governments worldwide, as well as engineered atrocities in the name of that religion carried out by black operation sanctioned Jihadists, the Trump movement has a very explosive adversary. 
Illegal immigrants, are also to be designated as Untermenschen, and designated a common enemy to the American people. 
In accordance with the American constitution, the new president will adhere to the constitution by amending it for his needs. This change will be necessary for the survival of the American Aryan cause, and will be administered as a new improved constitution, a new American Reich for the next thousand years. Share on :

Home | World | Experts: Obama Helped Trump With Illegal Database Experts: Obama Helped Trump With Illegal Database By Carlos MohÃ³n 15/11/2016 09:43:43 
ARIZONA '“ USA '“ As the Obama administration encouraged illegal immigrants to come over the border, Donald Trump wants to stop this, and send them back. 

Thanks to Obama's initiative to acquire a database of illegal immigrants in America, and a pledge of amnesty , which allowed many to sign up, Donald Trump now has a complete list of people to be deported from America. 
Every year many people try to gain entry into the United States utilising legal channels of entry, and millions are denied. It is therefore wrong that many others who wish to come to America can just walk across a border, and were encouraged to do so under the Obama administration. 
Trump has already outlined a plan to deport 2-3 million illegals who arrived illegally from South American countries and who pose a serious danger to the populace. The deportation of illegals with criminal records and links to gangs will be a first step, however there are still approximately 12 million known illegal aliens residing within the U.S.'s border, and these will be rounded up and deported in the next year or so. 
The logistics of rounding up these people and putting them on secure buses back to the border will be enormous. Some advisers are saying that there will be elements who try and flee from immigration control officers, however, they will have no place to go. They will not be able to work, or rent out a place to sleep, once they are caught they too will be rounded up and thrown out of the country. 
Many illegal immigrants are now going underground or fleeing back across the border, so Trump has a big job in front of him, that is if he does not go back on his word. Share on :

Solitudinem fecerunt, pacem appelunt 
LONDON '“ England '“ Whenever extreme leftists lose an election, there are many prices to be paid as the vindictive sore losers create a maelstrom on the way out. 

Socialists do not believe in fair play, and they destroy as much as they can whilst they are in the last days of power. 
This scorched earth policy was witnessed in the last days of the Gordon Brown prime ministership in which he succeeded in burning the UK's economy bringing it to the very brink of extension. 
As for referendums and other votes by the people, these are not honoured by socialists unless the results go their way. We can see what is happening today with the EU referendum, a vote that was conclusively for Brexit by 17.5 million people, 52% of the electorate. The vicious bad sportsmanship of socialists and Marxists are being witnessed now with illegal judicial trickery and they are doing everything in their power to derail the decision. 
There is no such thing as fair play or honour when it comes to these devout socialists who employ every dirty trick in their arsenal to back stab, renege on previous promises or legitimate democratic votes. 
They are not men of honour, they instead utilise nasty underhand cowardly techniques to destabilise and engender a scorched earth policy, all the while, whining and moaning with a collective droning sound. 
So, the next two months will be another example of nasty socialism that has lost, another example of how socialists use their power to punish those who voted against them. These disgusting, vile creatures will do everything now to get you, the populace who had enough of their control freakery, their underhand techniques, and their never ceasing effort to halt freedom of speech, freedom of expression and general human freedom. 
Only stunted morons of the lowest intelligence cannot distinguish satire from fake news, but these are people without any sense of justice, or literary knowledge, they do not care as long as their agenda punishes those who fight for freedom. bono vinci satius est quam almo more iniuriam vincere A good man would rather suffer defeat than defeat another by foul means (Sallust) 
The Daily Squib says to these uncouth vagabonds, these lowly turgid vipers splattering their poisonous inhibitive wares of excrement onto the halls of true satire, an indominitable force, which has survived for thousands of years '” you are nothing. 
You will be left with nothing, for you are inconsequential, you are irrelevant, you will not be remembered, you will be forgotten in the sands of time, lesser than excrement, or turds that align your ideology of dishonour and hatred for purity. 
You will perish without having achieved anything, without even a speck of true creativity or reason, you will be erased from the universe, imploded, and fucked for eternity, for your ill-will, your duplicitous lies will follow you into the deepest depths of the hatred you have created. 
A profound Fuck You follows you to your graves, and may history erase your awful memory forever a stain on the collective conscience of humanity.

Home | World | Taxpayer Funded Peer Lord Kerr Calls Taxpayers 'Stupid' Taxpayer Funded Peer Lord Kerr Calls Taxpayers 'Stupid' By Nema Tocera 18/11/2016 11:12:15 
LONDON '“ England '“ Treachery comes in many forms, and the insipid vile traitor, Lord Kerr, is a stain on everything that is British. 


By calling the British people 'stupid' he in fact reveals himself to be an unintelligent pustule of treasonous puss seeping through the veins of the unelected House of Lords. 
The Europhile peer has claimed Britain needs intelligent migrants to come to the UK because 'native' Britons are 'so bloody stupid'. 
Here is a man who has benefited highly from British taxpayers, who have serviced his chauffeur driven limousines, his first class flights, his mansions, and privately educated his children, calling the people 'stupid'. 
Maybe the taxpayer has been stupid to finance this maggot of a human, a contemptuous traitor willing to sell Britain off to the lowest bidder. 
As for the intelligent migrants he speaks of, yes there are a few, but the majority are now selling copies of the Big Issue outside your local train station, or receiving vast amounts of state subsidies, burdening the NHS, and overcrowding the schools. Something Lord Maggot Kerr would not know about since he lives in his taxpayer funded mansions replete with duck houses and luxury. 
What he does not understand is that the premise of Brexit is not to halt migration completely but to control it. We are not against controlled migration, we are against unfettered uncontrolled migration. 
If there ever were a time to bury these cockroaches infesting the House of Lords, now would be a good time to begin. Share on :

ORLÃ‰ANS, '“ France '“ Like a Phoenix from the flames, soon France may find liberty and freedom again from the stifling octopus grip of the socialists and EU unelected swine. 


Au revoir Sarko, you have had your day. Marine Le Pen is sweeping to the helm of the right wing candidates and Fillon will be swept aside too in the upcoming French election in May, 2017. 
To be set free from the shackles of euro slavery, and for her economy to shoot up into the outer reaches of space, can the French maiden let loose from the darkness and reach her hand into the light to free France once and for all? 
Could this be another Trump/Brexit moment at the polls? 
The EU and its ludicrous Schengen policy has stifled France, muffled her voice and condemned her to the wild tax mad ramblings of the clinically insane Francois Hollande '” a puerile man whose idea of economic embellishment is to categorically destroy everything with socialistic punitive taxes and burdensome mass unfettered migration. 
Can the rising Joan of Arc save France from being marginalised forever? The French are understandably fed up with the EU communist entity and will do or vote for a saviour from the filthy dank EU prison. The boulevards of Paris may once again be something to be proud of, instead of a stinking piss filled camp of degradation. 
The Bastille gates will be breached and the EU technicians taken to the guillotine for some swift justice. 
Vive La France, they will shout as the heads roll into the baskets, these bringers of EU monstrosities onto a land that once coined the phrase LibertÃ©, Ã©galitÃ©, fraternitÃ©, only to be given Contraite, inÃ©galitÃ©, haine. Share on :

alt-right conference in Washington, D.C., where Trump's victory was met with cheers and Nazi salutes 
WASHINGTON D.C. '“ USA '“ During Trump's rise to power as the next president of the United States, he said what the fascist alt-right wanted to hear, then once in power, he disavowed them. 


Trump quite cleverly used the alt-right chump votes to gain power, but now that he is on the cusp of becoming president, Trump is dumping his voters for a more diplomatic stance in rhetoric. 
So, why did you do it? Quite simply, the alt-right, is a white supremacist fascist movement , and even though Trump may still hold fascistic viewpoints, his advisers have probably told him that he needs to tone down his nasty words a little. 
Chumps 
The alt-right vote was a surefire winner for Trump, purely because the followers would be guaranteed to vote for Trump, they are fanatical in their cause, and were fooled very easily into voting for Trump. 
As much as Trump courted the Ku Klux Klan, and other white supremacist Christian groups during his campaign he knew one thing that Hillary did not, and that is these are the silent ostracised groups within America who are guaranteed to vote for something other than an all inclusive democrat. 
There are many now within the alt-right fascist movement who feel angered about being used by Trump, but that's chumps for you, Trump was the player business man who used these easily acquiesced pawns, then dumped the dumb suckers. 
Now that he got their vote, he is quietly disavowing them, and moving towards a more temperate pasture of vocal rhetoric. Share on :

Home | World | Experts: ISIS is Root of True Islam and Cannot be Defeated by Guns Alone Experts: ISIS is Root of True Islam and Cannot be Defeated by Guns Alone By Donnie Patton 23/11/2016 10:35:41 
LONDON '“ England '“ The Global War Analysis think tank summarises the futility of trying to fight an ideology or belief system like ISIS with weapons and military force. 


The Sunni Muslims were the first, then came the Shiites who bastardised the Islamic religion to their own dastardly vision. 
ISIS is the root of the current war raging in the Middle East between Sunnis and Shiites, and as much as the Shia faction is supported by Russia and Iran, the Sunni original interpretation of Islam is the dominant one. 
You can destroy buildings, bomb people, but you can't destroy an ideology, an idea or a belief with military weaponry. You would simply be shooting into thin air. 
This is the fundamental mistake of any military campaign to 'destroy' ISIS, and any military action would ultimately fail, as the numbers of followers are too great. You can wipe out a thousand people, when two thousand will take their place, and so on. 
Regarding the actions of ISIS, these are seen by the West as atrocities, however, they have very cleverly masked their own atrocities committed in the name of Christianity in the past, which would far surpass any ISIS demonstration of violence. 
Let us also consider the fact that any ISIS member views what is permissible in the West as ultimately satanic, they live pious puritanical religious lives, but the satanic Westerner does not, instead he indulges in adultery, homosexuality, alcohol, drugs, pornography, gambling, debt and many other vices. To most Muslims these are seen as Haram, forbidden, and every facet of Western culture holds a permissive attitude to these vices. Therefore, to look through the eyes of these Muslims, what they are fighting against is a great impurity, a great sin against humanity. In their eyes, beheading or burning alive someone who indulges in these activities is almost a cleansing of the earth. Remember that Islam as a religion is almost 400 years behind Christianity in development as a semi-organised religion and the Christians have already passed through the beheading phase. 
This is why they commit these acts of extreme violence, because they are indoctrinated from birth to be pure, and to fight against impurity, which is what the West is defined as in Islam, an impure satanic entity. 
One could also argue that a clinical strike from 30,000 feet by a drone removes the nastiness of close up killing, and you would be right in your assumption, however at ground level where the bombed Muslims reside, they see first hand the damage these clinical strikes create. To them, it is all too real, the mangled bodies, charred beyond belief, and remains of those bombed. Yet, the Western operators of these drones simply see a puff of smoke, an explosion, then move clinically onto the next target. Is there an intrinsic difference to a clinical strike or a beheading by a sword? Both acts deal death, only the Islamic act is sensationalised on film, and the clinical strike is hidden behind a cloud of smoke and debris. They are both the same acts intrinsically because they take away life, albeit with different techniques. 
Here comes the crux of the problem, and that is how does one defeat ISIS? The only way it can be defeated is for every Sunni Muslim in the world to be slaughtered, and for Saudi Arabia to be completely destroyed. It is a well known fact , that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states fund ISIS, and to defeat them would be a massive task for the West, seeing as they have armed these countries with trillions of dollars of high end weapons. 
Furthermore, we have the silence of Israel. This silence at the atrocities committed against other Muslim factions by ISIS is quite understandable, because Israel does not necessarily see anything wrong with these actions. As far as Israel is concerned there's some Islamic cleansing going on, and as long as ISIS is not knocking on their door, they should be positively encouraged and supported to carry on killing other Muslims. 
Donald Trump the upcoming president of the United States says he will defeat ISIS by joining with Russia in the quest, but they will be proved wrong, as mentioned earlier, you cannot defeat an ideology or belief with guns and missiles. You might as well throw trillions of dollars down a well, because the only way to completely eradicate an ideology and belief system is for complete global cleansing of 90% of the Muslim population. That amounts to approximately 1.5 billion people worldwide. Not only that, once 1.5 billion Sunnis are supposedly eradicated, all copies of the Quran would have to be destroyed as well and completely erased from human consumption, almost amounting to an impossible task in itself. 
Within the realms of the battlefield, ISIS is almost amorphous, they blend into the background, and can move easily. There are elements all over the globe now thanks to Obama's eight year rule of nonchalance, and thanks to the EU's Schengen zone, a corridor for free movement of arms and drugs, many have infiltrated Europe. 
Suffice to say, it is the West's own policies that have created the vacuum for ISIS to flourish in the Middle East and as much as there are budgetary and time constraints on the West, the Muslims have all the time in the world. They in fact wish upon the West to be entrenched in this war for as long as they bleed it dry economically. 
Welcome to the next thousand years, this fight will never end, and maybe that is a good thing for some Western commanders, who depend on the arms trade, and who encourage warfare for defence spending increases. 
You cannot bomb an ideology or belief system. If you think so, you have already lost. Share on :

Home | World | Mexicans Say They Will Build Trump Wall '“ Three Feet High Mexicans Say They Will Build Trump Wall '“ Three Feet High By Eduardo Cojon 22/11/2016 11:46:05 
MEXICO CITY '“ Mexico '“ The Mexican government has agreed to Trump's demands to build a wall along the U.S. border, and will start building as soon as Donald Trump is inaugurated as president in February 2017. 


Speaking from his presidential palace, Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, revealed the Mexican plans to waiting journalists. 
'We have taken up the mantle to build the wall and will foot the cost as well. As agreed, the wall will go along the entire U.S. Mexico border.' 
Unbeknownst to Trump, he did not specify how tall the wall should be, and when he finds out the wall will only be three feet high, he is sure to hit the roof. 
'That is a minor detail we did not reveal to SeÃ±or Trump. The wall will be three feet high but it will fulfil our contract, and there is nothing the Don can do about it. Even an eight year old kid can jump over,' the Mexican president added. 
Trump was not available for immediate comment when contacted.

Home | World | Analyst: Why Turkey Opening Border to Millions Migrants into Europe is a Good Thing Analyst: Why Turkey Opening Border to Millions Migrants into Europe is a Good Thing By Gazi 25/11/2016 11:28:20 
ANKARA '“ Turkey '“ The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday has vowed to throw open Turkey's borders to illegal migrants after the European Parliament voted to back a freeze in membership talks with Ankara, and have reneged on a visa deal that was promised by the EU a few months ago. 
With all these broken promises, Turkey is fully justified in opening the floodgates into Europe once again, where the Schengen zone is an effective unguarded corridor not only for illegal migrants, but drugs, arms and other contraband. 
This mass deluge of human traffic into Europe will be good for the United Kingdom's Brexit stance, as an estimated 5 '“ 10 million migrants will push their way from Turkey directly into the European heartland, causing further unrest and problems for the EU, which has already been inundated with millions of migrants from South East Asia, Syria, and Africa. 
The open border with Greece, all the way up to the Black Sea will once again be open to traffic, and as more millions come, news will spread and even more migrants will make the journey. 
Turkey's stance should be applauded in the destruction of the EU, as there will be limited capacity or enthusiasm for even more migrants. 
The numbers of migrants could easily increase to 20 million or 50 million migrants within a year or so, depending on the efforts of the Turks and their open door policy, as well as the forced reception within EU countries residing in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. 
Most migrants will naturally gravitate towards the leading EU nations of Germany and France, however there could be an increased bottleneck scenario occurring around Calais as some try to reach the UK. 
The Turks must be fully commended in their push for the destruction of the EU, and the increase in sentiment for Brexit, however it is the Schengen zone created by unelected eurocrats which will be their own undoing..a beautiful and just end to the masochistic EU, who engineered their own destruction through their own socialist utopian dreams.
