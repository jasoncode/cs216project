Tom Hayden on the Vietnam War and America's Collective Memory Posted on Oct 26, 2016 
Tom Hayden was a crucial figure in the student activist movements of the 1960s and 1970s, known for participating in anti-war protests and demonstrating for civil rights. Notably, he demonstrated against the Vietnam War and was even arrested for his anti-war efforts. Hayden died on Sunday at the age of 76, but even in the last few years he continued to remind America of the importance of activism. 
In a speech given last year at 'Vietnam: The Power of Protest,” a conference in Washington, D.C., Hayden cited his activist history and urged Americans not to forget the powerful political movements of earlier decades. '[T]he struggle for memory and for history is a living thing,” he told the audience. 'Each generation has to wrestle with the history of what came before, and ask: Whose interest does this history serve? How does it advance a legacy of social movements? How does it deny that legacy?” 
Hayden then began to explain the importance of remembering the widespread political activism of the '60s and '70s. 'We gather here to remember the power that we had at one point, the power of the peace movement, and to challenge the Pentagon now on the battlefield of memory,” he said. He continued: 
There came a generation of career politicians who were afraid of association with the peace movement, who were afraid of being seen as soft, who saw that the inside track was the track of war. Our national forgetting is basically pathological. Our systems—politics, media, culture—are totally out of balance today because of our collective refusal to admit that the Vietnam War was wrong and that the peace movement was right. In the absence—in the absence of an established voice for peace in all the institutions, the neoconservatives will fill the foreign policy vacuum. Am I right? Will it not? Will it not advise both parties? I think, though, that American public opinion has shifted to a much more skeptical state of mind than earlier generations, but the spectrum of American politics and media has not. 
In order to fully unify, Hayden concluded, America must remember its past. Although he noted the many successes of the anti-war and pro-civil rights movements, he argues that activists must accept that they 'all walked away” when the Vietnam War ended. 'We might have been united,” Hayden said, 'but instead, we were relegated to wondering what might have been.”

Hillary Clinton's Private Speech From 2015 Mentioned Palestinian Rights—Until She Actually Gave It   Hillary Clinton delivering a speech at the Saban Forum in 2011. ( Flickr / CC 2.0 ) 
The ' Podesta emails ” being released by WikiLeaks continue to illuminate concealed aspects of Hillary Clinton's policy positions. Recent batches of the emails, originating from the server of Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta, include segments of speeches —and a few full transcripts —made by the Democratic presidential nominee to various organizations behind closed doors. 
The emails and speeches are being dumped almost daily and shine a light on many of Clinton's positions—on the environment, foreign policy, big business, health care and more. An email released Tuesday , however, provides an interesting glimpse into the editing of one of Clinton's many speeches and focuses on a controversial political issue: the U.S. relationship with Israel and Palestine. 
The email 'reveals that an extensive section on Palestinian rights was completely removed from an early draft of the speech” Clinton delivered on Dec. 6, 2015, at the Saban Forum in Washington, reporter Eli Clifton explains : 
Palestinian rights and acknowledgment of their national aspirations are nearly completely lacking from the final version. The speech only made a brief reference to Israeli settlement construction, which Clinton loosely described as a 'damaging action.” It also made only one passing, and indirect, acknowledgement of Palestinian suffering, saying, 'Israeli children have been killed as have Palestinian children.” … 
A Dec. 4, 2015, version of the speech, apparently drafted by Clinton speechwriter Dan [Schwerin], made specific references to Palestinian suffering and right to self-determination. Although holding to the position of the Democratic Party and the Clinton camp that a two-state solution cannot be imposed by outside actors like the United Nations, this earlier version of the speech explicitly mentioned settlement construction as an impediment to the peace process. 
The Saban Forum 'is organized by the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution” and was created and is currently chaired by billionaire Haim Saban, who has a history of pro-Israel policy . Saban is also co-owner of Univision, which recently purchased Gawker Media Group Inc. 
Clifton noted that in another email , Podesta himself suggested a 'cut or rework” to a section of the speech that might 'evoke how people feel about how Israel is treating the Palestinians,” and Clifton added that Podesta described Saban as 'not [being] with [Clinton] if she wasn't totally committed to Israeli security.” 
Podesta was probably referring to this segment of Schwerin's draft, which was notably absent from the version Clinton ultimately delivered to the Saban Forum: 
'Israelis cannot live forever in a state of siege. They must not be condemned to the constant fear that they might be stabbed in the street or attacked on a bus. Generation after generation of parents should not have to send their children off to combat. Israelis deserve security, recognition, and a peaceful, normal life. They deserve to live in a nation defined by its founding ideals—democratic, Jewish, and free. 
'And Palestinians have the right to yearn for the freedom to govern themselves, in peace and dignity. For most Americans, it is hard, if not impossible, to imagine living behind checkpoints and roadblocks. Palestinians should be able to achieve their legitimate aspirations. 
'So as difficult as this will be, all the parties must work to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution and create the conditions for progress by avoiding unilateral or damaging actions, whether on the ground, in settlement construction, or at the United Nations.” 
Neither Clinton, Podesta or Schwerin (who is now Clinton's director of speechwriting ) has commented on the leaked email and speech.

Joint Way Forward Deal Does Not Lead to Peace or Progress for Afghans   Nazifa Alizada Afghans protest in Stockholm against the Joint Way Forward deal with signs that read: 'Do not sell us for money.” (Shahmama and Salsal National Association (SANSA)) 
I was born in Ghazni province of Afghanistan but have no memories of my birthplace. When I was 3, the Taliban took over and forced me and my family to flee the country. I was too little to realize any of this. I still have a blurred image of an old orange bus, a loaf of bread, and rugged, dusty mountains. 
As I grew older, my mother explained that the bus belonged to my father, and we did not attempt to migrate to Iran at first. The Soviet invasion and the Afghan civil war taught people of my village how to protect themselves when crises get heated. The men would move their women and children to the dark, moist undergrounds immediately and make them stay there until the situation calmed down. We were not lucky enough to fit in the underground this time. We passed two days in a mountain—the blurred mountain, in my mind—and hopelessly moved toward Iran. 
My Afghan identity took my precious childhood from me. In Iran, I refrained from playing with other kids since they would mock my Afghan accent. I preferred to stay home to avoid hearing 'Afghani kesafat,” or 'Afghani Ashghal,” literally meaning 'the garbage Afghan,” on the street. 
  
When I turned 7, schools refused to let me attend because I was an undocumented Afghan migrant. I enrolled in a school run by refugees for refugees and did my primary schooling there. But the school lacked human and capital resources to offer classes beyond seventh grade, and an undocumented Afghan refugee could not get any further education. Constant insults, seclusion and deprivation of the right to a quality education were the gifts Iran provided me in my childhood. 
In 2001, upon the fall of the Taliban regime, my family and I returned to Afghanistan. At first glance, Kabul resembled anything but a city. Crumbled walls, broken glass, burned buildings, dusty roads and bullet shells on the streets all were evidence of the war. We did not expect a war-weary city to be any better. Yet one thing lured us into returning: safety and the hope for a better future. The Joint Way Forward deal between the European Union and Afghanistan misses this crucial point. 
In early October, the Afghan government and the EU signed this bilateral deal, which facilitates deportation of thousands of Afghan asylum seekers. In return, the EU promised to continue its generous aid package to Afghanistan. The deal promises job creation for returnees, emphasizes reintegration and resettlement programs, and ensures the safe return of vulnerable groups, in particular unaccompanied minors and women. 
None of these factors are enough to prevent hundreds of thousands of Afghans from taking the perilous journey toward Europe without a guarantee of security. After the fall of the Taliban, thousands of Afghan families returned to the war-torn country despite being aware of the existing limited opportunities. 
Peace, hope for the future and stability were the factors which drove Afghans back to their homeland for the first time since 2001. The irony is that the lack of these very notions in 2015 made thousands of others abandon the country. With more than 11,000 civilian casualties, 2015 is the worst year in terms of security since the fall of the Taliban. 
The Joint Way Forward is based on the illusion that Afghanistan is safe. Kunduz, one of the country's major cities, fell into the hands of the Taliban for the second time this year. The war forced hundreds to flee the city, while hundreds of others remained defenseless and stuck. 
In Badghis, a northwestern province, at least 60 police officers surrendered to the Taliban with their guns and resources. Three districts of Farah, a western province, already are ruled by insurgents. The Taliban rules many districts of Helmand province, and active war goes on in the city every so often. 
Nengarhar, Paktia, Paktika, Ghazni, and most other provinces are no better. Even the shortest highways—such as the Kabul-Ghazni, or Kabul-Wardak, routes—are controlled by the Taliban. Unknown numbers of people are being kidnapped or killed based on ethnic and religious reasons, or for having ties with foreign or government officials, on a regular basis. 
At least three bombs have exploded in different areas of Kabul since the deal was signed. By considering Afghanistan safe, despite the ongoing turmoil, the EU flinches from its humanitarian responsibility. 
Afghans have fled uncertainty, insecurity and the abusive policies of their government with the hopes of establishing a better life for themselves in Europe. They never imagined they would risk their entire lives to be sold back to the government they just escaped. More than a mere failure of security in Afghanistan, the EU-Afghan deal is a failure of humanity. 
Most EU countries warn their citizens against travelling to Afghanistan and mark it unsafe on their Foreign Affairs website. If it is not safe for EU citizens to spend a few days in Afghanistan, how is it safe for Afghans to live their whole lives there? Such deals reinforce double standards and spotlight how differently people's lives are valued in today's world. 
Europe's decision to deport Afghans is hasty, unconstructive and shortsighted. People's lives are being endangered for a second time. Statistics show that a great number of previous deportees already have attempted to return to Europe through Balkan routes. Many others lack social support to stay in Afghanistan after migrating to Europe from Pakistan or Iran. 
The deal is also unproductive for Europe, since it could lead to a repeat of the 2015 refugee crisis. 
The current bilateral EU-Afghan deal will be a colossal failure unless the EU forces the Afghan government to prioritize security. Dealing with corruption and regaining people's trust is the next big move to push people back to their homeland. 
The developed world should not use aid as a negotiating tool to pressurize poorer nations. 
People's lives are not political capital.

Editor's Note: Tom Hayden, an activist, author and longtime Truthdig contributor , died Sunday at age 76. In his memory, Truthdig will share one of Hayden's pieces each day this week. This story was originally posted on April 9, 2006. *** 
Author and political activist Tom Hayden speaks at length about his politics, the war in Iraq, Cuba-U.S. relations and a range of other topics with Cuban journalists in an interview for Juventud Rebelde . The English translation of the interview is published here in full, courtesy of Hayden. 
During the past five years, the American people have seen vivid pictures of American soldiers torturing prisoners. We now have evidence that the Bush administration is engaged in a massive domestic surveillance program, without judicial or congressional approval, that targets American citizens. President Bush ordered American soldiers to war over nonexistent weapons of mass destruction. The Bush administration and FEMA failed the people of New Orleans during the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Can you explain why the Bush administration seems immune from the political fallout that ordinarily results from such scandals? Why is there is no serious move to impeach the president for any or all of these scandals? 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
I do not wish to sound like an apologist, but the Bush administration is not immune. Legally, the cases against Libby and Abramoff and DeLay are slow-moving bad news for Bush. Politically, the Bush poll ratings are below the 40% range. Republican candidates for Congress are in trouble even though their congressional districts are designed to protect their power. As to impeachment, something like half of Americans favor impeachment or censure. If the Democrats win back the House this November, Rep. John Conyers will chair the Judiciary Committee and introduce impeachment. In general, American politics is still suffering from the stolen election of 2000, the chilling effects of 9/11, and the fabricated and unjustified invasion of iraq. Can you explain why the level of protests in the U.S. against the war in Iraq is not as notable as during the war in Vietnam? 
The difference is that during Vietnam there was a military draft and the number of casualties was far, far higher. Relatively speaking, therefore, the level of protests today is greater—200,000 in October 2002 in D.C.; 1 million in February 2003; 500,000 in New York in 2004; 300,000 in D.C. in 2005. The reformist presidential campaign of Howard Dean was larger than the antiwar Eugene McCarthy campaign of 1968. A majority of Americans, including a majority of U.S. soldiers, want a troop withdrawal within this year. The 'notable” difference, I believe, is that there was a broader radical movement around the world, certainly in 1968, than there is today. That makes the antiwar movement, here and globally, a surprising development, it seems to me. Do you envision an exit strategy for the U.S. in Iraq in the foreseeable future? 
There is an exit strategy available, with some support even within the Pentagon, but it is unlikely that Bush will adopt it. The strategy would consist of a U.S. announcement of withdrawal, a cease-fire by the Iraqi resistance during the withdrawal, an international peacekeeping force composed of countries not involved in the occupation, a transitional coalition in Baghdad, new elections under international auspices, a peacetime reconstruction, and reparations from the U.S. And UK. 
Bush may, and I emphasize may, begin withdrawing tens of thousands of U.S. troops this year in order to pacify antiwar sentiment, neutralize Democrats and keep control of the House of Representatives. One faction in the Pentagon calls this the 'Philippines option”—have your client government invite you to withdraw, so that it is perceived as a 'victory.” Recent trends in Latin America make it appear that it is no longer an American backyard. Venezuela, Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay are some of the countries that are taking an independent path to political and economic development. It would appear that with the expected election of Lopez Obrador, Mexico may soon join that list. What can we expect from the Bush administration with respect to Latin America in the coming months? 
I have traveled extensively in Latin America since 2000, and it is a place of exciting and dramatic developments, as you know. I think progressives across our boundaries should propose a new U.S. Latin American policy 'beyond the Monroe Doctrine.” We in the U.S. also must invigorate solidarity movements like those towards Central America and Cuba in past decades. It is a dangerous period because of the Bush administration. Towards Cuba, their malign intentions are well known. Towards Venezuela, they are defining a new security threat of 'radical populism,” and seeking ways to destabilize the democratically elected government. Even assassination of Hugo Chavez is an option that some are considering. On the trade front, the Bush team will try to divide Latin American countries through bilateral trade agreements. In the Andes, they will continue to send U.S. troops under the cover of the war on drugs. We note that you have always been an enemy of the so-called Free Trade Agreement that was so soundly defeated at the presidential summit in Argentina. Is that agreement dead and buried? Can you comment on the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas, known as ALBA? 
Latin America, along with U.S. social movements, has defeated the so-called Free Trade Agreement of the Americas for the foreseeable future. The World Trade Organization [WTO] is far from defeated, partly because of internal differences among Latin American countries. I believe the Bolivarian Alternative is an extremely important counterforce against the U.S. imperial design. Mercosur also is a welcome development. A united front among the new nationalist governments of Latin America is to be hoped for. Venezuela has recently been supplying heating oil at low cost for lower-income people in certain U.S. cities, yet some Republican congressmen have been critical of this gesture. Please comment. 
In general, the response to the Venezuelan initiative has been positive or neutral. Objections by some members of Congress is to be expected, because they want to prevent any U.S. acceptance of the Chavez government. The man many call the Osama bin Laden of Latin America, Luis Posada Carriles, is in the United States. He is wanted in Venezuela for 73 counts of first-degree murder in the downing of a civilian passenger plane in 1976, yet the Bush administration refuses to send him to Venezuela. How does that square with President Bushs so-called war on terror? 
Of course it is a contradiction. Unfortunately, there is little media attention to the issue up here. But the issue is a definite complication for the Bush administration's efforts to improve its status in Latin America. 
You were one of the Chicago 7 that Leonard Weinglass defended in 1968. Now Mr. Weinglass is one of the lead lawyers in the case of the Cuban Five. Do you think that anyone sympathetic to the Cuban revolution can get a fair trial in Miami? 
I have read the materials concerning the case, and believe it is a great untold story here. Of course, Leonard Weinglass is one of our greatest defense lawyers and is working constantly to generate political and media interest in the Cuban Five. No, a Cuban revolutionary cannot get a fair trial in Miami. But I believe the grip of the anti-Castro Cubans over Latin American policy has been weakened severely by events in Latin America and the recent growth of a vast Latino and immigrant movement in the United States. The Bush administration recently tightened travel restrictions for Americans wishing to travel to Cuba. Do Americans have a constitutional right to travel? 
They always have and always will. Bush is imposing a frustration on all of us, apparently to placate his Cuban allies in Miami. How will history judge the Bush administration? How does President Bush compare to other U.S. presidents in recent history? 
Who knows, but I think Bush will be marked with illegitimacy for the stolen election of 2000, fabrication and failure in Iraq, corruption and unconstitutional spying at home. Perhaps he will face impeachment, perhaps not. Certainly he is going through his Watergate moment today. It is important to speak of the system, however, not simply Bush. Since the disappearance of the Soviet Union, the U.S. has attempted to be the sole superpower in a so-called unipolar world. But its efforts towards military and economic empire have faltered and will be, in a sense, re-negotiated. As Hugo Chavez and others have argued, the reality is that we live in a multipolar world. The combination of massive social movements and the multipolarity of power will prevail over any forces seeking to dominate. As they say, another world is not only possible but is already being created. 
The United States cannot succeed with superpower tactics even on the baseball field. 
I know the horrors of U.S. imperialism in Latin America, but I hope that Latin American nationalists will welcome and reach out to the 'American people,” especially those in social movements and independent media but also those in political and economic sectors who have no interest in blockades, subversion, assassination or economic dominance. We are here, and our numbers are growing, especially because of the immigrants who are the 'harvest of empire” [in the words of Juan Gonzales]. Those who live in the imperial center cannot be expected to 'come to power” any time soon, but can restrain and complicate aggression and forge new policies which have the support of a majority of the U.S. people—out of Iraq, support for energy alternatives, funding for Katrina victims instead of war, civil liberties instead of secret tribunals and policing, no intervention in Venezuela, lifting the blockade on Cuba, and so forth. Strong support for such measures not only makes imperialism more difficult to sustain, but lays the basis for a broad center-left alternative which actually can succeed in the U.S. in the years ahead. It has nearly happened here before, in the 1930s and ‘40s before the Cold War, and again in the 1960s. Such moments will come again. TAGS:

Comments of the Week: Here Comes Trouble Posted on Oct 26, 2016 torbakhopper / CC BY-ND 2.0 
As is to be expected, if not applauded, the closer we get to the Nov. 8 election, the more debates and divisions have appeared in discussions about the headlines of the moment. 
During the week that ranged from Oct. 16-23, those headlines included additional revelations from WikiLeaks' trove of Pedesta emails regarding Hillary Clinton's campaign, as well as various writers' takes on how to vote this time around, and news of the ongoing Dakota Access pipeline protest. 
As for the how-to-vote issue, Jonathan Mitchell posted a short and direct comment under this story about Clinton's famous hawkishness when it comes to envisioning and enacting American foreign policy on the world stage: 

Reader Helen Hanna, like many others who took in Robert Reich's piece titled 'The Incalculable Damage of Doing Whatever It Takes to Win,” noticed and remarked upon Reich's gloss-over of Democratic Party leaders', and in particular Hillary and Bill Clinton's, proclivity for doing damage in the interest of maintaining power: 

That said, it's not as though commenters were about to give Donald Trump a pass, either. Take Ignatius J. Reilly's rejoinder to Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway's '5-point plan to defeat Islam,” as Trump and his team conceived of it (and Juan Cole wrote of it): 

Touché. 
Another point of contention on the comment boards last week had to do with how to evaluate WikiLeaks', and by extension Julian Assange's, latest release of documents in the Pedesta emails. Though some commentators like Naomi Klein and Glenn Greenwald have spoken up about particular aspects of WikiLeaks' current m.o., in the thread under Alexander Reed Kelly's Truthdigger of the Week column on Assange , reader JJG noted how, like him or not, Assange and his organization are providing a public service that professionals working in the mainstream press (who are supposed to be skilled in curating and redacting sensitive material) are not generally delivering on these days: 

We'll give Opa Westphal the last word this time, ending on an up note (in terms of the shout-out to other commenters) and a cautionary note at the same time. This one was posted under Chris Hedges' latest column , 'How Power Works”:

AT&T, Time Warner and the Death of Privacy   
By Amy Goodman and Denis Moynihan AT&T plans to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion. ( Mark Lennihan / AP ) 
It has been 140 years since Alexander Graham Bell uttered the first words through his experimental telephone, to his lab assistant: 'Mr. Watson—come here—I want to see you.” His invention transformed human communication, and the world. The company he started grew into a massive monopoly, AT&T. The federal government eventually deemed it too powerful, and broke up the telecom giant in 1982. Well, AT&T is back and some would say on track to become bigger and more powerful than before, announcing plans to acquire Time Warner, the media company, to create one of the largest entertainment and communications conglomerates on the planet. Beyond the threat to competition, the proposed merger—which still must pass regulatory scrutiny—poses significant threats to privacy and the basic freedom to communicate. AT&T is currently No. 10 on the Forbes 500 list of the U.S.'s highest-grossing companies. If it is allowed to buy Time Warner, No. 99 on the list, it will form an enormous, 'vertically integrated” company that controls a vast pool of content and how people access that content. Free Press, the national media policy and activism group, is mobilizing the public to oppose the deal. 'This merger would create a media powerhouse unlike anything we've ever seen before. AT&T would control mobile and wired internet access, cable channels, movie franchises, a film studio and more,” Candace Clement of Free Press wrote. 'That means AT&T would control internet access for hundreds of millions of people and the content they view, enabling it to prioritize its own offerings and use sneaky tricks to undermine net neutrality.” Net neutrality is that essential quality of the internet that makes it so powerful. Columbia University law professor Tim Wu coined the term 'net neutrality.” After the Federal Communications Commission approved strong net neutrality rules last year, Wu told us on the Democracy Now! News hour, 'There need to be basic rules of the road for the internet, and we're not going to trust cable and telephone companies to respect freedom of speech or respect new innovators, because of their poor track record.” Millions of citizens weighed in with public comments to the FCC in support of net neutrality, along with groups like Free Press and The Electronic Frontier Foundation. They were joined by titans of the internet like Google, Amazon and Microsoft. Arrayed against this coalition were the telecom and cable companies, the oligopoly of internet service providers that sell internet access to hundreds of millions of Americans. It remains to be seen if AT&T doesn't in practice break net neutrality rules and create a fast lane for its content and slow down content from its competitors, including the noncommercial sector. Another problem that AT&T presents, that would only be exacerbated by the merger, is the potential to invade the privacy of its millions of customers. In 2006, AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein revealed that the company was secretly sharing all of its customers' metadata with the National Security Agency. Klein, who installed the fiber-splitting hardware in a secret room at the main AT&T facility in San Francisco, had his whistleblowing allegations confirmed several years later by Edward Snowden's NSA leaks. While that dragnet surveillance program was supposedly shut down in 2011, a similar surveillance program still exists. It's called 'Project Hemisphere.” It was exposed by The New York Times in 2013, with substantiating documents just revealed this week in The Daily Beast. In 'Project Hemisphere,” AT&T sells metadata to law enforcement, under the aegis of the so-called war on drugs. A police agency sends in a request for all the data related to a particular person or telephone number, and, for a major fee and without a subpoena, AT&T delivers a sophisticated data set, that can, according to The Daily Beast, 'determine where a target is located, with whom he speaks, and potentially why.” Where you go, what you watch, text and share, with whom you speak, all your internet searches and preferences, all gathered and 'vertically integrated,” sold to police and perhaps, in the future, to any number of AT&T's corporate customers. We can't know if Alexander Graham Bell envisioned this brave new digital world when he invented the telephone. But this is the future that is fast approaching, unless people rise up and stop this merger.

Live at Truthdig: What Do the Dakota Access Pipeline Arrests Mean for First Amendment Rights?   Protesters square off against law enforcement during a demonstration against the Dakota Access Pipeline. (Screen shot via The Intercept ) 
This past weekend, 127 people were arrested at the construction site of the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline. Since the demonstrations began this summer, over 260 people have been arrested. 
Among those facing legal retribution for demonstrating alongside members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe is Democracy Now! journalist Amy Goodman, who was initially brought up on 'riot” charges, although these charges were later dropped . Actress Shailene Woodley made mainstream media headlines when she was arrested earlier this month during a peaceful protest—a process she streamed live onto her Facebook page. And award-winning documentary filmmaker Deia Schlosberg faces decades in prison for documenting the protests. 
There's a common thread linking Goodman, Woodley and Schlosberg: each incurred criminal charges after documenting the protests in some form. Woodley, during her Facebook live stream, states that she is being singled out by law enforcement 'because I have 40,000 people watching.” Goodman, speaking after her own charges were dismissed, declared that 'the state's attorney was attempting to stop journalism.” 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Schlosberg, however, faces the highest consequences for filming protesters earlier this month: up to 45 days of jail time. The Guardian reports : 
Schlosberg, a New York-based film-maker, is facing three felony conspiracy charges for filming protesters on 11 October at a TransCanada Keystone Pipeline site in Pembina County in North Dakota, with prosecutors alleging that she was 'recruited to record the criminal activity”. 
Schlosberg recently spoke with Goodman on Democracy Now! and explained the charges against her . 'Conspiracy—they were all conspiracy charges: conspiracy to theft of public—theft of property, conspiracy to theft of service and conspiracy of interfering with a public—a critical public infrastructure.” She outlines the situation that led to her arrest: 
I was filming the action. I was on public land. I was on a public road and at no point trespassed, at no point, you know, broke in or destroyed any property. I had nothing to do with the planning of the event. I was there to document it. I think it's essential for journalists to—journalists and filmmakers to go where the mainstream media is not. And there's a major hole in the coverage of climate change and people that are already dealing with the consequences of climate change and people that are fighting climate change. So, I take that responsibility very seriously. 
Filmmaker Josh Fox, whose documentary ' How to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Can't Change ” was produced by Schlosberg, has been extremely vocal about her arrest and what it means for a free press. 
'Never did I ever think that the biggest threat to her life, of her livelihood, would be the United States government and our police force,” Fox told Goodman on Democracy Now!. He labels the charges against Schlosberg, Goodman and Woodley as a 'brutal repression of the media,” and explains how police are infringing on constitutional rights. 'These people are not accessories to the crime, they are the media,” he says. 'This is a First Amendment, constitutionally protected activity.” 
Fox continues: 
It makes me terrified for the future of our profession. We need to be able to operate as documentarians. We need to be able to operate as independent media that are allowed to bring these stories to the public. And it's constitutionally protected. And we won't rest. 
Many have rallied behind Schlosberg by signing an open letter that Fox wrote to President Obama. 'Journalism, especially documentary filmmaking, is not a crime, it's a responsibility,” Fox wrote. Celebrities like Neil Young, Mark Ruffalo and Daryl Hannah are among those who have signed their names to the open letter. 
On Thursday, Oct. 27 at 1 p.m. PDT / 4 p.m. EDT, the Truthdig team will sit down with Schlosberg and Fox to discuss the impact of these arrests on journalistic freedom. How can journalists protect their First Amendment rights? What do the hundreds of arrests say about the current state of American democracy? 
Groundbreaking technology has also been used to cover the protests. New media like Facebook Live and Twitter give an on-the-ground, direct look into the demonstrations. Last weekend, law enforcement shot down a drone used by the protesters to document their interactions with police. How does new technology play a role in journalism and freedom of the press? 
Join us on Thursday by tuning into our Facebook page for the live video stream. Please leave any questions for Schlosberg and Fox in the comments section below. You can watch past editions of 'Live at Truthdig” on our YouTube page .

Native American Project Urges Political Involvement, Representation Beyond Standing Rock Posted on Oct 26, 2016 ( Vox Efx / CC 2.0 ) 
Fighting back against decades of exclusion from the voting process and underrepresentation in government, Native Americans across the United States are struggling to have their voices heard beyond the Dakota Access pipeline protest—within local, state and federal elections. 
According to a report released Tuesday by Advance Native Political Leadership (ANPL), Native Americans suffer from injustice in voting rights, intimidation tactics, unequal access to polls and 'gross underrepresentation … at every level of government,” which prevent people from '[seeing] themselves in these elections.” 
But, the report argues, Native American representation in elected offices is necessary to secure a democracy that reflects the increasingly diverse American population. 
'If we want to see race equity in the United States, we can't get there without Native Americans being represented in political office,” the report's lead author, Chrissie Castro, director of the ANPL and a citizen of the Navajo Nation, told Truthdig. 'The issues and concerns that Native Americans have are what everyone cares about. … We say that we want more Native American elected officials in political office because this is about everyone—this inclusive picture of democracy is about all of us.” 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Of 41,000 elected officials in the United States, 90 percent are white and 0.03 percent are Native American, the lowest percentage of any minority group, according to the Reflective Democracy Campaign , a project of the Women Donors Network . Native Americans have held few positions on the federal level—'one vice president, eight House representatives and two Senators,” according to the report. 
'We're the first ones here, and we're the last ones to have the opportunity to vote,” Brian Cladoosby, president of the National Congress of American Indians, said of Native American communities. Native Americans across the country face barriers that systematically prevent them from voting , such as out-of-the-way polling booths, mail-in ballots sent only to those who have mailing addresses, refusal of state citizenship and bans from voting in state elections in states such as Arizona and New Mexico, which have significant Native populations. 
'We were the first peoples of this country, and yet we are not part of the governance of this country, and we think that's a real miss,” Castro said. 'In order for us to get ourselves into elected office, we need people to elect us. What we've seen time and time again is that there are structural barriers that really dilute the Native vote or make it very difficult [to get] into elected office.” 
'We are having to deal with a colonial legacy that was intended to exclude us,” Chase Iron Eyes of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, who is running for the House of Representatives in North Dakota, told BBC News . 
Some Native American communities don't see themselves as a significant part of the electorate. But while they make up less than 2 percent of the total U.S. population, they can make a difference in an election. 
'We are really working to change our cultural norms around our relationship with voting. … We're doing the hard work of culture shift to say that it is important that we participate,” Castro said. 'The Native vote does matter.” 
The Native vote has made a difference, the report says, in swing or battleground states with significant Native American populations that overwhelmingly lean Democratic. In 2012, Colorlines reports, Democratic candidates' victories in some of the tightest Senate races in New Mexico, Montana and North Dakota are attributed to the Native vote . 
Presidential hopefuls Dr. Jill Stein and Sen. Bernie Sanders understood the power of the Native vote, Castro said. Sanders brought on a Native American adviser, Tara Houska, and Stein joined the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's protests . During the primaries, Secretary Clinton met with tribal leaders in Iowa, Washington, Arizona and California, according to BBC News. 
According to the report, the Democratic Party has a formal infrastructure that is inclusive of Native Americans, including several Democratic Native American caucuses on the West Coast and a national director of Native American outreach. However, various Republican representatives told Castro that there is no comparable infrastructure in the GOP. 
The Dakota Access pipeline protest has helped bring Native American issues to the forefront, Castro said. 
'I think the Dakota Access pipeline has really galvanized the Native American community across the country and even internationally,” she said. 'At Standing Rock, there's been a lot of work to do canvassing and [engaging] voters as part of a strategy to make sure people that are in elected office understand the issues and the experiences of Native American people.” 
Though the numbers this year are promising, with a record of eight Native American candidates running for Congress and more than 90 running for state legislatures, there needs to be 'pathways” in place for future Native American politicians to make their way on to the ballot, the report argues. One way Native politicians can have equal access to government offices is for accurate data on Native Americans to be available so they could use the information to design voter turnout strategies. Currently, in California, there is data on numerous minority groups, but not Native American voters. 
There has been some recent success in bringing out the Native vote. Since its launch three months ago, Native Vote has registered 1,000 Native American voters in California, Castro said, calling this a necessary and robust Native American voter engagement campaign. Your #NativeVote makes a difference, and together, Indian Country's voices count! #RestoreTheVRA — Native Vote (@nativevote) Oct. 20, 2016 
In 2017, ANPL will launch pilot projects in Montana and New Mexico that will 'build a pathway for Native American elected officials” by teaching children the importance of civic engagement and providing training for potential campaign managers and team members. Portland and Los Angeles will also host pilot projects on a local level, since more than 70 percent of Native Americans live away from reservations, in cities and suburbs. 
'We thought it was important to start looking at municipal races, to look at school boards, water boards, looking at city planning commissions, and really building infrastructure in municipals for elected and appointed positions to make sure our voices are heard at the local level,” Castro said. 
'I think as Native Americans we are taking our rightful place as part of the fabric of leadership in this country. I think that we're going to see good things if we're able to see a more reflective democracy that's inclusive of Native American peoples [and] of all of the diversity that exists in this country that we don't see in these positions of power and decision-making.” 
Castro is hopeful that Sen. Jon Tester's (D-MT) proposed bill, the 2015 Native American Voting Rights Act , will pass next year and 'right the wrongs” to protect Native American access to the polls. 
'We have a lot of work to do to make sure that people see themselves in these elections,” she said. TAGS:

The 'Two-Party Racket' Is Incapable of Dealing With Our Present Crises   Ian Sane / (CC-BY-2.0) 
'Indications that Clinton is heading towards a solid win” might suggest that 2016 is 'the safest year ever to vote Green, right?” No, say Democrats. 
'Dems will never admit it's a good time to go Green,” writes Scott McLarty, media coordinator for the Green Party, at The Hill. 'They want a field permanently limited to two parties of war and Wall Street.” 
To understand what we've lost under the two-party racket, compare the cringeworthy Clinton-Trump debates with Green nominee Jill Stein's rebuttals. 
Stein addressed issues that were either touched on superficially or absent from the bipartisan bicker-fest. She proposed solutions — especially the Green New Deal. Progressive ideas, the kind advanced by Bernie Sanders in his call for political revolution, are effectively censored in the debates. 
Marginalization of alt-parties in the late 20th century is one of the unmentioned reasons for the triumph of the right wing in both major parties. It explains the disappearance of big progressive ideas like FDR's New Deal and LBJ's Great Society. 
The Green New Deal is a vision of how we can improve the lives of millions of people and rescue the planet from climate chaos. 
Today's Democrats give us no such vision. All they've offered is modest reforms, ideas that pretended to be progressive but aren't (e.g., Obamacare, originally Romneycare), and slogans like 'Change We Can Believe In.” The vision Hillary Clinton evokes is 'I'm not Trump.” 
The two-party racket is incapable of dealing with the crises of the 21st century: climate change; creeping corporate oligarchy and economic inequality; the national-security/mass-incarceration state; endless war. 
These crises promise an era of deteriorating quality of life, increasing personal debt, eroded rights and freedoms, lawless militarism, and social breakdown. The danger they pose can be compared with the rise of totalitarian states and the Cold War's nuclear menace during the 20th century.

$23 How Deep Will 2016's Blue Wave Be? Progressives Push Candidates, Issues Up and Down Political Ladder   Steven Rosenfeld / AlterNet Jason Morrison / CC BY-NC 2.0 
As the 2016 election closes, progressives are on the frontline of the latest rallying cry by Democrats Hillary Clinton, Tim Kaine, President Obama and the rest of the party's leaders to sweep Republicans out of office up and down the political ladder.It's no secret the Clinton campaign, its surrogates and state party operations have built and unleashed a giant ground game, registering voters and urging them to turn out, with five times as many paid staffers as the GOP. But a parallel track is unfolding in progressive circles, where collectively, groups like Democracy for America, Progressive Democrats of America, Our Revolution and others are pushing, promoting, fundraising for and urging their ranks—even those who don't like Clinton—to elect scores of other candidates and vote on statewide ballot measures to move a progressive agenda. 
'I think there is growing confidence that we can win the presidential election. So that's not new,” said Neil Sroka, spokesman for Democracy for America, which has endorsed 125 candidates . 'What we have been focusing on are the down-ballot races, the U.S. Senate races that up until recently haven't started getting a lot of attention. But also on city council races and state legislative races.”'On November 8, we can measure how successful the progressive political revolution has been,” said Shannon Jackson, executive director of Our Revolution , which grew out of Bernie Sanders' campaign. 'We have 105 progressive champions we are supporting. We have 31 different ballot races we are behind. We're calling, we're texting, we are organizing online. We are doing e-mails. We are assisting through our fundraising. We want to make sure they have the tools available to them so they can succeed.”In some cases, mainstream Democrats and progressive groups are supporting the same candidates and taking the same stances on ballot measures, such as pushing for health care reforms, raising the minimum wage and enacting campaign finance reform. But in other cases, the progressives are further to the left, embracing all forms of marijuana legalization, repealing the death penalty and opposing charter school expansion and anti-union right-to-work ballot measures. Donna Smith, executive director of Progressive Democrats of America , gave two examples illustrating these parallel tracks. 
'PDA is intensely focused on electing Doug Applegate in California's 49th Congressional District, where defeating Darrell Issa would be an added bonus,” she said, referring to a Republican who has repeatedly sought to undermine President Obama. 'Applegate is a strong progressive who has been attacked by Issa on his progressive stands as highlighted by the PDA endorsement questionnaire. We have put substantial resources into that race.”'We are also backing Nanette Barragan, CA CD-44, where even in a relatively safe Democratic district we must push to make sure we elect the most progressive candidate with a solid, respected track record,” Smith continued. 'Across the country we have focused on other congressional races where we can make real inroads and where we can still see hope for the policy agenda Sen. Bernie Sanders so brilliantly articulated during the presidential primary. The challenge has been to overcome some voter fatigue in areas where the coverage of the presidential contest has overshadowed many of these critical congressional races.” The open question for progressives like Smith, who want to see the political landscape reshuffled to the left, and also for the Clinton campaign, which is urging Democrats to retake congressional majorities and governors' mansions, is how much attention will voters pay to down-ballot races? With Election Day quickly approaching, these groups are making every effort to engage them. This goes beyond the fundraising bonanza Paul Ryan unleashed when he groused that a Democratic Senate majority would put Sanders in the Senate Budget Committee chairman's seat, which DFA and Our Revolution seized on to raise several million dollars online for their candidates. DFA, for example, is pushing its Washington and Colorado members to pay attention to their state senate races, because picking up one or two seats would shift the legislative majority from red to blue. 'If you can get people volunteering and taking action to support a candidate for local state legislature, those votes will trickle up,” said Sroka, referring to the likelihood that people working hard for local races would end up supporting the federal candidates. 'Also, there are some progressive Democrats who aren't super excited about the presidential race, and so that's okay.”'We want to make sure that there's a space for everyone in the fight to November,” he continued, 'because frankly, we need everyone's help. So focusing on the Senate race in North Carolina, as one example, is another one that until recently folks weren't focusing on [nationally]. We were paying attention to it, because it's a place where people could take action, have a meaningful role and help the ticket as well.”Sroka said DFA and Our Revolution are coordinating, explaining that DFA has more on-the-ground experience and a better grassroots network at this stage of the campaign, while Our Revolution is more of an online community. Jackson agreed, saying many Sanders supporters needed to pause after the Democratic Convention but rejoined the fray after Labor Day. Raising $2 million in 72 hours after Ryan's remarks showed how potent these progressives remain, injecting needed funds into dozens of races.'We want to make sure they have the tools available to them so they can succeed,” Jackson said. 'From [U.S. House candidate] Zephyr Teachout in New York, from [U.S. House] candidate Pramila Jayapal out in Washington, from coast to coast. However you measure it, we are going to see progressive champions winning seats from school board to state senate to U.S. representatives and senators.” It's hard to dissect all the factors that prompt voter registration and turnout. But registration for the 2016 election has closed in many states, with the number of registered voters across America breaching the 200 million mark for the first time. Meanwhile, ballots cast in early voting by registered Democrats are outpacing Republicans in many states at a comparable period before the 2012 election, according to media reports from Florida , North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and Arizona .'When we look at the early voting numbers, we go, hmm. Something definitely is going on. Something different from the past. But it's very much on a state-by-state basis,” Sroka said. 'What we do know is whether it is Florida or North Carolina or Nevada, Democrats are taking advantage of the organization structure they have on the ground this year in a significant way.” 
  
'That kind of success… is a reflection of grassroots power,” he continued. 'To get those kinds of numbers we are seeing with early voting takes contacts for volunteers, or contacts from the campaign. It's reflective of the kind of ground game that the Democrats may have over Republicans looking at the country overall.”That ground game isn't just coming from what's called the coordinated Democratic campaign—the presidential and state party effort. In Nevada, big multi-ethnic unions like the Culinary Workers have been pushing voter registration for months and are now focusing on get-out-the-vote efforts. In California, the National Nurses United union and Sanders have been pushing a ballot measure requiring state government health programs pay the same price for drugs as the federal Veterans Administration, which would cut costs. That's not the only health care proposal pushed by Our Revolution. Colorado will vote on creating a statewide single-payer system.Down-ballot candidates and statewide initiative measures often don't get as many votes as the presidential campaign; people just skip them if they're not sure, which means they can pass or fail by smaller margins. Jackson said he did not know the latest polling on all of the statewide measures pushed or opposed by Our Revolution. But on those where he did review recent surveys, Jackson said it looks like many progressive positions are going to win.That appeared to be the case with the California drug-pricing measure, another California proposal to repeal the state's death penalty, measures in California and Washington calling for overturning the Supreme Court's Citizens United campaign finance decision, the medical or recreational marijuana legalization measures (outside the South), minimum wage hikes in Maine and Washington, and opposing charter school expansion in Massachusetts. Our Revolution is also pushing an automatic statewide voter registration proposal in Alaska, where any resident who receives an annual oil industry dividend from the state—including 50,000 Native Alaskans—would be on voter lists.So while the mainsteam media coverage is centered on the Clinton campaign and its enlarged focus to retake the Senate and shrink Republican majorities in the House and state capitals, the efforts of progressive groups, working inside and outside of traditional Democratic circles, may determine how deep and wide 2016's blue wave will be.

Donald Trump Says Hillary Clinton Will Start WWIII With Russia, but Moscow Disagrees (Video)   Juan Cole / Informed Comment 
Donald Trump alleged on Tuesday that if elected, Hillary Clinton would start World War III with Russia over Syria. He wondered how Clinton would be able to negotiate with Putin, whom she has demonized, and said that her plan for a no-fly zone over Syria would bring her into military conflict with the Russian Aerospace Forces flying missions over that country. To be fair, as the BBC points out, the US generals do share Trumps concerns in this regard. 
Joseph Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Marine General Joseph Dunford, told the Senate Armed Services Committee, 'Right now, senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia.” 
Trump pointed out that Russia has a nuclear arsenal, making brinkmanship with it extremely risky. 
Trump is not reckoning, however, with Clinton's extensive experience as Secretary of State, a job that is all about negotiation and horse trading and compromise. In fact, the position has pragmatism so baked into it that its incumbent often offends ideologues in Congress. It is no wonder that the office has not been a springboard to the presidency since the early decades of the republic. 
Superpowers don't fight one another in the nuclear age. If Russia brandishes enough threats and weaponry, it will simply dissuade Clinton from her proposed no-fly zone. Ike Eisenhower back down over Hungary in 1956, and Johnson did nothing about the crushing of the Prague Spring in 1968. Russia is claiming Syria as a sphere of influence, and while the US is contesting that claim, it is unlikely to go mano a mano with Moscow over it. 
  
Superpowers fight proxy wars like Vietnam and Afghanistan. So is it possible that Clinton will give Syrian rebels shoulder-held missile launchers to use against Russian fighter jets? Sure. Although one reason that hasn't been done is that they could end up being used against the Israelis. In any case, that Clinton will engage in a proxy war with Russia over Syria with far more vigor than President Obama is fairly obvious. That it will spiral out of hand is actually fairly unlikely, though it can't be ruled out. 
Interestingly, many high Russian officials and commentators in the Russian press, according to BBC Monitoring, do not agree with Mr. Trump, and indeed see Clinton as the pragmatist: 
'Moskovsky Komsomolets (popular Moscow daily) www.mk.ru –'The Russian leadership hopes that pragmatism will prevail in US foreign policy after the presidential election… And Hillary Clinton is the one whom the Kremlin sees in the role of this main foreign policy pragmatist… Trump would, of course, be a more convenient partner than Clinton but the Kremlin has realised: no matter what its wishes and preferences are, Trump will not become president…” 
The article continues that it is the Kremlin that is playing brinkmanship, not Clinton, saying that Moscow has deliberately made relations so tense that Clinton may be forced to back down rather than risk a hot war. Editorial writer Mikhail Rostovsky does admit that if Clinton instead ratchets up tensions, 'things could get out of hand.” 
Russian journalists and officialdom seem largely to have written off Trump. Victoria Zhuravleva, senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of International Relations and World Economy, wrote in Lyubov Glazunova that 'the campaign for Trump is most likely to be over.” 
Stanislav Ivanov, 'Carte blanche. Storming Mosul: what is next?”; bit.ly/2e5JL0b in Nezavisimaya Gazeta (centrist daily) www.ng.ru , says that Washington's policy is to turn the Middle East into an arena of conflict between the Gulf monarchies and Iran. He expects the Mosul campaign to be prolonged, but for the Baghdad government to win in the end: 'Under this scenario, Iraq and Syria may remain hostages to this confrontation for years to come and turn into a ground of permanent armed conflicts. The overseas puppet masters will try to take advantage of the existing ethnic and religious conflicts in the region.” 
The Russian press is also not concerned that Russia will be sanctioned over its air campaign against fundamentalist rebel forces in East Aleppo. 
So, rather than the chicken little hysteria of Trump about a world war and nuclear exchanges, many in the Kremlin see him as less pragmatic than Clinton and are expecting to work with her. They have already discounted the possibility of a Trump presidency, and so are readying themselves for a Clinton administration. The Russians met with Clinton a lot when she was Secretary of State and so know her well. They think she will blink rather than take US-Russian relations to the boiling point, and they admit that the Kremlin as the one playing brinksmanship. Trump can't even get support for his wild charges from the the Kremlin itself, which sounds positively even-handed and practical in comparison. TAGS:

Urban Population Booms Will Make Climate Change Worse Posted on Oct 27, 2016 
By Tim Radford / Climate News Network Flooded slums in the densely-populated city of Jakarta, Indonesia. (Kent Clark via Flickr) 
LONDON—The world's cities are growing even faster than the human population. Within the last 40 years, the global population has increased by a factor of 1.8, but built-up areas have multiplied 2.5 times . All of this information, and much more, appears in a new European Commission (EC) publication called the Atlas of the Human Planet , prepared to coincide with the recent third UN Habitat conference in Quito, Ecuador. The Atlas shows that, 40 years ago, most of the world's 4.1billion population lived in rural areas. Now more than half live in towns and cities—urban clusters that cover 7.6% of the planet's land mass, equivalent to an area about half the size of the European Union. Most of the people in the world are crammed into urban centres with a density greater than 1,500 persons per square kilometre, and in settlements greater than 50,000 inhabitants. Altogether, geographers have identified 13,000 urban centres, altogether surrounded by 300,000 'urban clusters” of at least 5,000 inhabitants living at a density of 300 per square kilometre. Population tripled And in the 40 years since the first UN Habitat conference in 1976, the population of Africa has tripled, while the built-up area of the continent has quadrupled. In wealthy Europe, the population remained stable, but the built-up area doubled. The research for the Atlas has been enriched by a new, free, open and global dataset, the Global Human Settlement Layer , developed by the EC's Joint Research Centre , and based on 12,400 billion individual satellite data readings over the past four decades. It provides, in every sense, an overview of a planet at work and at rest and struggling to survive. It confirms what most people would have suspected: that nine of the 10 most densely populated urban centres—including Cairo in Egypt, Guangzhou in China, and Jakarta in Indonesia—are in the low-income countries. Researchers warn that whatever problems these new city-dwellers have will be compounded by climate change The largest urban centre in the world is Los Angeles in the US, eight of the 10 largest urban centres are in the high-income countries, and five of those are in the US. And a group of scientists led by Timon McPhearson, assistant professor of urban ecology at the New School in New York , publish a warning in Nature journal that more urban areas will be built in the next 30 years than ever before just to house and shelter the additional 1.1billion people expected in the next 14 years—most of them in the crowded cities of Asia and Africa. Whatever problems these new city-dwellers have will be compounded, other researchers warn, by climate change —with ever more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, floods , and days of bad air quality. Around 40% of the world's people live in coastal cities, and are therefore increasingly vulnerable to floods , tsunamis, surges and tropical storms. Because of the notorious urban 'heat island effect”, cities are inevitably hotter than the surrounding countryside , and many are likely to face a crisis in the supply of safe, clean water . Swelling cities The new Atlas warns that the new, swelling cities will go on making ever greater demands on the farmland and wilderness beyond the city's boundaries. In the last 15 years, 27,000 sq km of land was covered by housing, workshops and pavement. This is an area equal to Cyprus and Israel combined. If this growth continues at the present rate, an additional 1.1 million sq km of land will become built-up between 2015 and 2040—an area equal to the size of Ethiopia. In 119 countries, the urban population is between 70% and 90% of the total. In 25 countries—most of them in Asia—the city dwellers make up 90% of the population. Many of these are in megacities. The atlas records 50 'urban clusters” of more than 10 million people, and one gigacity—Beijing—that is home to more than 100 million. Inevitably, in this growth explosion, the poorest are often most at risk, from floods, landslides, and other geophysical and climate-related potential disasters. In the last 40 years, the number of people living at or even below sea level has almost doubled from 45 million to 88 million, and the number living on steep slopes has increased from 70 million to 160 million. 
Tim Radford, a founding editor of Climate News Network, worked for The Guardian for 32 years, for most of that time as science editor. He has been covering climate change since 1988.

Police Attack and Arrest Peaceful Protesters at the Dakota Access Pipeline Posted on Oct 27, 2016 
Near Standing Rock, North Dakota on Oct. 22, armed police corralled and arrested more than 140 people seeking to protect themselves, their cultural heritage and the health of the planet on the site where contractors bulldozed the peoples' ancestral burial ground to make way for the construction of an oil pipeline. 
Jihan Hafiz, a journalist for The Intercept who was among the arrested, filmed the clip above, which is among the most compelling eye-level footage of the months-long protest of the Dakota Access Oil Pipeline, which is led by members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and reservation. 
After a morning of prayer, the protesters 'were attacked by police forces who used pepper spray and beat protesters with batons,” Hafiz wrote . 'Dozens of officers, backed by military trucks, police vans, machine guns, and nonlethal weapons, violently approached the group without warning.” 
As the protesters attempted to leave, the police began beating and detaining them. Several Native American women leading the march were targeted, dragged out of the crowd, and arrested. One man was body-slammed to the ground, while another woman broke her ankle running from the police. The military and police trucks followed the protesters as nearly a hundred officers corralled the protesters into a circle. Among the arrested were journalists, a 17-year-old pregnant girl, and a 78-year-old woman. 
In total, more than 140 people were detained in half an hour. It was the largest roundup of protesters since the movement against the pipelines intensified two months ago. A majority of those arrested were charged with rioting and criminal trespass. Overall, close to 300 people have been arrested since protests against the pipeline kicked off over the summer.

When we arrived in Mandan, the jail was so overwhelmed with people that we had to sit on the floor in the jail's common area. Two Native American men were thrown into solitary confinement. A number of women faced humiliating strip searches, which included spreading their body parts and jumping up and down while coughing. We were refused phone calls and received no food or water for eight hours after being arrested. Two women fainted from low blood sugar and another had her medication taken away, causing her to shake and sweat profusely. 
When I was released from jail, my camera was missing. When I asked about its whereabouts, a police officer said, 'Your camera is being held as evidence in a crime.” 
The video footage presented here was shot from the beginning of the march, during the prayer, and ends the moment I was arrested. Many families, nearly all of them Native American, can be seen running for the hills. Many people told me they felt as though they were re-enacting the massacres of the Lakota nation during the westward expansion of the United States, when families were shot in the back as they fled.

Insurance Prices for Many Obamacare Customers Will Rise By Double Digits in 2017   
The cost of private health insurance arranged under President Obama's health care law will rise by double-digit percentages and many Americans will have only one insurer to choose from, the White House confirmed. 
The Associated Press reports : 
Before taxpayer-provided subsidies, premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services. Some states will see much bigger jumps, others less. 
Moreover, about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from, after major national carriers such as UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Aetna scaled back their roles. 
'Consumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period,” said Larry Levitt, who tracks the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. … 
In some states, the premium increases are striking. In Arizona, unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark 'second-lowest cost silver plan” will jump by 116 percent, from $196 to $422, according to the administration report. 
But HHS said if that hypothetical consumer has a fairly modest income, making $25,000 a year, the subsidies would cover $280 of the new premium, and the consumer would pay $142. Caveat: if the consumer is making $30,000 or $40,000 his or her subsidy would be significantly lower. 
The total number of insurers will drop from 232 this year to 167 in 2017, a loss of 28 percent. Switching will be a burden for patients with chronic conditions or other complications. 
While many carriers are offering a choice of plan designs, most use a single prescription formulary and physician network across all their products, explained Pearson. 'So, enrollees may need to change doctors or drugs when they switch insurers,” she said. 
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has proposed 'an array of fixes, including sweetening the law's subsidies and allowing more people to qualify for financial assistance,” AP reports. Americans will deliver profits to insurance companies either way, as subsidy money comes from taxpayers and represents a loss of public services Americans could otherwise provide themselves.

Why Is It So Hard to Reduce the Pentagon Budget?   
By William D. Hartung / TomDispatch David B. Gleason / CC BY-SA 2.0 
Through good times and bad, regardless of what's actually happening in the world, one thing is certain: in the long run, the Pentagon budget won't go down. 
It's not that that budget has never been reduced. At pivotal moments, like the end of World War II as well as war's end in Korea and Vietnam, there were indeed temporary downturns, as there was after the Cold War ended. More recently, the Budget Control Act of 2011 threw a monkey wrench into the Pentagon's plans for funding that would go ever onward and upward by putting a cap on the money Congress could pony up for it. The remarkable thing, though, is not that such moments have occurred, but how modest and short-lived they've proved to be. 
Take the current budget. It's down slightly from its peak in 2011, when it reached the highest level since World War II, but this year's budget for the Pentagon and related agencies is nothing to sneeze at. It comes in at roughly $600 billion — more than the peak year of the massive arms build-up initiated by President Ronald Reagan back in the 1980s. To put this figure in perspective: despite troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan dropping sharply over the past eight years, the Obama administration has still managed to spend more on the Pentagon than the Bush administration did during its two terms in office. 
What accounts for the Department of Defense's ability to keep a stranglehold on your tax dollars year after endless year? 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Pillar one supporting that edifice: ideology. As long as most Americans accept the notion that it is the God-given mission and right of the United States to go anywhere on the planet and do more or less anything it cares to do with its military, you won't see Pentagon spending brought under real control. Think of this as the military corollary to American exceptionalism—or just call it the doctrine of armed exceptionalism, if you will. 
The second pillar supporting lavish military budgets (and this will hardly surprise you): the entrenched power of the arms lobby and its allies in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. The strategic placement of arms production facilities and military bases in key states and Congressional districts has created an economic dependency that has saved many a flawed weapons system from being unceremoniously dumped in the trash bin of history. 
Lockheed Martin, for instance, has put together a handy map of how its troubled F-35 fighter jet has created 125,000 jobs in 46 states. The actual figures are, in fact, considerably lower, but the principle holds: having subcontractors in dozens of states makes it harder for members of Congress to consider cutting or slowing down even a failed or failing program. Take as an example the M-1 tank, which the Army actually wanted to stop buying. Its plans were thwarted by the Ohio congressional delegation, which led a fight to add more M-1s to the budget in order to keep the General Dynamics production line in Lima, Ohio, up and running. In a similar fashion, prodded by the Missouri delegation, Congress added two different versions of Boeing's F-18 aircraft to the budget to keep funds flowing to that company's St. Louis area plant. 
The one-two punch of an environment in which the military can do no wrong, while being outfitted for every global task imaginable, and what former Pentagon analyst Franklin 'Chuck” Spinney has called ' political engineering ,” has been a tough combination to beat. 
'Scare the Hell Out of the American People” 
The overwhelming consensus in favor of a 'cover the globe” military strategy has been broken from time to time by popular resistance to the idea of using war as a central tool of foreign policy. In such periods, getting Americans behind a program of feeding the military machine massive sums of money has generally required a heavy dose of fear. 
For example, the last thing most Americans wanted after the devastation and hardship unleashed by World War II was to immediately put the country back on a war footing. The demobilization of millions of soldiers and a sharp cutback in weapons spending in the immediate postwar years rocked what President Dwight Eisenhower would later dub the 'military-industrial complex.” 
As Wayne Biddle has noted in his seminal book Barons of the Sky ,the U.S. aerospace industry produced an astonishing 300,000-plus military aircraft during World War II. Not surprisingly, major weapons producers struggled to survive in a peacetime environment in which government demand for their products threatened to be a tiny fraction of wartime levels. 
Lockheed President Robert Gross was terrified by the potential impact of war's end on his company's business, as were many of his industry cohorts. 'As long as I live,” he said , 'I will never forget those short, appalling weeks” of the immediate postwar period. To be clear, Gross was appalled not by the war itself, but by the drop off in orders occasioned by its end. He elaborated in a 1947 letter to a friend: 'We had one underlying element of comfort and reassurance during the war. We knew we'd get paid for anything we built. Now we are almost entirely on our own.” 
The postwar doldrums in military spending that worried him so were reversed only after the American public had been fed a steady, fear-filled diet of anti-communism. NSC-68 , a secret memorandum the National Security Council prepared for President Harry Truman in April 1950, created the template for a policy based on the global 'containment” of communism and grounded in a plan to encircle the Soviet Union with U.S. military forces, bases, and alliances. This would, of course, prove to be a strikingly expensive proposition. The concluding paragraphs of that memorandum underscored exactly that point, calling for a 'sustained buildup of U.S. political, economic, and military strength… [to] frustrate the Kremlin design of a world dominated by its will.”

FCC Passes Sweeping Internet Privacy Rules in 'Big Win for Civil Rights' Posted on Oct 27, 2016 Shutterstock 
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Thursday passed sweeping new privacy rules designed to keep broadband providers from giving customers' private data to third parties. 
The rules, approved by a vote of 3-2, require Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to get customers' explicit consent before using or sharing behavioral data like browsing history, location, and other sensitive information with marketing firms or other companies, the Washington Post reports . 
'It's the consumers' information,” FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said. 'How it is used should be the consumers' choice. Not the choice of some corporate algorithm.” 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
According to the Post's Brian Fung: 
Also covered by that requirement are health data, financial information, Social Security numbers and the content of emails and other digital messages. The measure allows the FCC to impose the opt-in rule on other types of information in the future, but certain types of data, such as a customer's IP address and device identifier, are not subject to the opt-in requirement. The rules also force service providers to tell consumers clearly what data they collect and why, as well as to take steps to notify customers of data breaches. 
However, the new rules do not require providers to get clear permission before using the data themselves. 
Still, watchdog groups praised the announcement, with the digital rights organization Fight for the Future calling it 'a big win for consumers [and] civil rights.” 
Chris Calabrese, vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, said , 'This rule represents a significant step forward in protecting internet users, who have no choice but to expose massive amounts of information to broadband providers. It reflects the reality that where we go online is private and the people we pay to carry it should treat it as private.” 
Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said the vote was 'a historic win for privacy and free expression and for the vitality of the internet. Just as telephone companies are not allowed to listen in to our calls or sell information about who we talk to, our internet providers shouldn't be allowed to monitor our internet usage for profit.” 
Still, he noted, 'The FCC's order is not airtight. We can expect the industry to try to exploit every crack in these protections, and hope that the spirit of vigorous oversight and consumer protection that has animated this proceeding will continue.” 
The racial justice group Color Of Change, which advocated for stronger privacy protections as a safeguard against data collection—which disproportionately affects communities of color—also welcomed the announcement. 
'When Color Of Change began their advocacy on behalf of communities of color, the FCC listened, and today ends the era of corporations having unfettered access to our personal data and information, which has been routinely used to take advantage of the vulnerable,” said the organization's campaign director Brandi Collins. 'Third party marketing and advertising entities can no longer shamelessly target and prey upon black people and communities of color. This ruling also takes a strong stance to eliminate schemes that require payment for data to be protected and safeguards our actions online.” 
Dallas Harris, policy fellow at the media democracy group Public Knowledge, said the decision 'marks a significant step forward in protecting consumer privacy. For the first time, [ISPs] will be required to get consumer consent prior to using the sensitive information they collect. While much remains to be done to protect consumers online writ large, the commission's rules establish a baseline level of protection for all.” 
'Thanks to the rules passed by the commission today, consumers now have more control over how their information is used online than ever before. Yet, consumer protection rules are only as strong as their ability to be enforced, so it is imperative that the commission follow these strong rules with strict enforcement,” Harris said. TAGS:

there were the wise men, a discreet gathering of corporate lawyers, diplomats and security strategists who advised President Johnson that the costs of Vietnam were greater than any of the benefits. .. . As The New York Times finally reported on Monday, April 24, the wise men are being recreated through the Iraq Study Group, funded by Congress, co-chaired by James Baker and Lee Hamilton, and including such power. 
It is funny how in this country it always comes down to economics and laws. I would think that in a true Democracy the will of the people would prevail but apparently we always need a group of wise men too. 
The protest marches, work stoppages, civil disobedience, will all contribute to the high cost of the war and as this group of wise men conducts the study our efforts will all factor in. 
It will cost us more in the long run should we become known as the country that tried to control all of the worlds resources (oil wells in Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia). The world will not think much of Democracy if we continue to invade countries based on fears of what might happen. 
Let the will of the people prevail.

Excellent post professor Hayden! I am glad to see you posting here where there is some substance to the blogs. Your article is full of news, information, and valuable insights I have not been able to find elsewhere. Thank you. 
So Scott Ritter is frustrated (already)! Oh, boy! I first heard about the horrors of the Vietnam war when I was 15 and still in High School. Many years later in my twenties I was still protesting the Vietnam war after seeing my friends Uncle burn himself on the steps of the Capitol building. 
As I recall certain peace activists were expressing concerns then too about one message being delivered by the peace movement (and the right message as well). I was told to shut up and let those that can deliver a consistent singular message do so. 
Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) split into two factions; the Progressive Labor Party and the Weathermen. But I believe it was the many different groups coming together in April and May of 1970 in Washington DC to March for peace that turned the tide of American opinion about Vietnam. I remember riding in a station wagon loaded down with 10 people that belonged to a Methodist minister and had no SDS people in it at all. Each person in that car had different reasons for marching but all came to protest the war. 
This weekend Tens of thousands of protesters marched Saturday through lower Manhattan to demand an immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. 
Everyone should continue to write to their Senators and congressmen but also participate in the marches if possible. 
The only points we have to agree on are these: 
1.Stop the war in Iraq 2.Tell Congress to cut off funding war. 3.No more preemptive strikes anywhere. 4.Bring the troops home now. 
All of this should fit nicely on the front and back of two signs. You carry one and your significant other carries the other one. 
We can talk about how we are going to turn the oil economy into an alternate energy economy later. What we have to do right now is stop the U.S. war machine from marching across the entire world stamping out potential threats. 
If you have to choose between dynamite and peace marches I hope you choose peace marches.

Generally speaking, I liked Tom Hyden's piece and would identify with most of its premise. However, I have and apprehension about any movement that would identify its agenda as against war; as if war is a necessary human condition we await to happen, then we mobilize to oppose it, hence the 'Anti-War Movement.” I want to be part of a movement that considers wars as the ultimate evil and the ultimate form of terrorism, which shoud be prevented with sound planned activism; but not wait to react to it after the fact of war is upon us. Further, I want to be part of a movement for true democracy; not a democracy that can be sold to the highest bidders, who will always be the members of the merchants of death, represnted by the military-industial complex. I want to be part of a genuinly fair and just democracy that leads the world by example; and not be led by the wims of special interest groups, such as the Israeli Lobby. I want to be part of a movement that have at its core philosophy that might is not right. I want to be part of a genuine humanistic movement that recognizes, with regret, that we 'are living at a tumultuous moment in a 500-year history of crusades, slavery, colonialism and patriarchy”, and we are going sincerely to make amends!

ETSpoon (1st reply in this thread) makes a good point about this war being fought by 'those who want to be there”. In Canada a fair bit of political hay is made of this we-want-to-be-there mentality by soldiers, especially after they've been killed. The media is usually filled with stories about the dead soldiers committment and their willingness to be at war. 
As in the US all Canadians are being cajoled to support our troops. Well, he fact is, as a taxpayer, I AM supporting Canada's troops, but against my will. 
Sometimes it feels like the only reason we're at war is so Canadian conservatives can use our involvement in Afghanistan as a pretext to spend a bunch of money (my money) on the military, something they've wanted to do for decades. 
I suggest that peace activists in both our countries start a tax revolt until a mechanism is in place that ensures supporters are the ones that foot the bill for the wars they want. This would certainly be in line with the long-touted user-pay principle that most war supporters inist on in virtually every other case where public monies are spent.

Thank you, Tom, for your percpective on the current state of the 'Peace Movement' and, by extension, the progressive radical movement in general. This really does seem to be 'the best of times and the worst of times.” The 'Peace Movement' has made a tremendous difference in keeping the issue of the Irag war from simply becoming part of the background noise of daily life. It does seem, however, to be struggling against an immensely powerful current of apathy and indifference. Progressive Radicalism too has helped to focus public attention, however fleetingly, on a broad array of pertinent issues. Still, the movement, as a whole, seems to have (d)evolved into a fractious multi- tude of cliques whose exclusionary ideological rigidity and seeming dependence on confrontational theatrics discourages committed involvement. 
In many ways this is no different than the conditions present during the 'Viet Nam' era. The 'Anti-War Movement' faced a tremendous uphill battle against public opinion and government repression. Other issues, when they were understood at all, faced reactions ranging from condesending amusement to violent hostility. Proponents of peace and other issues utilized an array of tactics ranging from reasoned discourse, to non-violent civil disobedience, to carnival antics, to paramilitary, guerrilla violence. 
Still, there are signigicant differences between then and now. For one thing, this is not all new. We've seen this type of thing before. Early in the Viet Nam war, those in opposition based their position on comprehensive pacifism and anti-imperialism. It took the revelations of Daniel Ellsberg and the release of the 'Pentagon Papers” to expose the general public to the mind set of the decision makers in the executive branch, the intelligence community, and the military, and to the lies, deceptions, and covert, provocative actions under- taken to involve the nation in a predetermined and unnecessary war. This time around, the charges of deception and fraud began before the war started and the evidense to support those charges followed on immediately. Public disillusionment has taken months not years. Let us see how this disillusionment translates into votes in the mid-term elections. 
Secondly, there is no draft as we knew it then. Young men of college age (women are still not required to register) are not currently faced with the life or death possiblity of being called to involuntary military service and probable combat duty. The disproportionate representation of minorities among combat casualties is also not a current factor. The 'backdoor draft' created by the deployment of National Guard units (to a degree unprecedented in history), the calling up of reservists (some of whom have been effectively out of the military for years), and the indefinite extension of tours of duty has temporarily filled the military's manpower needs. This has left the military to be viewed by many, if not most, as a volunteer force, serving in one sense or another by choice. It has also left the vast majority of otherwise draft elgible men free to pursue other options. This lack of direct personal involvement makes this particular population segment difficult to galvanize in to political action as they were during Viet Nam. It may well be the returning veterans of the Irag war, including significant numbers of women (some greviously wounded), who will form one of the most prominent segments of the current Anti-War Move- ment. Senator Kerry and other members of the Viet Nam Veterans Against the War, still active in politics and progressive causes, should cultivate this group with particular care. 
Third, the Anti-War Movement has thusfar avoided making some of the more egregiously boneheaded errors of the Viet Nam era. The labeling of common soldiers as 'baby killers”, the disrespect, mistreatment, and abuse of returning veterans, and the general indifference to their hardships and very existence by large portions of the Movement and general public have been largely avoided. The well intentioned, but utterly inappropriate, gestures of high-profile celeb- rities meeting with the leadership of opposing forces, visiting territories con- trolled by them, and touring their military facilities has also been avoided. Those mistakes continue to haunt the Peace Movement and have, in all like- lihood, contributed to the initial public support for the Bush administration's policies and reluctance to give credibility to those opposed to those policies. It is gratifying to see that the Peace Movement is able to learn from its errors even if this nation's leadership cannot. 
Fourth, while Congress possessed a solid and powerful cadre of leaders opposed to the Viet Nam war in the form of Senators Morse, Hatfield, McCarthy, Muskie, McGovern, and Kennedy as well as several members of the House of Representatives, it still took years to develop any significant oppo- sition to White House policy in Viet Nam. It was not until the release of the 'Pentagon Papers” that support for the war began to evaporate, and it was not until Watergate that political support for the Nixon administration disap- peared. Today there is a much broader base of opposition in the Congress and, after the initial acquiesence to President Bush's call to arms, that oppo- sition has coalesced and stood strong. It is only the minority status of the Democratic representatives and the iron grip of the Republican party over its members that is keeping all support from collapsing in the face of mounting evidence of fraud, deceipt, and the abuse of power by this administration. 
Finally, you may be right, Tom. The Movement has, in many ways, become 'mainstream'. Maybe the radicals are 'disappearing in the midst of their own success”. The array of issues that formed the great, broad umbrella of the 'Counter Culture' have spread widely throughout the society as a whole. Things that once appeared alien and outrageous have now become common- place. Ideas that once appeared to be held only by 'prophetic minorities” are now the intellectual property of anyone with the courage and independence to subscribe. This is, in part, a product of our 'information age' and it is a GOOD thing. 
It is good to see that some of you 'old hands' are still out there and speaking up, Tom. Your book, REUNION, Random House, New York, was quite infor- mative. With examples like you it will be easier for some of us to 'be winter soldiers in a long war,” and spread the 'Viet Nam Syndrome' everywhere.

Tony. I also voted for (financially supported and walked the streets too) for Kerry, but don't think I could do so again. 
Thought his 04' loss was caused by a variety of factors (republican fear and wedge strategy, corporate media complicity, national democratic party ineptitude, tactical vote suppression, et al) he must be held personally accountable for his incredibly off kilter campaign. 
It seems to me that some of the other possible candidates have gotten a clue on issues, bearing and process. Though I'm not ready to commit at this point, I'll certainly going to take a hard look at Gore, Edwards and Feingold for starters. 
I also think a self finanaced + netroots dark horse might emerge. Some not nutty millionaire / billionaire (like Ned Lamont's challenge to psuedo-dem Liberman in CT) could use his/her personal $$$$ to get a campaign jump started and then use internet financing to move beyond vanity. 
What do think?

'Sen. John Kerrys call for military withdrawal by the end of this year. Kerry stands a definite chance of filling the moral void in the present political process. When he steadfastly embraces his record as a young man, the message resonates in several ways.” 
I am a former member of John Kerry's Vietnam Vets Against the War. 
Oh, how I wish that John Kerry or someone from that era's anti-war movement would embrace their earlier principles. 
During his shameful presidential run Kerry ran away from his youthful principled stand against the Vietnam war. I kept waiting for him to resolutely defend his anti-war past. 
The only thing he has said recently that resonated with me was his referrence to how many men died so needlessly after it was clear there was no military solution in Vietnam. 
There is no military solution in Iraq!!! 
Men dieing there as we speak are dieing to salvage the political careers of Bush and company… and even Kerry if he doesn't take a stronger stand!

Hear, hear! My sentiments about Hillary exactly. Bill had his faults, but I've got much more respect for him than I do for her. Hell, she should have been there giving him blow jobs when he really needed it. 
I voted for Kerry. In spite of that travesty of a campaign he ran and all the shit I talked about him after the election, he still looks like the best prominent Democrat in the running. I could vote for him again if I had to, but not Hillary. 
As to Comment #7805 by ETSpoon, you are a damn fool. The peace movement is alive and well and succeeding. The last thing we need is naysayers like you. Why don't you get a job with the Bush Administration? That seems to be where your true sympathies lie.

Whether America accepts it or not it has lost the war in Iraq. 
As predicted by many the country has descended into Civil War. 
Now to add the folly of assaulting Iran will, in the words of the Editorial Writer of the Daily Times, 'see the region erupt in flames”. 
It is time for the American people to demand the return of the troops, demand a complete reassesment and retrenching of American foreign policy, to demand that American leaders address America's internal problems, to demand America's leaders abandon their desire to rule the world. 
And possibly, just possibly, return democracy to America.

Just as military leaders sometimes prepare to fight the wars of the past, political movements can become mired in views of the world that have been discredited. 
Certainly the absence of effective political oppostition to the war and any large demonstrations against the war is an indication that something is missing… 
Is it just a question of leadership, or has the country become conservative after all? If that is the reason, then political rants against the war will not make one bit of difference. 
The Anti War Movement can only dream of having mass demonstrations on the scale of the recent pro amnesty immigration protests. 
On the other hand there is nothing like loosing to make your point… 
When American's defeat in Iraq does come, America's political leaders will have a better understanding of the politic's of America's citizens.

The America SAD DENIAL Case 
Your war against Fear is not justified. It is actually a Resource War for oil, and a currency war for the dollar. Global Oil production has peaked and US will suffer the most from this crisis. The United States uses 25% of the worlds oil yet only has 5% of the worlds population. America is heavily in debt and bankruptcy is unavoidable. The coming housing bust will send the economy into a second greater depression. 
While the Middle East countries find themselves targets in the 'war on terror”, China, Russia, and Latin America find themselves targets in the recently declared and much more expansive 'war on tyranny.” Whereas the 'war on terror” is really a war for control of the world's oil reserves, this newly declared 'war on tyranny” is really a war for control of the world's oil distribution and transportation chokepoints. 
The dollar is in collapse, the economy is going to crash, oil is getting more scarce everyday. America is a nation that has its infrastructure built exclusively to be run on abundant cheap oil, with global demand of oil increasing exponentially and supply decreasing year after year, America has no other choice than to wage a global war on oil and currency and under the ruse of terror and freedom. 
What? No believe? You still denial?? 
Is your entire country on crack? Are all you Americans out of your cotton picking minds? Are you completely freaking delusional? Homicidal? Psychotic? Have you lost any shred of a moral compass? WHAT IN THE NAME OF JESUS H. CHRIST ON A CRUTCH IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE 
Let me offer up one small datum which may completely change the equation for you: According to the CIA (If they have any credibility left.) even accord to them Iran is at least five years away from a nuclear weapon. 
Five years. 
Five years is time for diplomacy to accomplish a hell of a lot. 
I would also point out that the Atomic Energy Commission, various other international bodies and other inspections have essentially found no sign that Iran is even working on a nuclear weapon. 
The only actual evidence that Iran has anything close to nuclear weapons technology is blueprints *that the CIA gave to them!* 
Have you all forgotten that the evidence on Iraq was spectacularly wrong? Have you all ignored the fact that it was fabricated? Why then are we going down the exact same road of stage managed, fabricated pseudo-evidence and wild-ass hysteria? 
What is wrong with you people? 
This entire crisis has been manufactured, and has been years in the making. 
Stop and think back five years. What did we have five years ago? A moderate reformist Iranian government making overtures to the United States, rebuilding its relationship with Europe, liberalizing its society, and modernizing its economy. 
Post 9/11 vigil in Iran. 9/11 comes along, the Iranians are overflowing with sympathy. Mass candlelit vigils are held in Tehran. Iran offers aid and cooperation. 
Iran hates the Taliban who have executed Iranian diplomats and massacred Afghan Shiites. Iran hates Saddam Hussein. Iran hates Al Qaeda which is a Sunni Fundamentalist organization which declares Shiites infidels and subhuman. 
Iran shares its intelligence with America - they even arrested Taliban members and handed them over to US custody. 
So we've got the Iranian spring; things are finally going to sort out. 
And what happens? The Bush administration rebuffs every Iranian overture and does its best to instigate a cold war. Afghanistan is invaded, and suddenly, the Iranians are looking at American troops and allies on their eastern border. Then Iraq is invaded, and American troops and allies on their western border. Then bases and treaties in Uzbekistan, and whoops, there's more American troops and allies on the northern border. The Persian Gulf is filled with American warships and carrier fleets. 
Now the Iranians are surrounded. And the tough talk is constant. Iran is part of the 'Axis of Evil' and Americans tell each other 'Baghdad, humph, real men go to Tehran.” Essentially, America has been threatening military action against Iran for the last five years, and has surrounded the country on every side with troops, bases and allies. 
American aircraft invade Iranian airspace regularly, American special forces undertake operations inside Iran and Americans regularly accuse Iranians of interference in Iraq. 
Dick Cheney pontificates about Israel bombing Iran *after he has just handed over to Israel the long range bombers and bunker busting bombs* required to do the job. 
Meanwhile, the United States undertakes economic warfare against Iran, interfering with its business dealings with third party countries, trying to scuttle a pipeline deal with India, and it goes on and on. The hysteria about the Iranians nuclear program is just more of the same. 
Now how in God's Bloody Name do you think the Iranians are going to respond to that. Should they concede the nuclear program, abandon their pipeline project? If so, its not going to do them any good. America will just seek more concessions. Each surrender will be met by new demands. This isn't hard to figure out. It's exactly what Bush did with Iraq. 
Perhaps overtures, good will gestures, trying to act like a peaceful nation. Did all those things, doesn't matter. The Bush administration is still on a collision course. 
So, the Mullahs are concerned that they're faced with a homicidal crazy state, the Iranian people are scared. When people are scared and faced with an aggressive warmongering power which keeps threatening to attack them, continually trespasses on its borders and is undertaking economic warfare… who the hell are they going to elect? Ahminajad may be a crazy bastard, but you assholes, you utter assholes did every thing you could to elect him short of donating 50,000 Diebold machines and mailing his party the trapdoor codes. 
So, having pursued a psychotically aggressive course, you've backed Iran into a corner, and engineered a regime which refuses to back further. 
And *you* are the victims in all this? *You* are the ones under threat? It's *self defense*???? 
And of course, you goofily believe that you can just bomb or nuke Iran with impunity? 
Holy microeconomic theory batman! Iran's nuclear facilities are distributed across the country and in hardened sites near population centers. So any strike that cripples a significant portion of Iran's nuclear capacity will inevitably be so large and kill so many people that its going to be tantamount to inviting full scale war. 
Think about that. Iran is 70 million people, an area five times the size of Iraq, not disemboweled by 12 years of sanctions and air raids. On the other side of the coin, America's ground army is busted and tied down in Iraq. There's no troops to throw at a major Iranian military force, so you have to hope that bombing will do the trick. The occupation forces in Iraq are in occupation and not territorial defense mode. And Iraq is 65% Shiites who are probably not going to be happy that you're blowing up their brother Shiites. 
Meanwhile, the Strait of Hormuz is so narrow that sinking one supertanker will block it indefinitely, and Iran borders the strait on three sides. Block Hormuz and any naval groups inside the Persian Gulf are trapped there. Any naval groups outside the Persian Gulf are trapped outside. Forget about any oil coming out of the Persian Gulf from Iraq, Kuwait, Quatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia or the UAE. Think about what that does to the price of oil, and to the world economy. Think about what that does to dependent countries like Japan, India, China and Europe. 
In short its so appallingly stupid and colossally risky, that I can see why your idiots in charge might consider using nuclear weapons. But throw a few nukes around and see how the rest of the world reacts? Every dirt-wad country is going to be mortgaging the Presidential palace to get its own nuclear deterrent from Pakistan or North Korea. How do you feel about the Indonesian Bomb, the Malaysian Bomb, the Thai Bomb, the Myanmar Bomb, the Algerian Bomb, the Saudi Bomb, the Egyptian Bomb, the Brazilian Bomb, the Argentine Bomb, the Venezuelan Bomb, the Cuban Bomb, the Japanese Bomb, the Canadian frigging Bomb. You are no longer trustworthy. North Korea, always borderline psychotic is going to be mondo difficult to deal with. You've just guaranteed yourself a full fledged nuclear arms race, balls to the wall with both Russia and China, and quite possibly Europe. 
And of course there's no guarantee that the rest of the world will allow this. Do you want an armed standoff with the Russians? Suppose they 'loan' their finest interceptor jets, pilots and radar systems to the Iranians… Do you want to meet *that* on a bombing raid? And if you do meet *that* what are you going to do when half your planes are blasted out of the skies conducting an illegal raid on civilian populations in a foreign country? Cry? Send a harsh note? 
Launch a first strike? 
World goes boom. What happens if the Chinese decide to hold Taiwan and South Korea hostage? What do you do? Back off Iran or sell out East Asia? 
Hell, in that kind of standoff, someone sneezes and its not going to matter who launched a first strike. 
Or would you like an economic standoff, say with Europe, or with Japan and China. Suppose that the Europeans or Chinese decide 'screw the worldwide depression, you assholes are just too dangerous to have around.” Trillions of dollars get dumped on the market, loans get called in, the bottom drops out of your dollar, its thousand per cent inflation and no manufacturing base and your own trade embargoes. So much for America. 
I mean, its morally wrong; its stupid on every level. And yet here you are discussing why maybe you should get out in front of the Republicans on this, or planning your surrender to Bush. Why are you even discussing this? 
What is wrong with America? 
Case in Iraq: 
Anyone here still remember the scam of Al Samoud 2? 
I totally forgot about it until today when I read that Iran has enriched a supply of uranium for the first time and Iran's president has said Iran won't back down ``one iota'' over its nuclear program. 
Remember when Saddam backed down? Its been so long even MY memory's been washed by Washington, but before the WMB bullshit we were hearing ranting and trash from Bush that it was because of Iraq's Al Samoud 2 missiles had 10 miles extra range than allowed by the UN [funny how US itself never follows UN regulations] that the US was going to attack Iraq. Al Samoud 2 was a big issue for a while, and Bush gave Saddam an ultimatum of a week or so to disarm and destroy all 90 some missiles or else the US EVIL EMPIRE was going to attack….

The 'P' in PBS Should Stand for 'Plutocratic' or 'Pentagon' Posted on Oct 27, 2016 ( WikiMedia ) 
In a television commercial that the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) ran for years, 'PBS NewsHour” host Gwen Ifill declared that she loved her job because it allowed her to 'ask not only all of my questions but also and more importantly all of your questions .” This assertion was and remains absurd, just like her network's regular fundraising claim to be free of corporate sponsors. 
The claim has long been contradicted by the string of corporate-image commercials (purchased by leading financial, defense, auto, insurance and rail corporations) that appear before the network's nightly 'NewsHour” broadcast—along with a list of corporate-sponsored foundations and superwealthy individuals who pay for the show, along with 'regular viewers like you.” 
Consistent with those commercials and despite its name, the news and commentary one finds on PBS is in rich tune with the narrow capitalist parameters of acceptable coverage and debate that typify the more fully and explicitly for-profit and commercialized corporate media. As progressive journalist David Sirota suggested two years ago , reflecting on recent investigations showing that supermoneyed, right-wing capitalists such as the Koch brothers and Texas billionaire John Arnold had (along with more liberal software mogul Bill Gates) influenced PBS content through multimillion-dollar donations, the 'P” in PBS often seems to more properly stand for 'Plutocratic,” not 'Public.”

None of this should be surprising to anyone familiar with the distinctively big-business-dominated history of U.S. broadcast media . Because the United States fails to provide anything like adequate funding for public broadcasting, both PBS and National Public Radio (a regular vehicle for neoliberal business ideology) depend upon foundations, corporations and wealthy individuals to pay for much of their programming. Beneath their standard claims to have no interest in shaping public media content, these private funders have bottom-line agendas, meaning that their contributions come with strings attached—strings that undermine the integrity of the 'independent” journalism they bankroll. (For what it's worth, between 1994 and 2014, the 'NewsHour” was primarily owned by the for-profit firm Liberty Media . Liberty Media was run by the conservative and politically active billionaire John Malone, who had a majority stake in MacNeil/Lehrer Productions, the show's producer.) 
The Pentagon Broadcasting System? 
What might seem more surprising, perhaps, is the remarkable extent to which the 'P” in PBS often seems to stand for 'Pentagon,” or perhaps 'Presidential,” when it comes to foreign policy content. Whatever the global issue of the day or week, 'NewsHour” anchors and their invited 'experts” can be counted on to report and reflect in accord with the doctrinal assumption that Washington always operates with the best of intentions. They almost uniformly treat the U.S. as a great, benevolent and indispensable force for freedom, democracy, security, peace and order in a dangerous world full of evil and deadly actors. 
The show's invited commentators are drawn primarily from the nation's imperial establishment. They are commonly current or retired insiders from within the Pentagon, the White House, the 'intelligence community” and/or the nation's elite network of foreign policy think tanks: the Council on Foreign Relations (the granddaddy of all U.S. ruling-class think tanks ), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Aspen Institute, the Atlantic Council, the Rand Corp. and the Hoover Institution, to name a handful. 'NewsHour” anchors and guests generally agree that the United States' officially designated enemies are malevolent bad guys who need to be contained, controlled and even attacked by the ultimate good guy, Uncle Sam. 
Not surprisingly, the long and ongoing record of U.S. imperial arrogance and criminality (more on that below) is swept down George Orwell's memory hole even as new entries are added to the ugly registry. When reported by the 'NewsHour,” horrific crimes committed by the U.S. military are always treated as well-intended mistakes. Along with the rest of the mainstream U.S. media, the 'NewsHour” 'insist[s] that Russia deliberately bombs hospitals, etc., whereas if we do it, it is, of course, an accident .” 
There's some room for disagreement between and among the show's invited experts—including the show's semi-loopy foreign policy authority, Margaret Warner—about specific U.S. foreign policy tactics, strategies and actions. There's no space for serious debate about the immorality, lawlessness or imperial nature of that policy. On the rare occasions 'NewsHour” anchors seem to challenge guests from the White House or Pentagon on foreign policy matters, it is generally to ask why the U.S. isn't going harder at the officially certified bad guys. 
America as Umpire, Not Empire 
The foreign policy coverage and commentary doesn't get much better in the documentary division of PBS. A recent documentary (first aired nationally last week) shown by PBS bears the risible title 'American Umpire”—an obvious World Series season play on what the filmmakers see as the preposterous notion of an American empire. It is narrated by ex-Marine and former 'NewsHour” host and producer Jim Lehrer. Developed by the right-wing Hoover Institution and 'targeted for PBS” (the organization's own revealing phrase), 'American Umpire” takes the doctrinal 'American exceptionalist,” U.S.-good-and-civilized-rest-of-world-dangerous-and-bad narrative to absurd lengths. 
It provides extensive 'expert” commentary from such former imperial operatives as Madeline Albright (the onetime U.S. secretary of state who led the charge to criminally bomb Serbia and who went on CBS' '60 Minutes” to say that the death of more than half a million Iraqi children killed by Washington-led 'economic sanctions” was 'a price worth paying” for the advance of U.S. foreign policy goals), Condoleezza Rice (George W. Bush's neoconservative national security adviser before and during the arch-criminal U.S. invasion of Iraq), Gen. Jim 'Mad Dog” Mattis (an Iraq invasion commander and a former chief of the U.S. Central Command, who two years ago told a San Diego audience that 'it's fun to shoot people”), George Schultz (the Reagan-era secretary of state who called the Sandinista government in Nicaragua 'a cancer in our own land mass” that must be 'cut out”) and Karl Eikenberry (a retired Army lieutenant general who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan 10 years ago). 
With further commentary from a handful of mostly conservative academicians—above all the nationalist Texas A&M historian Elizabeth Cobbs ( author of a book on which the documentary is based), 'American Umpire” portrays 20th and 21st century U.S. foreign policy as nothing more than a noble effort to selflessly provide welcome and fair rules and discipline on the rest of a childish, dangerous and reckless planet (think 'Lord of the Flies”) that lacks the exceptional historical experience bequeathed to U.S. leaders by the nation's far-seeing Founding Fathers. The only substantive criticism of U.S. foreign policy in 'American Umpire” is the complaint, voiced by numerous interview subjects, that America harms itself to the benefit of others (the Europeans above all) by taking upon its shoulders too much of the burden of benevolently policing the planet. We are just too good for our own good. 
Our Real Task 
There is not space here to discuss in responsible detail the epic historical deletions and distortions this narrative imposes. The omissions are staggering. They range from the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Filipinos resisting U.S. imperial invasion and occupation at the last century's outset to the restoration of de facto slavery in Haiti and the Dominican Republic after World War I; the unnecessary atom bombing of Hiroshima and, even worse, of Nagasaki (really the first shots of the Cold War ); the toppling of more than 50 governments by U.S. coups and invasions since the end of World War II; the liquidation of perhaps as many as 5 million Southeast Asians in the so-called Vietnam War between 1962 and 1975; the Cold War-era sponsorship of Third World fascism from Chile to South Africa and Indonesia; the attempted assassinations of Fidel Castro and numerous CIA-directed terror bombings in socialist Cuba; the near instigation of global thermonuclear war on at least three occasions; the development and sponsorship of Osama bin Laden and other radically arch-reactionary, jihadist Muslim, paramilitary forces to fight the Cold War against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan; the 'Highway of Death,” when U.S. warplanes engaged in an aerial traffic jam as they rushed to slaughter tens of thousands of surrendered Iraqi troops retreating from Iraq in 1991; the coordination and sponsorship of a mass-murderous civil war on peasants, workers and intellectuals (with a death toll well into the many hundreds of thousands) in Central America during the 1970s and 1980s; the disastrous U.S. invasion of Iraq (responsible for at least 1 million Iraqi deaths); the calamitous U.S. toppling of the Libyan Gadhafi regime; the calamitous destabilization of the Syrian regime; the U.S. funding and encouragement of civil war in central Africa; the enablement and protection of a vicious right-wing coup in Honduras in the spring and summer of 2009; the criminal U.S. global war of terror, replete with rampant 'targeted assassinations,” torture, illegal renditions, endless drone war and special-forces killing operations across the Muslim world and other places as well. 
'American Umpire” hides these horrific transgressions and the imperial calculations behind much of U.S. foreign policy past and present. As numerous key U.S. planning documents reveal over and over, the goal of that policy was to maintain and, if necessary, install governments that 'favor[ed] private investment of domestic and foreign capital, production for export, and the right to bring profits out of the country.” Given the United States' remarkable possession of half the world's capital after World War II, Washington elites had no doubt that U.S. investors and corporations would profit the most. Internally, the basic, selfish, national and imperial objectives were openly and candidly discussed. As the 'liberal” and 'dovish” imperialist, top State Department planner and key Cold War architect George F. Kennan explained in Policy Planning Study 23, a critical 1948 document: 'We have about 50% of the world's wealth, but only 6.3% of its population. … In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity. … To do so, we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day-dreaming. ... The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.” 
The necessity of dispensing with 'human rights” and other 'sentimental” and 'unreal objectives” was especially pressing in the 'global south.” Washington assigned the vast periphery of the world economic (capitalist) system—Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and the energy-rich and thus strategically hypersignificant Middle East—a less than flattering role. It was to 'fulfill its major function as a source of raw materials and a market” ( actual State Department language ) for the great industrial (capitalist) nations (excluding 'socialist” Russia and its satellites). It was to be exploited both for the benefit of U.S. corporations/investors and for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan as prosperous U.S. trading and investment partners organized on properly capitalist principles that were hostile to the Soviet bloc. 
'Democracy” was fine as a slogan and benevolent, idealistic-sounding mission statement when it came to marketing this core, underlying, ultra-imperialist U.S. policy at home and abroad. Because most people in the 'Third World” had no interest in neocolonial subordination and subscribed to what U.S. intelligence officials considered the heretical 'idea that government has direct responsibility for the welfare of its people” (what post-World War II U.S. planners called 'communism”), Washington's real-life commitment to popular governance abroad was strictly qualified, to say the least. 'Democracy” was suitable to the U.S. as long as its outcomes comported with the interests of U.S. investors/corporations and related U.S. geopolitical objectives. It had to be abandoned, undermined and/or crushed when it threatened those investors/corporations and the broader imperatives of business rule to any significant degree. As President Richard Nixon's coldblooded National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger explained in June 1970, three years before the U.S. sponsored a fascist coup that overthrew Chile's democratically elected leftist President Salvador Allende, 'I don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go Communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people.” 
The selfish imperial cynicism of U.S. foreign policy continues to this day, into the post-Cold War and post-9/11 era. As leading Dutch political scientists Bastiaann van Apeldoorn and Nana de Graaff write in their important new volume , 'American Grand Strategy and Corporate Elite Networks: The Open Door Since the End of the Cold War,” 'From the end of the 19th nineteenth century onward, American grand strategy has pursued a liberal expansionism aimed at the creation of a global hegemony premised upon open, 'free” markets, to which global capital—and, above all, U.S. transnational capital—has full access. … The global Open Door has continued to define the ends of the American grand strategy throughout the post-Cold War era.” Because—as during and before—the Cold War's end, Washington's commitment to 'democracy” and 'human rights” is conditional and hypocritical: The noble principles are fine insofar as they serve the free-market hegemony of global and especially U.S. transnational capital. They are dispensed with, even as U.S. policymakers trumpet them, when they do not.

The first two movements of the movie 'Moonlight,” Barry Jenkins' lyrical account of one young man's passage to adulthood, shatters the soul into sharp-edged shards. The third section of this unique triptych, Jenkins' adaptation of Tarell Alvin McCraney's play , 'In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue,” rearranges these fragments in a way that makes its characters—and viewers—whole. 
This coming-of-age story is all the more singular because it is a serious film by African-Americans, one that employs the familiar tropes of black poverty and underemployment, and yet defines its characters not by the struggle against the racism, drug addiction or incarceration that limit them, but by the humanity that elevates them. This distinguishes it from other compelling recent films such as '12 Years a Slave” and 'The Birth of a Nation,” which contend with the hopelessness of slavery. 
The place: the northwest Miami enclave of Liberty City . The time: the 1980s, perhaps not so long after white police officers have been acquitted of beating to death a black youth. One afternoon, Juan ( Mahershala Ali ), a dealer during this period when crack is replacing pot and heroin as the drug of choice, sees a small schoolboy running from his pursuers, who taunt each other to 'get his gay ass!” 
The undersize 9-year-old, Chiron (played by the watchful Alex Hibbert), takes cover in an abandoned building from which Juan extracts him. The older man takes Chiron to the modest home he shares with Teresa ( Janelle Monáe ). For those who know Hollywood movies, this is particularly fraught. Is Juan planning to recruit Chiron as a sex partner, a drug runner, or …? 
Juan is a dealer, but that's not all he is in this movie, which refuses to reduce characters to fit convenient pigeonholes. Juan is also a supremely empathic father figure who looks out for and protects this stripling. 
Still, for Chiron, nicknamed 'Little,” the world is a brutish place that diminishes people who are different. While at first Chiron is almost mute, after a meal he quietly asks Juan what the word 'faggot” means. 
Wisely, Juan blames Chiron's victimizers: ' 'Faggot' is a word used to make gay people feel bad,” he says. When Chiron asks, 'Am I one?” Juan shrugs and replies, 'You could be gay, but you don't got to let people call you a faggot.” Despite Juan's excellent advice, Chiron will let his mother ( Naomie Harris , in a devastating turn) and his baiting schoolmates call him just that. The only time Chiron is not on what appears to be emotional lockdown is with a schoolmate named Kevin, as outgoing as Chiron is introverted. 
Juan does not teach Chiron to fight back. Nor, in the calm blue waters off of Miami Beach, does the older man send the boy the message that life is a matter of sink or swim: He teaches Chiron to float. The moment Chiron ceases to navigate the world burdened with fear and humiliation and experiences zero gravity, his weightlessness is transcendent. 
On a moonlit evening when Chiron is a teenager (now played by wiry, wary Ashton Sanders), he finds himself on that same beach, silent but for the plash of gentle waves. While in most encounters Chiron retreats from others, this night he approaches Kevin. They talk. Another moment of ecstatic weightlessness. Another glance at the fluidity of masculinity. 
Though there are moments of violence and betrayal in 'Moonlight,” Jenkins quietly achieves something that more didactic filmmakers cannot. In this film, with minimal plot and dialogue, he brings his camera up close to his characters. Without telling us how to feel, he gives us the space to feel Chiron's inner thoughts. The result is a movie that, like the scene of Juan teaching Chiron how to float, is a baptism by hope.

Election's Rape And Sexual Assault Accusations Need to Be Taken Seriously Posted on Oct 27, 2016 
By Sonali Kolhatkar Protesters organized by the National Organization for Women gather near the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City on Oct. 12, as sexual assault allegations about GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump emerged on the heels of The Washington Post's bombshell report about Trump's 2005 'Access Hollywood” hot-mic comments regarding his treatment of women. (Frank Franklin II / AP Photo) 
Less than a day after the third and final 2016 presidential debate, GOP nominee Donald Trump faced new accusations from a woman who recounted a story of her sexual assault at his hands. Karena Virginia told members of the press how Trump groped her in public at the U.S. Open in 1998 while asking, 'Don't you know who I am?” 
Two days later, two more women, Kristin Anderson and Summer Zervos, made similar allegations . Earlier this year, a woman named Katie Johnson said Trump raped her in 1994 when she was 13 years old; she filed a lawsuit against him that was later thrown out on a technicality. Trump's ex-wife, Ivana Trump, has also accused him of raping her. To date a dozen women have publicly alleged that Trump in some way assaulted them. 
Jane Piper, an activist who faced her rapist in court in 2014 , told me in an interview that she believes the women who have accused Trump. 'I take their word as their word, and I believe them,” she said. 'We have this documented evidence of [Trump's] attitude and behavior toward women,” added Piper, referring to his numerous public statements revealing a callous and disrespectful attitude toward women. To Piper, the idea that Trump might be a serial perpetrator of sexual assault is consistent with his language and the attitude he has publicly displayed.

Think about Bill Cosby. While he has not been convicted on charges of sexual assault, in the court of public opinion, he is already considered guilty. He has admitted to drugging women in order to have sex with them, and the sheer volume of accusers against him leaves one wondering: 'How could they possibly all be lying?” As Fox News' Chris Wallace asked Trump during the final presidential debate, 'Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances, from so many different years, why would they all ... make up these stories?” 
Indeed, in cases such as those involving Cosby and Trump, there is little to be gained by publicly proclaiming oneself the victim of rape and assault. All a woman gains is to be forever known as someone who accused a famous man of a vile crime. According to Piper, 'It is not comfortable to be known in this way. It makes no sense, and it is ridiculous and offensive and insulting” to imply that a woman might make it all up for fame. 
Like Cosby, Trump has bragged about assaulting women. In a now infamous recording obtained by The Washington Post , Trump revealed to TV host Billy Bush that he simply has his way with women: 'Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.” And, as in Cosby's case, women are emerging from the woodwork as the election looms to reveal sordid stories about Trump's alleged assaults on them. 
One major difference here is that Cosby is an actor (who will indeed face the accusations against him in court), while Trump is running for the highest office in the nation. While all men, including Cosby, need to be held to high standards on sexual assault, those who run for president deserve the utmost scrutiny. 
Piper dismissed the response by Trump's supporters that the timing of the accusations now emerging is suspect. 'Of course, this timing is perfect,” she told me, 'because [Trump's accusers] just listened to him in that video describe what he did and [be] proud of it, and the next day, in the debate, lie and say that he never ever actually did that.” Piper said that if she had been one of the women who had alleged assault by Trump, she 'would be doing everything in my power to make sure that the public knew what kind of person this man was so that they would know what kind of leader they were choosing to elect.” Essentially, anyone running for president of the United States should expect his or her past and present to be scrutinized under the most stringent of microscopes. 
'Womanizing,” or having affairs, as presidential candidate Gary Hart was accused of in 1987, is very different from being accused of sexual assault or rape. Hart was brought down by a media frenzy that began with a single, provocative photograph. Trump is heading straight into an election dogged by repeated accusations of crimes—not affairs—and all he has offered are simplistic denials and deflections.

Josh Fox on Dakota Access Pipeline Standoff: 'Where the F*** Is Hillary Clinton Right Now?'   CREDIT 
Filmmaker Josh Fox has a pretty good idea where Hillary Clinton is likely to be found starting Jan. 20. But before she makes her final play for the White House, Fox has a pressing question for the Democratic  . 
'Where the fuck is Hillary Clinton right now?” Fox asked during his guest appearance on 'Live at Truthdig” at the site's Los Angeles headquarters. 
That was more of a pointed question than a literal one, since anyone with a television or smartphone can easily track down where Clinton is making her latest campaign stump speech. 
More specifically, Fox, who's a climate activist and playwright as well as the director of the Oscar-nominated documentary 'Gasland,” was wondering why Clinton wasn't anywhere near the contested grounds of North Dakota where the ongoing clash over the Dakota Access pipeline is reaching a volatile point. 
  
Remarking that 'we all want to think that we would be on the right side” of history and that, for example, 'if we were in Selma, we all would have marched with King,” Fox positioned Clinton squarely 'on the wrong side of history right now” for maintaining a conspicuous silence about the DAPL battle. 
'You cannot stand by when a racist occupying force that is run by the government of a rogue state is operating as an arm of the oil and gas industry, is attacking natives, is attacking protesters, is attacking people and torturing them in the ways that we saw in the Iraq War,” Fox said. 'It's unacceptable.” 
Fox was equally unsparing about Clinton's environmental credentials. 'Hillary Clinton is not an environmentalist,” he said. 'Hillary Clinton is not adequate on climate change. And right now, she's standing by while human rights abuses are unfolding in America where she's running for president.” 
The director was making the media rounds to drum up support for the activists and members   allied protesters in North Dakota, some of whom faced off Thursday with police in riot gear as law enforcement and National Guard personnel forcibly removed protesters from their encampment near one of the pipeline's construction zones. He was also putting out the word about the plight of fellow filmmaker Deia Schlosberg, producer of his 2016 documentary 'How to Let Go of the World (and Love All the Things Climate Can't Change),” who was arrested and hit with conspiracy charges earlier this month while shooting footage of activists at a North Dakota tar sands pipeline. Schlosberg has been charged with three felonies and may face 45 years in prison.

'We need to drop all the charges immediately, we need her footage back—her footage was confiscated,” Fox said of Schlosberg. 'We definitely need an outcry and an outpouring of support for our journalists who are facing jail time for doing what is a constitutionally protected activity.” Fox has posted a videotaped statement about his colleague's plight, as well as information about a petition, on this promotional site for his latest work. 
Despite his robust criticism of Clinton, Fox told Truthdig's Sarah Wesley, Emma Niles and Donald Kaufman that he was more concerned about the possibility of GOP nominee Donald Trump winning this election. Fox, who had supported Democratic candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and served on the Democratic platform committee at last summer's party convention, said he understood Sanders' reasons for backing the Democratic ticket: 'If Bernie Sanders' legacy was to contribute to the election of Donald Trump, I think his whole life would have been a failure.” 
As for Green Party   Jill Stein? 'I'm sorry. It's immoral what she's doing,” Fox said. 'And I don't care if I say this on air for the very first time—I spent eight years building the environmental movement, I spent eight years coast-to-coast building the [anti-]fracking movement, I went to 250 cities. I did not see the Green Party having a significant hand in the building of that movement.”

Starstruck and Party-Fanatic: The Moral Paradox of Trump Support Posted on Oct 28, 2016 
By Juan Cole / Informed Comment 
Donald J. Trump's poll numbers in California have cratered down to 28% . If he actually does that poorly in the election, he will set a record for poor performance of a presidential candidate in California. Ever. 
What is difficult to explain is why he isn't doing that poorly everywhere. Let's just review what Trump says he stands for: 
* Manhandling of women without their consent * Torture * Suggested that crime in Baltimore spiked because we have an African-American president * Jail time for women who have an abortion. * Reducing taxes paid by billionaires. * Stigmatizing Latinos as rapists and felons * Revival of the Ku Klux Klan without the sheets * Carpet-bombing civilian cities to get at ISIL * Unconstitutional treatment of US citizens of Muslim faith * Passage of political libel laws as a means to censor the press 
Most Americans are opposed to these planks of the Trump platform. So why is he still winning any states in the polls? 
I think there are two things going on here that give Trump a floor in many states that he does not have in California. Those two things are his celebrity status and blind party loyalty. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Trump is a celebrity of a sort we have never had run for president. Ronald Reagan, a B actor in his youth, was not in the same category. When Reagan ran for president in 1980 his acting days were long behind him and few people in the electorate cared about his old black and white films. Trump, in contrast, was on a popular reality show for 11 seasons and until just before he announced his run. Early in its run, the Apprentice got as many as 20 million viewers. It is true that the audience rapidly dropped thereafter, but nevertheless Trump was before millions of people a week. 
Most politicians have to spend time introducing themselves to the public. Most everybody knew who Trump was. I have a strong suspicion that this name recognition has inflated Trump's poll numbers in the generals. That is, there are a lot of Americans who don't follow politics. 42% of them don't bother to vote in a typical presidential election. Many of the rest aren't paying much attention until September and October just before Election Day. So in most years when pollsters call in August and ask people who they are voting for and name the two candidates, I think they probably get a lot of suspicious answers because some proportion of their sample has never heard of that person or can't describe what the candidate stands for. 
Not so in the case of Donald Trump. (Hillary Clinton, of course, also probably has high name recognition, but she hasn't been in people's living rooms the way Trump has. And no, I don't mean it that way.) 
Moreover, Americans are often forgiving of their celebrities' foibles. Celebrities are there to entertain us or offer us power fantasies, not to behave themselves. Los Angeles prosecutors notoriously have an uphill battle in getting jurors to convict even obviously guilty celebrities. Whereas Americans at least always used to be puritanical in their expectations of politicians, they are tolerant of moral lapses in the Hollywood set. Trump confuses many of them because he is both a celebrity and a politician, but many are more willing to be lenient with him than they likely would be with some lawyer they'd never heard of who was running for office. 
The other distorting variable here is party loyalty. Perhaps the rise of social media has cemented party polarization in the US. There were people in the old days who voted Clinton and then voted Bush (white Protestant women did so in droves). But party loyalty seems to have solidified with the rise of social media. Maybe it is embarrassing to switch sides in public when you've been involved in Twitter or Facebook slamming matches on behalf of the last party you voted for. 
A lot of Republicans are clearly clinging to Trump despite the Billy Bush tape and subsequent charges from the women he's groped. These include evangelicals and 'blue hairs' (the little old white ladies who are reliably Republican and usually morally censorious). Some 82% of self-identified Republican women are still supporting Trump, groping and all. 
So why is California different here? Well, in part it just no longer has many Republicans. About half of the some 40 million Californians are registered to vote. About 28.9 % of those registered voters are Republicans. So the party-loyalty distorting factor may still be at work there. But the GOP in California long ago tied itself to the declining white population (now a minority) and so suffered an implosion. National GOP policy and certainly that of Trump is making the same mistake, which is why they can't win national presidential elections any more. 
Second, Trump has lost many women independents , those famous 'soccer moms' who voted for Bill Clinton and then switched to W. 
So we should expect Trump everywhere to be getting about the same percentage support as the percentage of registered voters who are Republicans. Hence, he wins in Alabama. And he might even do a little better than that, gaining those independents (especially men) willing to wink at a celebrity's hi jinx if only he will get the Federal government off their backs and halt immigration. 
I usually don't hold people's votes against them on moral grounds. People make their own judgments in politics and there are good people in both parties. 
But I think there is a moral deficit in anyone still willing to vote for Trump, despite all the racism, fascism, sexism, and sexual predation. If our two-party system and our current modes of communication have led us to this place, it is time to rethink them. Otherwise the Republic is in danger. TAGS:

FBI Reopens Hillary Clinton Email Case After New Information Surfaces Posted on Oct 28, 2016 FBI Director James Comey testified on Capitol Hill in July and said the probe of Hillary Clinton's private email server was finished. ( Evan Vucci / AP ) 
The heat is back on Hillary Clinton. On Friday, the FBI told Congress that it is reviewing its investigation of her private email server after new emails emerged. 
According to The New York Times, the new information came from Anthony Wiener's electronic devices in an unrelated case. Wiener is the husband of Huma Abedin, one of Clinton's top aides. 
The latest developments could lead to the FBI reopening its criminal investigation into Clinton. 
In the letter to Congress, FBI Director James Comey stated: 
In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton's personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony. 
In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. 
Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committee about our efforts in light of my previous testimony. 
The Associated Press reported that the Clinton campaign and White House did not have any immediate comments . 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who believes Clinton set up a 'criminal scheme,” was happy with the news. 
'Perhaps finally justice will be done,” Trump said. 
State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the department would 'cooperate to the full extent that we can.” 
House Speaker Paul Ryan had little sympathy for Clinton and said she has 'nobody but herself to blame.” 
'She was entrusted with some of our nation's most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information,” Ryan, R-Wis., expressed in a statement. 'This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators. I renew my call for the Director of National Intelligence to suspend all classified briefings for Secretary Clinton until this matter is fully resolved.”

Millennials 'Search for Truth' on Election but Distrust Media, Intelligence Firm Reports Posted on Oct 28, 2016 A crowd of millennial voters at a South Bronx rally for Sen. Bernie Sanders in March. ( Michael Vadone / CC 2.0 ) 
Don't believe the hype about millennial voters. This bloc of the Unites States population, ages 18 to 35 and whose numbers are estimated to be about 69.2 million, may have a reputation for not engaging with the political system —but that is not the case for this election, The Intelligence Group reports, based on a recent study. 
'Leading up to the presidential election, millennials are taking advantage of their hacking mindset to create their own persuasion journey to get to the truth,” The Intelligence Group, a part of global marketing agency Deep Focus, which performs research for corporations and government organizations, states in a report that quotes numerous millennial voters. 
This subset of the electorate will play an important role at the ballot box, and its members are doing their homework. 
'The media is a joke,” said Joseph, 31, a moderate in the study. 'I research things much more. I Google the topic, and then I sift through a bunch of media spin to try and see if it's true or not.” 
The group's research, conducted through 'a blended approach of social listening and qualitative insights generated via real-time social conversations,” found millennials fact-checking the presidential candidates' assertions and engaging with their peers on social media sites and forums such as Reddit, Twitter and Facebook to 'make an informed opinion and hold candidates accountable.” 
During the first presidential debate, for example, The Intelligence Group reported that Americans posted 138,000 tweets to fact-check the candidates in real time. This eagerness to critically assess the candidates stems from a distrust of both media and the candidates themselves. 
'I don't believe there is such a thing as a truly objective source,” said Kelly, 25, a liberal. 'It's up to the individual to factor in the relative objectivity of a source when making their opinion.” 
The millennial vote is an increasingly significant one. This year, data show that millennials already match the baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) as the largest voting-age group in America, according to the Pew Research Center. Census Bureau data show that roughly 1 in 6 voters in the past two presidential elections were younger than 30. 
The presidential campaigns have taken note of these numbers, 'firing on all cylinders” to target millennials, according to Kristin Lynch, communications coordinator for the Clinton campaign in Denver. Clinton's team referred to social media and, specifically, Facebook Live, as crucial to reaching young voters. 
'[Trump] is really facing an uphill battle when people are only hearing what the media is saying,” Rachel Keane, the Trump campaign's Colorado millennial outreach co-chairwoman, told USA Today. 
In the 2012 election, President Obama won over millennials by a landslide against rival Mitt Romney, garnering 60 percent of the youth vote. 
'If millennials vote en masse, they have a chance to determine the election's outcome ,” writes Courtney Crowder of the Des Moines Register. 
The next big question is whether they will be motivated enough to actually vote.

The Green Party's Radical Common Sense Posted on Oct 28, 2016 
By Scott McLarty D. Ross Cameron / AP 
Germany and other European countries have a thriving multiparty political culture. The U.S. used to have one too. In 1916, five parties were seated in Congress. 
In his Washington Post article 'In Europe, the Green Party is a force. In the U.S., it's irrelevant. Here's why,” Per Urlaub, associate professor of German studies at the University of Texas, contends that 'the American electoral system is heavily weighted against small political parties.” 
He's right. Alternative parties must wrestle with ballot-access laws, enacted since 1916 by Democratic and Republican legislators in many states, that privilege major-party candidates and hinder others. In some states, alternative parties are effectively banned from participation. 
When alternative parties do get on the ballot, their candidates often face the 'spoiler” accusation. The supposed spoiler effect can be eliminated by replacing the prevailing 'first past the post” system with 'ranked choice,” which allows people to rank their preferences. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Reforms like ranked choice voting (RCV) and proportional representation—which gave Germany and other European countries their multiparty legislatures—are considered radical here, even though they grant voters greater power and more options. 
Greens have urged such reforms for years, but Democrats and Republicans prefer to maintain their exclusive hold. A chance for RCV in California died in early October with Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown's veto. 
The major parties solidified their grip in 1988, when the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) seized control of the debates from the League of Women Voters. Contrary to its 'nonpartisan” label, the CPD is run by Democratic and Republican representatives for the benefit of their own candidates. The League has called the CPD debates a 'fraud on the American voter.” 
The CPD adopted its poll-based criteria to determine participation in the debates after the 1998 gubernatorial election in Minnesota. Independent candidate Jesse Ventura was dismissed as 'not viable,” with a tiny percentage in the polls until he was allowed to participate in a debate. His poll numbers shot up and he went on to win. 
When the CPD witnessed what happened in Minnesota, it raised the requirement to 15 percent in the polls in 2000 to spare Al Gore and George W. Bush from facing Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan in the debates. 
The CPD's rules aren't meant to bar 'unviable” candidates, they're designed to keep alternative-party candidates from becoming viable. 
There's nothing inevitable about having only two parties. We don't have a two-party system, we have a two-party racket. 
Voters are aware they've been cheated. Their frustration is evident in polls showing they favor more options than two on Election Day, and the high disapproval ratings for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. 
Radical? Only in the U.S. 
Per Urlaub's main complaint about the U.S. Green Party is its 'radicalism.” In fact, the U.S. has a long history of radical alternative-party ideas. 
Abolition of slavery, women's suffrage, the eight-hour workday, worker benefits, public schools, unemployment compensation, the minimum wage, child labor laws, direct election of senators, Social Security, civil rights for blacks and other disenfranchised peoples—all were first represented in the electoral forum by alternative parties. 
Marginalization of minor parties in the late 20th century is an unmentioned reason for the shift to the right in both major parties and the disappearance of big progressive ideas. 
Obamacare isn't a big progressive idea. It's a repackaging of the conservative Heritage Foundation's individual mandate proposal and RomneyCare, implemented by then-governor Mitt Romney, a Republican, from Massachusetts. It was drafted by Democrats with the participation of insurance-industry representatives. 
Greens support a single-payer health care program, so that Americans can have the guaranteed medical care enjoyed by citizens of every other democratic developed nation. Only in the U.S. is universal health care dismissed as radical and unrealistic. 
Urlaub never mentions what makes the U.S. Green Party radical. He does, however, cite projects for conversion to clean, renewable energy that are implemented in Europe and advocated by presidential nominee Jill Stein and other Green candidates in the ' Green New Deal ,” which aims for freedom from fossil fuels by 2030. 
Global warming was nearly absent from the three Clinton-Trump debates, even after Hurricane Matthew pounded Haiti and the Southern states. 
Young people will live with the consequences of rule by two parties awash in corporate money and influence. Millennials face an era of deteriorating quality of life, increasing personal debt, exported jobs, eroded rights and freedoms, lawless militarism, and social breakdown as the planet heats up.

Inside 'Bill Clinton Inc.': Hacked Memo Shows Intersection of Clinton Profits and Charity Posted on Oct 28, 2016 
A 2011 memo from top Bill Clinton aide Douglas Band, published by WikiLeaks, details 'a circle of enrichment in which [Band] raised money for the Clinton Foundation from top-tier corporations such as Dow Chemical and Coca-Cola that were clients of his firm, Teneo, while pressing many of those same donors to provide personal income to the former president,” reports The Washington Post. 
The Post continues: 
The system has drawn scrutiny from Republicans [and progressives], who say it allowed corporations and other wealthy supporters to pay for entree to a popular former president and a onetime secretary of state who is now the Democratic presidential nominee. … 
The memo, made public Wednesday by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, lays out the aggressive strategy behind lining up the consulting contracts and paid speaking engagements for Bill Clinton that added tens of millions of dollars to the family's fortune, including during the years that Hillary Clinton led the State Department. It describes how Band helped run what he called 'Bill Clinton Inc.,” obtaining 'in-kind services for the President and his family — for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like.” 
Band grew close to Clinton during the '90s as his personal aide in the White House and became 'the architect of his post-presidential activities,” the Post reports. In the memo, Band argues that his work and the work of his firm benefited the former president and his family's foundation: 
'We have dedicated ourselves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities,” Band wrote. He added that he had 'sought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the foundation.” 
The Post continues: 
Band's memo provided data showing how much money each of Teneo's 20 clients at the time had given to the Clinton Foundation, how much they had paid Bill Clinton and, in some cases, how he or Kelly had personally forged the relationships that resulted in the payments. 
Band wrote that Teneo partners had raised in excess of $8 million for the foundation and $3 million in paid speaking fees for Bill Clinton. He said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out $66 million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place. 
For instance, Band wrote that Kelly arranged for the former president to meet the chief executive of Coca-Cola in January 2009 at the Clintons' home in Washington. In all, according to Band's memo, Coke had contributed $4.33 million to the foundation between 2004 and 2010. … 
Band also described how Kelly helped expand a fruitful relationship with UBS Global Wealth Management, introducing Bill Clinton to a top executive at a 2009 charity dinner. In the ensuing years, UBS upped its giving to the foundation, signed on as a Teneo client and agreed to pay Bill Clinton for speeches, Band wrote. 
Records show UBS paid Clinton about $2 million in speaking fees between 2011 and 2015 for a series of appearances, generally alongside former president George W. Bush. The company also paid Hillary Clinton $225,000 for a 2013 speech. … 
Another achievement cited by Band: Laureate International Universities, a chain of for-profit international colleges, which donated to the foundation and agreed to pay Bill Clinton $3.5 million a year to serve as honorary chancellor. 
Companies aligned with the Clinton Foundation paid several million dollars to Teneo for consulting services. The Post reports that a spike in payments from Dow 'raised red flags for an internal company fraud investigator, who expressed alarm that it may be linked to Bill Clinton's work with a charity founded by Liveris—a charge the company denied.” The investigator wrote: 'It appears Dow is paying Teneo for connections with Clinton.”

Invisible Nation: Homeless Families in America” A book by Richard Schweid 
About a quarter century ago, I taught a film course at UC San Diego. I drove from my home in Los Angeles once a week, returning the same day after my evening class. After one class session, some students requested to see me the next morning because they were unable to make my late afternoon office hours before class. I consented and stayed in San Diego that night. 
Failing to find any local friends at that hour, I looked for an inexpensive motel. The clerk at a relatively nearby dump stood behind a glass partition and handed me the room key after I paid the cash-only daily rate. He sternly informed me that no visitors were allowed. The room smelled of cigarettes and looked extremely unappealing. The carpet was filthy and deeply stained. I never removed my socks the entire night. The foul smelling bathroom sink was also stained. I slept fitfully on the threadbare, unwashed sheets and kept the bathroom light on all night. At 6 a.m., I rose and left, feeling as though I had been released from jail. 
Richard Schweid's remarkable and disconcerting new book, 'Invisible Nation: Homeless Families in America,” brought back my unpleasant San Diego motel memory. This exceptional work of journalism chronicles the lives of America's homeless families, focusing dramatically on the plight of the thousands of homeless children, many living for protracted periods in motels eerily similar to my dreadful San Diego 'fleabag.” Schweid traveled through a nation that privileged Americans generally try to avoid and deny. These more fortunate Americans are embarrassed, indifferent and sometimes actively hostile to the desperate plight of their hidden neighbors. Schweid's book is a compelling account of his findings. 
Throughout much of the 20th century, the homeless in America consisted primarily of men, often wandering from location to location. As late as 1980, families comprised only 1 percent of the homeless population. That number is now 37 percent, not only a huge increase, but a national catastrophe. Entire families now live in the streets, in cars, in temporary shelters, and often in one miserable motel room, waiting for some permanent relief in the form of a stable apartment. Schweid examined family homelessness in five U.S. cities: Nashville, Tennessee; Boston; Fairfax, Virginia; Portland, Oregon; and Trenton, New Jersey. He lived in the motels he described and listened carefully to the families' stories, the basis for his grim observations and conclusions. 
The accounts of family motel stays are the most dramatic feature of the book. Single mothers (and sometimes fathers) with one or more children are greeted by mildewed shower curtains, cigarette stains and lingering odors, cracked mirrors, stained rugs and sheets (often with holes) and other physical indignities, including roaches. Young boys and girls eat only what can be cooked in motel room microwaves and hot plates, often subsisting on the unhealthy fast food options from nearby restaurants and convenience stores. A lack of refrigerator space ensures that sugary beverages and precooked lunchmeats are common; fresh fruits and vegetables are rare or nonexistent in most of these motel settings. 
Especially in cold weather states, children can play only in motel corridors, often encountering unsavory residents and visitors with criminal and drug histories and involvements. The children usually wait in these corridors for buses to transport them to schools, which they change with devastating regularity as their families move from motels to shelters and other temporary housing facilities. 
All too regularly, families are evicted from these barely habitable motel rooms, invariably for not paying the (exorbitant) rent. Typically, they are locked out and lose their meager possessions. Schweid makes the point with heartbreaking poignancy: 'Children's toys and favorite things were gone forever. Anyone who has ever watched a young child form an attachment to some beat-up raggedy doll, some scrap of material ... will understand that its sudden overnight loss may generate terrible anxiety.” 
The results are distressingly predictable. Children residing in these motels (and shelters) frequently act out in school and perform poorly. Physically, they suffer from a multitude of ailments, including ear infections, asthma, skin disorders, dental decay, obesity, depression and many others. Some of these are serious and chronic, and can have lifelong detrimental effects. Failure to address childhood dental problems, for example, often leads to massive tooth loss, gastrointestinal disorders and emotional trauma, among other consequences. 
'Invisible Nation” also addresses the plight of homeless families in shelters, many run by local governments and sometimes assisted by churches and other charitable organizations. With minor variations, these shelters are the same in all five cities where Schweid conducted his investigations. The chief difference between shelters and motel rooms is that shelter food is generally better, and sanitary facilities like showers and toilets are generally superior. But privacy is conspicuously lacking, causing even greater stress to homeless parents and children. 
A debilitating feature of many of these shelters, moreover, is that their temporary inhabitants must exit the premises early in the morning, forcing them out to the mean urban streets. In Boston, Fairfax, Trenton and Nashville, they can face freezing winter temperatures, while in Portland, they can encounter relentless winter rains. The shelters also impose strict, even punitive rules and regulations, further oppressing the temporary residents. These settings are understandably places of last resort for homeless families, who often have no relatives or friends with whom they can stay.

Iraq's Skies Darken as Islamic State Torches Oil Posted on Oct 28, 2016 
By Kieran Cooke / Climate News Network Photo: Kuwait, 1991. Today, the Islamic State copies Saddam Hussein, threatening Iraq's environment with oil blazes. (Lt. Steve Gozzo USN via Wikimedia Commons) 
LONDON—Even at the height of the day, the skies in many parts of northern Iraq are dark as ISIS torches oil wells and oil-filled defensive trenches in its retreat. Artillery fire and bombing raids by US aircraft and others battling Isis are also causing conflagrations at oil installations. Aid teams near the town of Qayyarah, about 80 kilometres south of the Isis stronghold of Mosul, talk of escaping civilians being covered in oil residues . 'Everywhere is covered in a fine dusting of black soot and grime”, one aid worker from the Save the Children charity told the BBC. 'And the children we met were covered in it—their hands were black, their feet were black and their hair was matted…they were coming out in rashes, developing problems with their lungs.” Deliberate pollution There are fears that as ISIS comes under ever greater pressure it will unleash 'scorched earth” tactics, setting alight ever more oil wells and deliberately polluting the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates, two of the region's main rivers, which supply water and power to millions. Setting oil fields alight could also have wider climate-related consequences. During Saddam Hussein's invasion and subsequent retreat from Kuwait in 1990/91, the Iraqis set alight nearly 800 Kuwaiti oil wells: at one stage—in March 1991 – it was calculated that up to six million barrels of oil were being burned each day . The result was daytime darkness and long plumes of black smoke across a wide area of the Gulf. Though the long-term impact of Kuwait's oil fires on the climate is still being assessed, the release of vast amounts of climate-changing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is considered to have added to the problems of warming, on both a regional and a global scale. The Gulf region is one of the fastest-warming in the world, with many areas forecast to be uninhabitable in the not too distant future because of higher temperatures and chronic water shortages. Long-term damage Pollution from the Kuwait oil fires and ruptured oil pipelines are also believed to have caused serious long-term damage to the waters of the Gulf. There are fears that, with pressure on the group mounting, similar developments could unfold in northern Iraq as Isis torches oil installations 25 years later. In recent years Iraq has been trying to ramp up its oil production in order to raise more revenues—partly to fund the war against Isis. But much of the development of Iraq's fossil fuel resources has been badly planned and mismanaged . The World Bank says that, globally, approximately 140 billion cubic metres of natural gas produced together with oil are burned or flared off each year— adding 350 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere . 'From exploding fuel barrels to exposure to carcinogenic chemicals and inhalational toxins, these makeshift oil refineries will have a long-lasting health impact. ...” Iraq is now one of the world's leading gas-flaring countries: a lack of pipelines and infrastructure means that its gas is mostly burned off. Meanwhile the country has been forced to import large amounts of gas from neighbouring Iran in order to meet its energy needs. Across northern Iraq and eastern Syria—the country's main oil-producing region—Isis controls large numbers of oil wells and derives considerable income from selling fossil fuels on the black market . A lack of maintenance and expertise means that many of these installations are a hazard to the environment. Badly-run oil facilities also cause considerable human suffering. A recent report by Pax , a Netherlands-based church grouping, says that more than 5,700 makeshift oil refineries are operating in the ISIS-controlled Deir ez-Zor area of Syria. Thousands of civilians, many of them children, are forced to work at these crude, basically-run facilities. 'From exploding fuel barrels to exposure to carcinogenic chemicals and inhalational toxins, these makeshift oil refineries will have a long-lasting health impact on communities and their environment”, says the report.

By Padishah , July 23, 2006 at 12:19 am Link to this comment (Unregistered commenter) 
I must address the complete drivel that was Mr Jeff Gershoff's comment. 
First and foremost, in 2002, with the full backing of the Arab league, Saudi Arabia offered the Israeli's a peace treaty - I repeat - a peace treaty in the form of the Egyptian and Jordanian ones, stating the formal end to the Arab-Israeli conflict, recognition of Israel, and a whole host of other concessions in return for Israel returning all of the Occupied Territories captured during the 1967 war, and a just solution to the Palestinian humanitarian problem, amongst other concessions. 
Generalissimo Sharon outright refused to aknowledge this peace deal, and it withered. US Administration said nothing, the US media allowed the story to die. So your statement: 
'Let Hamas and Hezbolah recognize Israels right to exist and there can be peace. Let them keep strapping explosives to themselves and killing women and children, let them keep lobbing missles into Israel and Israel will continue doing what they are doing until one of them cannot get up off the canvas anymore.” 
is quite irrelevant, seeing as Hamas was not governing the Palestinian territories, and Hezbollah was not governing Lebanon in 2002. A general Peace deal with the Arab World was allowed to die, and you suggest that Israel will be willing to deal with two entities it thinks are terrorist organisations. 
Furthermore, you ask for the Arabs to make the first move. Always, the onus is on the Arab side to make many concessions even before Israel consider negotiation. There is no equal footing with which to negotiate with Israel because Israel will not allow it to be so. History and current events show that even if the Arabs were to accede to all Israeli demands, there is no gaurantee that the Israeli's will not find some other demand in order to stall, or even to not just ignore Arab overtures out of spite. Indeed, judging from recent events, they seem quite capable of it. 
Your statement: 
'No one gave a rats ass about the Palestinians when their home land was squalor, flies, and dirt. Israel turned it into a garden and now everyone demands Palestine for the Palestinians.” 
seems to imply that imprisonment in an Israeli garden; where your house can be demolished, or your olive and fruit groves be uprooted depending on your heritage, is much better than freedom in your own country, however squalid, fly-ridden or dirty. Furthermore, a land totally at peace would need no-one to give 'a rat's ass' (in your parlance) about it anyway, and is a misrepresentation of the historical situation. Your statement smacks of the colonialist attitude of the 19th and early 20th Centuries. Would you also hold this view for all those people of colour, who were enslaved and brutalised in many instances around the world? Would you believe that the sexual slavery of women practices in some parts of the world somehow beneficial to the women who must suffer those indignities? 
It's obvious from your comment that you harbour a prejudice for Palestinians in particular, and Arabs in general; they aren't fit for the land they occupy, and only Israeli's can make the Middle East bloom. Thus, by extension, all Arabs deserve to suffer under the heel of Zionism, for their own good. Corrrect? Does this sound eerily like the whole 'White Man's Burden' trollop that precipitated the excesses of the colonisation of Africa? It certainly does, and it fits with the Israeli mindset as well.

Israel likes to spy on the country that feeds it to the tune of billions to date and then calls the traitor who spied on us, a hero -just the kind of ally we need in the middle east. By the way, they also like to sell our military technologies even if we tell them not to - China sure appreciates it. Remember, do not forget the USS Liberty. Some Brits certainly remember that these same Israelis that cry holy terror about terrorism were terrorists themselves when the Brits were in Palestine and they to this day are unrepentant for the terrorist acts they performed.

Wow Jew Haters Gone Wild said: 
Jews have contributed their energy, intellect, resources to every progressive cause in modern history. And yet you so-called progressives just turn your back, raise the chorus of Jew blame, and think youre moral? [....] 
Well, yeah, I guess. In some ways, I think it could be argued that the Navajo have done far more. 
But the power-mad neozionists that have hijacked the Nation of Israel have been treating all their neighbors worse than cockroaches for decades. And they have warped, probably wrecked our American society in the process. They collaborated with the vicious apartheid Union of South Africa to enable the South African tyrants and themselves to develop nuclear WMDs. So that just doesn't make me feel friendly toward neozionists. 
As far as the question of weather I harbor any actual hatred of Jewish people themselves, you will never begin to be able to discover the answer to that. I could easily bear the fervent wish that every Jew be burned alive in an oven, all the while pretending to love the Jews. Or I could accept Jews as just people who practice a particular religion, bearing no ill-will at all against them, while proclaiming to Jew-hating neighbors that I detest the Jews as much as they do. But you will never be able to begin to decipher what I truly feel.

To plunger, message # 14774 
You piece on 9/11 is well reasoned and makes a lot of sense, and I thank you much for your interst in digging out the truth about this very tragic event and its far-reaching disastrous consequences on the whole world. 
There is no hope of finding physical evidence to prove who and how it all happened. This is so for the simple fact that the sophisticated team that planned this inside job made sure to destroy any physical evidence possible. 
In light of this, serious thinkers are only left to use their intellectual reasoning and circumstantial evidence to reach an approximation about the facts related to 9/11. 
Yours is indeed a very serious analysis, and, most likely, very close to the truth. That's why I was intrigued by your piece. I was particulary intrigued about your being specific on the Mossad role as a way to blackmail the political establishment. Remember Monica Lewinsky? I theorized, at the time, and wrote about her being an Israeli Mossad agent, planted in the White House to bring about the fall of Clinton, who was getting a little bit sympathysing to solving the Palestinian problem. 
Your piece also supports my thinking about 9/11; about which I wrote a short comment somewhere else on the truthdig. In case you have not read my piece, I am attaching it below: 
'To Janice A. # 14474: 
Youre very smart Janice. Youre one of the few thousands in America and around the world who believe 9/11 was an inside evil job, to create the atmosphere of fear in preparation for the trauma and mind control you talked about. 
I simply could not believe and will never believe that some people living in caves and constantly on the run could have carried out such sophisticated operation. This is not to say that Al-Qaeda had not enough hate for America to attempt hurting it in a big way when they could; but from a scientific point of view, know-how and sophisticated human resources, they did not have that, and no small group of enemies will ever have what it takes to prepare and carry out such operation. And imagine that!! The hijackers had only box-cutters as their weapons! From all those on board the hijacked planes, wasnt there a few courageous enough who were willing to get injured and possibly die to prevent a bigger disaster?!! 
Elements in the Pentagon, CIA, FBI with possibly a lot of help from the Israeli Mossad must have started working on this just as Bush was put on the throne by the Supreme Court! For Bush and the Neocons to continue ruling the country and taking it in the direction they have taken it, something tragically big must have to take place! Everyone knows, that in every country and society there is that class of people called the merchants of death! For what happened in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and now Lebanon, 9/11 was a must prerequisite! 
Sad as it is to invoke thoughts about the 9/11, I always find consolation to find like-minded people. Thank you Janice for being a free thinker and publicly join the small but privileged group!”

By the way: if Americans generally ever finally start to figure out what a false ally Israel really is, there is of course the danger of an upwelling of anti-Semitism in America. Let's look at exactly why this is so. 
The essential misunderstanding that may lead to such a horrible development is a failure of Americans to distinguish between Israel and 'the Jews”. This is a conflation that Israel and many American Jewish leaders have done much to encourage. 
Any strong condemnation of Israel's actions, of its ethnocratic ideology, or of its interference in our political process, is regularly condemned as inherently 'anti-Semitic” by prominent members of the mainstream American Jewish community. Right-wing American Christians  perhaps even more extreme than American Jews in their adherence to the notion of Israel's blameless holiness  eagerly echo this charge. 
And so, despite the fact that American Jews are in fact over-represented among intellectuals and activists who expose and denounce the crimes of the state of Israel, we may well see such a surge of anti-Semitic backlash in this country, if and when most Americans come to some glimmer of understanding concerning the worse-than-useless US/Israeli 'alliance”. 
Americans in general are not terribly sophisticated. This is why such a ludicrously one-sided alliance, so destructive to American interests, was ever possible in the first place. And it's why an anti-Semitic reaction may accompany its end. 
If this backlash should happen, then to Israel and to the American Jews who have laid the foundation for it, I have three words from a great Jewish philosopher: AS YE SEW.

Wow, just read this thing and be amazed at the level of knee jerk jew hating, blindness to history, and desire for the death of Israel. So sad. If these terror groups lay down their weapons and agreed to stop attacking Israel tomorrow, that would be the end of war. If Israel lay down their weapons and agreed to stop hitting back at the terror groups, it would be overrun tomorrow and a new holocaust would ensue. Apparently, that suits the jew haters just fine. Islamic fascism is fascism, and again Jews stand against it while the moral ambivalence or antisemitism of non Jews seeks to guarantee yet another cycle of jew killing. SHAME, SHAME. It's sad that Israel's only friend can be found in the Bush government, but that doesn't make ISrael complicit in anything that Bush does. If you have only one friend and you're fighting for your life, you don't question that friendship. More power to Israel in this fight for their life. Look at the numbers of arabs killed by arabs, of non muslims killed by muslims, of the track record of muslims in the world today (whereever there's trouble, muslims are there trying to dominate and destroy non muslims). Jews have contributed their energy, intellect, resources to every progressive cause in modern history. And yet you so-called progressives just turn your back, raise the chorus of jew blame, and think you're moral? You better hope that in the end we don't all get what we deserve.

I surely didn't say anything about Jews crucifying anyone… 
HOWEVER crucifiction was hardly exclusively a 'Roman thing” 
This means of punishment was practiced by Persians, Seleucids, Jews, Carthaginians, among others. There is even some evidence it was practiced in Egypt. 
reflex action? by whom?

Marcia, of course Ishrael wants peace…..a piece of Iraq, a piece of Iran, a piece of Syria and a piece of lebanon. They also have our own government by the balls through, bribery, extortion and threats. I and thouroughly disgusted and sick to my stomach from it all. It is time for a new American revolution. We must: Take our government back from those who have corrupted it for their own benefit, including Ishrael. Prosecute those within the Whore House for betraying our nation, our constitution and its people. The punishment must be severe enough to deter any who might think about doing it again in the future. Stop paying tribute to that miserable little zionist state. No more money period! enough is enough, goddamn it! Congress should get its collective asses kicked, and maybe in the balls as well. Break all ties with Ishrael..they are on their own from now on. That way they will have to behave themselves. As long as they have the U.S. as their rich poodle Ishrael will continue to act like a pitbull. Round up the zionists, MOSSAD, AIPAC and the jew lobby and send them packing back to zionland. Use the laws we have to break up the jewish stranglehold on our media, including the newspapers. There are enough anti monopoly laws with which to use. Please realise I have nothing against people of Judaism. It's the rabid, racist, zionist who I find to be our own worst enemy. Thank you Tom, for finally coming out with enough guts and patriotism to speak out on this matter. Even our founding fathers spoke out against zionism. Unless we change the course of our nation, we will be 'undone”. I fear for my country and for those in the middle east for they are the ones who are the victims of zionist aggression. Now I will wait for the zionists to send their hitmen to my house.

Harry, 
Crucifiction was a Roman thing. Jews have often been on the receiving end of brutality. Whether they have more often been teachers of brutality or learners from brutality can be disputed. That they have killed more Arabs in the last 60 years than Arabs have killed Jews in that same time period cannot be disputed. The side that the United States has taken in the disagreement cannot be disputed. It was interesting to see your reflex action.

This article has pushed me beyond some point of critical mass. My world-view will never be the same. 
What we are looking at here goes beyond issues like anti- Jewish sentiment, terrorism, capitalism, etc, etc, etc. We have been victims to a vast media conspiracy that has parlayed a typical religious ideal into a powerful, violent cult of death, and allowed that cult to play a key role in the establishment of a fascist regime in the United States. It needs to be called the neocon/ neomedia/ neozionist conspiracy of treason, or something like that. 
These pseudo- religious traitriots are destroying America and the rest of the world too, including the people of the Middle East, including the Jewish ones, apparently for sport. This is evil in its purest form. I am stunned.

John; 
Back when crucifiction was occuring in the Middle East the Brits were drawing and quartering folks, the Spanish were killing witches and most of Europe was pre civilized. 
I will not be a party to a conversation where we blame one side or the other for this disagreement which clearly has enough blame to cover the northern hemisphere. 
I thought the point of Tom's message was that there are two valid points of view here?

ARTICLE

( D. Ross Cameron / AP ) 
Let's all give thanks to Truthdig for enlightening us about the political views of Josh Fox, environmental activist and filmmaker. When Fox was asked in a filmed interview with Truthdig to give his view of presidential nominee Jill Stein and the Green Party, he said: 
I'm sorry. It's immoral what she's doing. And I don't care if I say this on air for the very first time—I spent eight years building the environmental movement, I spent eight years coast-to-coast building the [anti-]fracking movement, I went to 250 cities. I did not see the Green Party having a significant hand in the building of that movement. 
Fox is still blaming activist Ralph Nader for Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore's loss to Republican George W. Bush in 2000. No matter how often people like Fox get the math and history wrong, they continue to take the easy exit from reality. They always seem to forget that Gore was a lousy candidate who did not even win his own home state, despite all the deep funds of his chosen corporate party. If they really cared about a strong foundation for democracy, the partisan Democrats would campaign in earnest for public financing of elections and ranked choice voting . The latter reform alone would take away the argument that opposition parties and candidates are simply 'spoilers” of elections. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Fox claims to make a realistic case for 'strategy,” but he is only repeating the talking points of the career politicians and hired apparatchiks of the Democratic Party—including the 'news” from sites such as The Daily Beast claiming that Stein's portfolio is tainted by the circulation of capital in oil and other capitalist industries. 
In arguing against the purity of the Greens—which is, after all, very easily proved—Fox ends up arguing for an absurd standard of political morality. By such a standard, all of us must first become saints or professional revolutionaries before opposing the anti-democratic corporate parties. Stein, like many people, is looking for ethical ways to save and invest money. She is certainly upper-middle class, and in global terms decidedly among the rich. But by ruling-class ranking she does not rank at all. Money remains money and does not circulate simply by the dictates of our wills. 
By the very standard of choosing 'the lesser of two evils,” which Fox otherwise insists is the decisive choice between presidential nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, we might also choose to compare the wealth and portfolio of Stein with the Clintons'—including the 'philanthropic” Clinton Foundation. Or is this comparison ruled out of order if we refuse to vote for the candidate (and party) of Fox's choice? 
Fox also claims the Green Party only 'shows up every four years” to run a presidential campaign, without building the base and winning local offices in the meantime. False, as the public record shows. But it is surely true that the Greens can't compete fairly in big elections without a fair share of federal funds, so gaining the threshold 5 percent of votes in the general election would be a net gain for liberty and democracy. Fox sees that percentage result only as a gift to Trump in this election, and thus argues in effect that democracy is too dangerous if we must count votes against both Republicans and Democrats. He takes no responsibility for the downward spiral of retrograde bipartisan candidates in every presidential election, though the party of his choice is one of the big reasons for the erosion of voter turnout. [Editor's note: Jill Stein writes: 'Just 5 percent of the national vote for the Green Party Stein/Baraka ticket can be a true game-changer for American politics. It will qualify the Green Party for recognition as an official national party, and for federal funding in the 2020 presidential race proportional to the amount of votes received—at least $8 million to $10 million. It would also secure ballot access in a number of states that automatically grant ballot status if the presidential candidate receives anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the vote (varying by state).”] 
Activists in the Green Party have been in the trenches of environmental struggles far longer than the 'eight years” Fox spent in the anti-fracking movement. So if Fox is not aware of Green organizers and activists, either he is genuinely ignorant or he is a partisan propagandist. 
Fox's alliance with Our Revolution, Bernie Sanders' new movement, means he followed Sanders right back into the Democratic Party. Despite all of the friendly attempts by Stein to communicate directly with the Sanders camp, he chose not to cross a public and open bridge of communication. And indeed, though Stein and Sanders agree on many issues, an abiding contradiction separates the Green Party from the Democratic Party. As Stein has noted, you can't advance a political revolution within a counterrevolutionary party . 
Fox says he'd be glad to support various local Green candidates, but he calls Stein 'immoral” for daring to run as a Green presidential candidate. In fact, a presidential campaign is one way to raise funds and awareness of the state and local Green candidates Fox claims he would like to support. Fox is in no position to be giving 'strategic” advice to the Green Party, since he is not yet ready to make both a moral and strategic break from the Democratic Party. 
The Green New Deal is a practical program for peace, economic democracy and ecological sanity. A political revolution begins, morally and strategically, with the power of we, the people. Every day of our lives. Including election days. TAGS:

Cast Your Vote: Whose Foreign Policy Position Do You Prefer? Posted on Oct 28, 2016 Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton argued over foreign policy during the third presidential debate. (Screen shot via YouTube ) 
We are only 10 days away from Election Day, and the two mainstream candidates are steamrolling through the swing states in an effort to court votes. Over the past week, WikiLeaks provided some revelations on how Clinton and her husband used the Clinton Foundation to their advantage. Donald Trump, meanwhile, continued to close in on Clinton in the polls. 
The week began on a somber note, when news broke that longtime peace activist and California legislator Tom Hayden died at age 76. His original Truthdig reports , which have been reposted throughout the week, reinforce the importance of an anti-war foreign policy. 'Our systems—politics, media, culture—are totally out of balance today because of our collective refusal to admit that the Vietnam War was wrong and that the peace movement was right,” he said in 2016 . 
Many of his reports written back in 2006 focus on American foreign policy in the Middle East. Although written over a decade ago, Hayden's words of caution still ring true, as in this piece on a potential U.S. withdrawal from Iraq : 
Many activists are learning for the first time, or perhaps all over again, what it means to be winter soldiers in a long war. All the wasted lives can never be brought back, all those squandered tax dollars will never be redistributed, true enough. But if the war itself was never going to be a cakewalk, why should ending it be any different? It may still be far from over, with the simmering question of Iran on the immediate horizon. 
As Hayden warned, U.S. involvement in the Middle East is far from over, and throughout this election season a new player has entered the arena: Russia. 
Earlier this week, Trump stated that Clinton, if elected, would cause World War III with Russia. Truthdig contributor Juan Cole argued that '[s]uperpowers don't fight one another in the nuclear age…[they] fight proxy wars like Vietnam and Afghanistan.” Cole asserts that Clinton's experience as secretary of state will make it easy for her to communicate with the Russian government and the Pentagon alike. 
Others, however, don't feel too positive about a potential Clinton administration's foreign policy. Clinton has proposed a 'no-fly” zone over Syria as part of her foreign policy plan, alarming security experts . 
As Lauren McCauley writes, reports also surfaced this week showing how a Clinton administration 'will likely usher in a more aggressive, bipartisan foreign policy in the Middle East and beyond.” She quotes Greg Jaffe: 
The Republicans and Democrats who make up the foreign policy elite are laying the groundwork for a more assertive American foreign policy via a flurry of reports shaped by officials who are likely to play senior roles in a potential Clinton White House,” the Washington Post's White House correspondent Greg Jaffe reports. 
One such study, published Wednesday by the Center for American Progress (CAP)—which is run by president Neera Tanden, policy director for Clinton's presidential campaign—recommends the next administration step up its 'military engagement” amid a more 'proactive and long-term approach to the Middle East.” 
But what of Trump's foreign policy? Juan Cole also argued earlier this week that when it comes to Trump's assertions on the U.S. presence in the Middle East, 'he doesn't have the slightest idea of what he is talking about.” 
Truthdig's own Bill Boyarsky expressed a similar concern in his column this week, labeling Trump 'a threat to democracy.” 
'Trump's scorn for the electoral system and democratic institutions is reason enough to fear a Trump presidency,” Boyarsky writes. 'Added to that is his racist rabble-rousing against Muslims, those of Mexican descent and other immigrants.” 
And of course, the discussion on foreign policy doesn't solely revolve around just two presidential nominees. This week, NATO urged 'all allies to deploy more troops and military equipment to Russia's borders” in a move that Common Dreams staff writer Nika Knight called 'shortsighted.” 
There is also an inherent problem with the American military spending, says William D. Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. 'Through good times and bad, regardless of what's actually happening in the world, one thing is certain: in the long run, the Pentagon budget won't go down,” he writes. 'As long as fear, greed, and hubris are the dominant factors driving Pentagon spending, no matter who is in the White House, substantial and enduring budget reductions are essentially inconceivable.” 
So although there are broader, deeply embedded institutional factors responsible for American foreign policy, whoever wins on November 8 will certainly make an impact. Given the events of the past week—the focus on increased tensions with Russia, and the tightening race between Clinton and Trump—we turn to you, our readers. Which candidate has a foreign policy position worth pursuing? Will Clinton's experience, although 'war hawkish,” serve in her favor, or will Trump's business acumen serve him better as Commander in Chief? 
Let us know in the poll below. One vote per person, please. (Make your selection and then click on 'Vote.” To see results of the polling, click on 'Results.”) Which presidential nominee's foreign policy position do you prefer? Hillary Clinton

Facebook Lets Advertisers Exclude Users by Race Posted on Oct 29, 2016 
By Julia Angwin and Terry Parris Jr. / ProPublica David Sleight / ProPublica 
Imagine if, during the Jim Crow era, a newspaper offered advertisers the option of placing ads only in copies that went to white readers. 
That's basically what Facebook is doing nowadays. 
The ubiquitous social network not only allows advertisers to target users by their interests or background, it also gives advertisers the ability to exclude specific groups it calls 'Ethnic Affinities.” Ads that exclude people based on race, gender and other sensitive factors are prohibited by federal law in housing and employment. 
Here is a screenshot of an ad we purchased in Facebook's housing categories via the company's advertising portal : 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
The ad we purchased was targeted to Facebook members who were house hunting and excluded anyone with an 'affinity” for African-American, Asian-American or Hispanic people. ( Here's the ad itself .) 
When we showed Facebook's racial exclusion options to a prominent civil rights lawyer John Relman , he gasped and said, 'This is horrifying. This is massively illegal. This is about as blatant a violation of the federal Fair Housing Act as one can find.” 
The Fair Housing Act of 1968 makes it illegal 'to make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.” Violators can face tens of thousands of dollars in fines . 
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 also prohibits the 'printing or publication of notices or advertisements indicating prohibited preference, limitation, specification or discrimination” in employment recruitment. 
Facebook's business model is based on allowing advertisers to target specific groups — or, apparently to exclude specific groups — using huge reams of personal data the company has collected about its users. Facebook's microtargeting is particularly helpful for advertisers looking to reach niche audiences, such as swing-state voters concerned about climate change. ProPublica recently offered a tool allowing users to see how Facebook is categorizing them . We found nearly 50,000 unique categories in which Facebook places its users. 
Facebook says its policies prohibit advertisers from using the targeting options for discrimination, harassment, disparagement or predatory advertising practices. 
'We take a strong stand against advertisers misusing our platform: Our policies prohibit using our targeting options to discriminate, and they require compliance with the law,” said Steve Satterfield, privacy and public policy manager at Facebook. 'We take prompt enforcement action when we determine that ads violate our policies.” 
Satterfield said it's important for advertisers to have the ability to both include and exclude groups as they test how their marketing performs. For instance, he said, an advertiser 'might run one campaign in English that excludes the Hispanic affinity group to see how well the campaign performs against running that ad campaign in Spanish. This is a common practice in the industry.” 
He said Facebook began offering the 'Ethnic Affinity” categories within the past two years as part of a 'multicultural advertising” effort. 
Satterfield added that the 'Ethnic Affinity” is not the same as race — which Facebook does not ask its members about. Facebook assigns members an 'Ethnic Affinity” based on pages and posts they have liked or engaged with on Facebook. 
When we asked why 'Ethnic Affinity” was included in the 'Demographics” category of its ad-targeting tool if it's not a representation of demographics, Facebook responded that it plans to move 'Ethnic Affinity” to another section. 
Facebook declined to answer questions about why our housing-categories ad excluding minority groups was approved 15 minutes after we placed the order. 
By comparison, consider the advertising controls that the New York Times has put in place to prevent discriminatory housing ads. After the newspaper was successfully sued under the Fair Housing Act in 1989, it agreed to review ads for potentially discriminatory content before accepting them for publication. 
Steph Jespersen, the Times' director of advertising acceptability, said that the company's staff runs automated programs to make sure that ads that contain discriminatory phrases such as 'whites only” and 'no kids” are rejected. 
The Times' automated program also highlights ads that contain potentially discriminatory code words such as 'near churches” or 'close to a country club.” Humans then review those ads before they can be approved. 
Jespersen said the Times also rejects housing ads that contain photographs of too many white people. The people in the ads must represent the diversity of the population of New York, and if they don't, he says he will call up the advertiser and ask them to submit an ad with a more diverse lineup of models. 
But, Jespersen said, these days most advertisers know not to submit discriminatory ads: 'I haven't seen an ad with 'whites only' for a long time.” 
Clarification, Oct. 28, 2016: We've updated the story to explain more clearly that the ad we bought was not for housing itself — it was placed in Facebook's housing categories.

$19 Photo of the Week: President Who Let Citigroup Staff His Cabinet Calls for Solidarity From Voters Posted on Oct 29, 2016 President Obama waves to supporters in Orlando, Fla., Friday. (Phelan M. Ebenhack / AP) 
Every week, Truthdig's editors seek to present an image that singularly renders the world's trouble, triumph or toil. 
'You have a chance to shape history,” President Obama told a crowd of 9,000 people at a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton in Orlando, Fla. on Friday. 'Hillary needs your help. I need your help. America needs your help. Let's get to work.” 
Two weeks earlier WikiLeaks revealed how the Clinton/Obama-led corporate wing of the Democratic Party works. An email sent in Oct. 2008 and hacked from the personal account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta showed Citigroup executive Michael Froman submitting names for dozens of positions in then-candidate Obama's anticipated presidential cabinet. 
'The cabinet list ended up being almost entirely on the money,” wrote David Dayen of the leaked message. 'It correctly identified Eric Holder for the Justice Department, Janet Napolitano for Homeland Security, Robert Gates for Defense, Rahm Emanuel for chief of staff, Peter Orszag for the Office of Management and Budget, Arne Duncan for Education, Eric Shinseki for Veterans Affairs, Kathleen Sebelius for Health and Human Services, Melody Barnes for the Domestic Policy Council, and more.” 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
'For the Treasury, three possibilities were on the list: Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, and Timothy Geithner.” 
Geithner ended up as Obama's Treasury Secretary, while Summers was a key author of the response to the 2008 recession as Director of Obama's National Economic Council. And from these men, Froman's Citigroup received the largest bailout the federal government gave during the financial crisis. 
'Many already suspected that Froman, a longtime Obama consigliere, did the key economic policy hiring while part of the transition team,” Dayen explained. 'We didn't know he had so much influence that he could lock in key staff that early, without fanfare, while everyone was busy trying to get Obama elected. The WikiLeaks emails show even earlier planning; by September the transition was getting pre-clearance to assist nominees with financial disclosure forms.” 
Dayen grants that Americans 'want an incoming administration to be well-prepared and ready to go when power is transferred. For Obama, coming into office while the economy was melting down, this was particularly true. But the revelations also reinforce the need for critical scrutiny of Hillary Clinton [italics added], and for advocacy to ensure the next transition doesn't go like the last, at least with respect to the same old Democrats scooping up all the positions of power well in advance.” 
Many pundits who support Hillary Clinton suggest that voters should focus exclusively on defeating Donald Trump. '[T]here is a logic to that idea,” Dayen wrote. 'Trump would legitimately be a terrifying leader of the free world. But there are consequences to the kind of home-team political atmosphere that rejects any critical thought about your own side. If the 2008 Podesta emails are any indication, the next four years of public policy are being hashed out right now, behind closed doors. And if liberals want to have an impact on that process, waiting until after the election will be too late.” 
'Who gets these cabinet-level and West Wing advisory jobs matters as much as policy papers or legislative initiatives. It will inform executive branch priorities and responses to crises. It will dictate the level of enforcement of existing laws. It will establish the point of view of an administration and the advice Hillary Clinton will receive. Its importance cannot be stressed enough, and the process has already begun.” 
Citing former Obama budget director Peter Orszag's suggestion this week that progressive Democrats, led by Elizabeth Warren, should be given the power to appoint their people to certain positions in exchange for certain concessions to the Wall Street-aligned wing, Dayen suggests that progressives have a greater chance to shape policy in 2016 than they did at the start of the Obama administration. And they should fight for it: 'The demand to only hold one thing in your head at a time—that Trump must be stopped—would squander this opportunity.” 
To repeat what Obama told voters Friday: 'You have a chance to shape history.” TAGS:

Electric Floors Could Generate Renewable Energy From Walking Posted on Oct 29, 2016 Chuck Coker / CC BY-ND 2.0 
LONDON—US scientists have found a new way to generate energy at home: the tribo-electric floor. Tread on it and it will convert the kinetic energy of a footstep into a current of electricity . And it's made from the waste wood pulp that already serves as cheap flooring throughout the world. Xudong Wang , an engineer and materials scientist, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues report in the journal Nano Energy that they have taken cellulose fibres from forest waste material and chemically treated them in a way that creates an electric charge when they come into contact with untreated wood pulp fibres. The result: a patented, tribo-electric nanogenerator floor covering that can harness the energy of any footfall, and turn it into electric current that could light up a room or charge a battery. So far, it exists only as a laboratory prototype. It promises, the scientists say, to be cheap and durable. And it exploits a waste material available wherever there is a forest industry. 'Our initial test in our lab shows that it works for millions of cycles without any problem,” Professor Wang said. 'We haven't converted those numbers into years of life for a floor yet, but I think with appropriate design it can definitely outlast the floor itself.” Long wait The gap between any laboratory experiment and a commercial success is huge, and many promising products never make it, or take years of further experiment. But this study is yet another example of the extraordinary explosion of ingenuity prompted by the need to generate energy in ways that sidestep the greenhouse gas emissions that have been driving dangerous climate change. Engineers, nanotechnologists and chemists have tested ways to make windows and even solar panels by making timber optically transparent . They have looked more closely at the tree's relationship with the sun and fashioned a bionic leaf that can exploit sunlight 10 times more effectively to create biomass that could be turned into a liquid fuel. They have dreamed up an electric car battery that can renew itself with atmospheric carbon dioxide , and a bacterial fuel cell that generates electricity from waste water. Energy conserved And they have even devised the ultimate in power dressing – a fabric that as it rustles could charge a cellphone. Such research starts from the laws of thermodynamics, which dictate that energy must always be conserved. The energy involved in a plate of food, a footstep, the sprouting of a seedling or the turning of a turbine is still energy: there could be a way to recycle it rather than let it dissipate as heat into the atmosphere. What Professor Wang and his team have done is exploit the same property that creates static electricity in clothing: the tribo-electric effect which turns vibration into charge. The ground beneath the foot is a source of potential energy: the challenge is to find a way to plug into it. In theory, a busy motorway could become a renewable power source. Professor Wang and his team have already tested a nanogenerator that recovers energy from rolling tyres . Then they turned to the surface under the wheels. 'We've been working a lot on harvesting energy from human activities. One way is to build something to put on people and another way is to build something that has constant access to people” 'Roadside energy harvesting requires thinking about places where there is abundant energy we could be harvesting,” said Professor Wang. 'We've been working a lot on harvesting energy from human activities. One way is to build something to put on people and another way is to build something that has constant access to people. The ground is the most used place.” The team have tested a fabric less than 1mm thick made of tiny chemically treated and untreated wood pulp fibres: in contact, electrons move from one to the other. This electronic transfer creates a charge imbalance that must be righted. But as the electrons return, they pass through an external circuit and deliver energy. In theory, the electric floor technology could be incorporated into all kinds of flooring. In theory, extra layers of the fabric could deliver even more power. The next step is to demonstrate the concept by putting a sheet of it down in a high-profile spot in the university campus. 'This development shows great promises in creating large-scale and environmentally sustainable tribo-electric board for flooring, packaging and supporting infrastructures,” the authors write. 
Tim Radford, a founding editor of Climate News Network, worked for The Guardian for 32 years, for most of that time as science editor. He has been covering climate change since 1988.

Truthdigger of the Week: Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault II Posted on Oct 29, 2016 Dave Archambault, outside the Washington, D.C., courthouse where appeals court judges heard his tribe's challenge to the Dakota Access pipeline. (Jessica Gresko / AP) 
Demonstrations against the construction of a $3.8 billion oil pipeline in North Dakota began to receive much-needed mainstream media coverage this week when law enforcement and protesters faced off in a tense confrontation that ended in at least 140 arrests. While many people only recently may have learned of the fight against the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL), Standing Rock Sioux tribe Chairman David Archambault II has worked for two years to prevent its construction. 
Some background: The proposed pipeline would cut across the Missouri River just upstream of land belonging to the Standing Rock Sioux. It could threaten the tribe's only water source if a leak were to occur (and as many environmental activists note , leaks always occur.) Over the past several months, the tribe has begun to receive support from other 'water protectors,” and peaceful demonstrations—such as prayer circles—have become a regular aspect of life on the Standing Rock reservation. 
Archambault attended Standing Rock High School and earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from North Dakota State University and a master's in management from the University of Mary in Bismarck, N.D. As chairman of the tribe, he has been at the forefront of opposition to the DAPL. In an August op-ed for The New York Times, Archambault wrote: 
Our tribe has opposed the Dakota Access pipeline since we first learned about it in 2014. Although federal law requires the Corps of Engineers to consult with the tribe about its sovereign interests, permits for the project were approved and construction began without meaningful consultation. … 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
The Dakota Access route is only a few miles shorter than what was proposed for the Keystone project, yet the government's environmental assessment addressed only the portion of the pipeline route that traverses federal land. Domestic projects of this magnitude should clearly be evaluated in their totality—but without closer scrutiny, the proposal breezed through the four state processes. 
Archambault represents his community and its fight to protect the water, eloquently expressing the racial, economic and political factors moving the construction of the DAPL forward. 'Perhaps only in North Dakota, where oil tycoons wine and dine elected officials, and where the governor, Jack Dalrymple, serves as an adviser to the Trump campaign, would state and county governments act as the armed enforcement for corporate interests,” he writes in his op-ed. 'It's a familiar story in Indian Country. This is the third time that the Sioux Nation's lands and resources have been taken without regard for tribal interests.” 
In recent months, demonstrations against the DAPL have increased in size, and the police response has grown more intense. Law enforcement and DAPL officials have set dogs on protesters , used pepper spray , sound cannons and rubber bullets . As the situation intensifies, Archambault continues to speak powerfully on the injustices. 
Earlier in October, for example, he explained the status of the ongoing legal challenges to the pipeline and urged President Obama to get involved. 
</p><p> 
'Any time infrastructure projects like this come near, we are invisible,” he told Amy Goodman on Democracy Now! 'We have lands, treaty lands, that are being encroached on. And we know that there are sacred places there, and we know that the pipeline needs to stay away from those sacred places, but they keep—they continue to come and desecrate those sacred places.” 
Other protests against the government have ended in violence—take, for example, the armed standoff between Ammon Bundy and law enforcement in Oregon earlier this year. But the Standing Rock Sioux tribe remains committed to peace, even as police continue to escalate the confrontation. As tribal chairman, Archambault reinforces this commitment to peaceful and spiritual protest. 
'[W]e're asking everybody to remain prayerful and peaceful and not to react to any form of aggression that law enforcement brings,” he said in an interview on National Public Radio . 'We don't want to see the construction workers get hurt, we don't want to see law enforcement get hurt, and we definitely don't want to see people who are standing up to protect water to get hurt.”

What the WikiLeak Revelations Reveal About Donna Brazile and the DNC Posted on Oct 28, 2016 ( Tim Pierce / CC 2.0 ) 
Donna Brazile, interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, faces new scrutiny as evidence points to abuses of power. 
Brazile's alliance with the Hillary Clinton team looks to have started in 2008. In February of that year, while Clinton was running for president against Barack Obama, CNN political commentator and consultant Paul Begala wrote an email to the Clinton team saying that it should 'court” Brazile. At that time, during the primaries, Brazile refused to publicly endorse a candidate but worked closely with the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Until recently, she also worked for CNN and ABC News. Her close relationship with the Clinton camp has deepened over the years. 
Evidence that Brazile would begin working to help Clinton is seen in an interview she gave with Joe Heim of The Washington Post in 2014. She told Heim: 
Technically, I'm neutral, but neutrality is something that gets you in trouble because, you ever notice someone who stands on the white line in the middle of the road? They get run over. And I don't want to get run over. So I'm not neutral. I have to tell people that I'm neutral, but I'm ready for Hillary.

By the time this interview was conducted, she was already vice chair of the DNC. It is important to note that article 5, section 4 of the DNC Charter requires that the chairperson, national officers and staff of the DNC 'maintain impartiality and evenhandedness during the Democratic Party Presidential nominating process.” 
If the WikiLeaks emails are not falsified (and all evidence and history point to that being the case), this notion of impartiality was used by the Clinton camp, to its advantage, throughout the primary campaign. 
In late October 2015, Adrienne K. Elrod, director of strategic communications and amplification for Hillary For America, sent out an email under the title 'Bernie Pushback Update” that included a broadcasting strategy with the help of Brazile . The plan was to have Brazile appear on TV in the guise of a 'strategist” and call out rival Bernie Sanders' campaign for having a 'Bad Strategy.” 
Elrod wrote: 'All of our friends going out tonight post debate, including [former Michigan Gov. Jennifer] Granholm, Donna Brazile and [political consultant] Bill Burton, are ready to call Bernie's team out if it comes up tonight.” 
The email was a response to a critique of Clinton by Sen. Sanders. 
The reliance on Brazile for help appears to have continued into the new year. On Jan. 3, 2016, an email exchange between John Podesta and Brazile titled 'Happy New Year” went as follows: 
Subject: Re: Happy New Year 
On Jan 3, 2016, at 2:25 PM, John Podesta wrote: Wishing you a happy New Year. 2015 was challenging, but we ended in a good place thanks to your help and support. Look forward to working with you to elect the first woman President of the United States. >> Have a great New Year. >> -John 
On Sunday, January 3, 2016, Donna Brazile wrote: As soon as the nomination is wrapped up, I will be your biggest surrogate. 
On Jan 3, 2016, at 19:33 PM, John Podesta wrote: Thanks Donna. Holed up in the bunker and miss seeing you. 
Two days after this exchange, Brazile let the Podesta team know that Sanders was planning to launch a Twitter campaign. The emails reveal that the impartiality clause in article 5, section 4 would be violated again and again. 
On Feb. 2, she sent an email to Podesta titled 'Good Luck Tonight” and wrote 'Shake things up. It's going to be rough. Very rough.” This was the day before a town hall event in which Clinton and Sanders would appear. 
More damning is an email Brazile sent to Podesta on March 12 titled 'From Time to Time I Get The Questions In Advance.” In the email, she wrote, 'Here's one that worries me about HRC.” It was a question on the death penalty that was asked—verbatim—the following day at the town hall with Sanders. 
Brazile released a statement earlier this month after the Podesta emails revealed this exchange. 'I often shared my thoughts with each and every campaign, and any suggestions that indicate otherwise are simply untrue,” Brazile said in the statement. 'As it pertains to the CNN debates, I never had access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I did.” 
Perhaps the DNC could be forgiven by claiming they did not know Brazile had such deep ties to Clinton and her campaign. But on July 22, before the Podesta emails were revealed, WikiLeaks released more than 19,000 DNC emails. The revelations forced DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz to resign after evidence pointed to a heavy bias against Sanders. Brazile was chosen as interim chair, even though the DNC leaks revealed her potential bias. 
In an email exchange, Abby Phillip of The Washington Post asked Brazile to respond to allegations that the DNC was not giving adequate representation to the Sanders camp. Brazile's response: 'I have no intention of touching this. Why? Because I will cuss out the Sanders camp!” 
In addition, new videos surfaced last week from conservative activist James O'Keefe alleging that the Clinton camp and the DNC worked with influential Democratic operatives on dark campaign strategies against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The videos and allegations mostly center around interviews with Scott Foval and Robert Creamer. Foval was a Democratic operative and national field director for Americans United for Change. Creamer was a Democratic operative working for the DNC , a consultant for Americans United for Chance, the founder and president of Democracy Partners and the husband of Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky. 
In the videos, Foval talks about inciting confrontation and violence on behalf of the DNC and the Clinton campaign at Trump rallies. Foval is also seen talking about voter fraud schemes and is caught saying, 'We manipulate the vote with money and action, not with laws.” 
Creamer, who is also implicated throughout the videos, has a seemingly close relationship with President Obama. Since 2009, Creamer has visited the White House 342 times, including having made 40 visits to Obama himself. The videos also reveal that Creamer is well connected to the Clinton campaign; he boasts about talking on the phone with campaign operatives at 10:30 a.m. every day. The WikiLeaks documents confirm that they indeed had a close relationship. 
Aaron Black, a DNC rapid response coordinator who worked under Foval, can also be seen taking credit for the shutdown of a Chicago rally for Trump in March. Trump had to cancel his appearance after violence broke out. 
According to O'Keefe, one of the terms used for inciting this type of conflict is known as 'bird-dogging.” Multiple Podesta emails make reference to this term. One email written by Ilyse G. Hogue, director of political advocacy and communications at MoveOn.org, explained: 'Our members are bird dogging Republican candidates in character all over the country. They dress up as execs from 'RepubliCorp' a not-so-fictitious merger between the Republican party and multi-national corporations and go to events.” However, the emails making reference to bird-dogging do not implicate the kind of violence that Foval does in the videos. 
According to The Washington Post reports : 'Bird-dogging is a fairly common activist tactic, and reporters often recognize it when seemingly 'perfect” questions come from a political audience.” 
The videos also allege that Hillary Clinton herself had an idea to place people in Donald Duck costumes at every Trump and Pence rally. The video alleges that Clinton and the DNC wanted Americans United for Change to make this happen. According to O'Keefe, if the Clinton campaign and the DNC worked with the group, it would be an 'illegal coordinated campaign expenditure” and a violation of Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulations. According to the video, the Clinton campaign and the DNC (including Brazile) talked on the phone with Creamer to coordinate where the 'Donald Ducks” should be placed. Foval said any messages the 'ducks” were carrying had to be cleared with the DNC. Creamer was asked why the DNC didn't fund the project itself. He explained that the committee was worried about a trademark issue between Brazile and ABC, which is owned by Disney. 
For some added context, O'Keefe has a history of sometimes editing videos in a way that slightly misrepresent the story. 
Since the videos were released, Foval has been fired from Americans United for Change and Creamer announced his resignation from the DNC. 
Democracy Partners released this statement on Oct. 18, 2016: 
Our firm has recently been the victim of a well-funded, systematic spy operation that is the modern day equivalent of the Watergate burglars. The plot involved the use of trained operatives using false identifications, disguises and elaborate false covers to infiltrate our firm and others, in order to steal campaign plans, and goad unsuspecting individuals into making careless statements on hidden cameras. One of those individuals was a temporary regional subcontractor who was goaded into statements that do not reflect our values. 
According to The Washington Post, neither man defended the 'content of the videos,” but instead questioned the way the videos were edited and the impartiality and history of O'Keefe himself. You can watch the videos here . 
After the third presidential debate last week, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly grilled Brazile over the allegations in the video and the WikiLeaks emails. Brazile refused to answer directly. Instead, she said she was being 'persecuted” and that she wouldn't 'validate falsified information.” Asked if the videos were falsified, she dodged the question and Kelly pointed out that no one has come forward to question the videos' legitimacy. Pressed regarding the WikiLeaks emails, Brazile responded: '… Thank God, I have not had my personal emails ripped off from me and stolen and given to some criminals to come back altered.” She added, 'I have seen so many doctored emails. ... I will not sit here and be persecuted, because your information is totally false.” 
Robert Graham, from tech blog Errata Security, wrote that using a mechanism called DKIM he was able to prove that none of the emails was modified or doctored . 
You can watch the Kelly-Brazile interview below: 
</p><p> 
On Monday, Brazile appeared on Tavis Smiley's talk show, continuing to spin the WikiLeaks emails. She refused to respond to the actual content, saying that the source of the leaks was 'people who have proven to lie and manufacture stories” and that she was launching a cyber security task force. To date, none of the WikiLeaks releases in the past 10 years of publication (which include more than a million documents) ever has proved to be altered or false. Brazile asked Smiley, 'How do you disprove a lie?” and repeatedly invoked Russia, claiming that the Russians were trying to sow 'seeds of doubts into our entire election apparatus.” Resurrecting Cold War sentiment against Russia is not exclusive to Brazile. In fact, the Clinton camp has been doing plenty of this. 
People have every right to fear a Trump presidency, but when Clinton talks about a no-fly zone in Syria and the DNC is pushing the theory that Russia is trying to undermine the U.S. election, questions must be asked. If the Podesta emails are real, one can see a long history of ulterior motives at play. As of now, Brazile remains the chair and face of the DNC and Clinton looks set to be our next president. TAGS:

Tom Hayden Fought for the Rights of All Living Things Posted on Oct 28, 2016 ( Steve W. Grayson / AP ) 
Tom Hayden and I happened to be on the same flight from Los Angeles to Sacramento as he prepared to begin his first year in the state Legislature in 1982. 
We sat next to each other and began to talk. For me, it was an unexpected treat. I always enjoyed the company of a man who, rather than talk about himself, seemed so interested in what others had to say. 
That, in fact, was one of his great qualities, rare in public figures—especially in elected politics, the business Hayden was about to enter. He was nice to people, charming in an unassuming way. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
On the plane to the capital, Hayden questioned me on how the Legislature worked. He wanted hints on getting along with his new colleagues, pitfalls to avoid, opportunities to do good. How would he, the famous antiwar radical, be treated by Sacramento's conventional establishment? They were, after all, conventional politicians, including supporters of the Vietnam War he had opposed, and were still angry over the anti-war demonstrations at the Democratic National Convention. Hayden had been a leader in that protest. 
Here's what happened after he got to Sacramento: While never one of the guys, Hayden compiled an impressive record in 10 years in the California Assembly and eight in the California Senate. He got millions of dollars for his district to improve the quality of Santa Monica Bay and rebuild the Santa Monica and Malibu piers. He helped delay University of California and Cal State University tuition increases. He led efforts that extended laws against sexual harassment. Also included in a long list of legislation was his Hayden Act, which extended the time shelters must keep abandoned animals alive, giving volunteers more time to find them homes. 
I got to know him best when he was involved in the frustrating work of local politics. I followed him around during his losing campaign for Los Angeles mayor in 1997. As a state senator, he campaigned through neighborhoods in an easy, relaxed manner, making some of his more controversial proposals sound palatable. Even when meeting with the editors of the Los Angeles Times, he passed the test of convincing his stuffy listeners that he wasn't a threat to them and the city. 
These were mild efforts compared to his greatest Los Angeles crusade, taking up the cause of Salvadoran gang members in the abysmally crowded slums of a part of the city known as Pico-Union. The violent gangs were being targeted by the Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart Division anti-gang officers, some of whom turned out to be violent and crooked themselves. The public strongly supported the police, and anyone standing up for gang members was scorned and headed for political death. 
Caught up in all this was a Salvadoran gang member, Alex Sanchez , who served time in juvenile camps and state prisons for crimes including car theft and possession of weapons. A community leader, he was also trying to negotiate peace between rival gangs. It was clear, Hayden felt, that the Rampart gang cops and the immigration service disapproved of Sanchez's leadership ability and peacemaking and were cooperating illegally to send him back to bloody El Salvador. 
The Times was investigating the Rampart cops intensely. Hayden wanted us to also dig into the Sanchez case. By then, defense of Sanchez had become a movement extending beyond Pico-Union. 
Hayden came to the paper with a few other Sanchez supporters to meet with me and other editors. He recalled our meeting in his book 'Street Wars.” Hayden said we editors 'sat sphinxlike listening to our tale. I wondered if we were becoming too emotional, too conspiratorial.” But Hayden convinced us, and we quickly put reporters on the Sanchez story. 
Police continued their efforts to get rid of Sanchez. He was charged in 2009 with taking part in a 2006 gang murder. At this point, Sanchez was a well-respected leader in efforts to stop gang violence. It took three more years, but in 2012, charges were dropped in what prosecutors admitted was a flawed case. 
This was not a cause that attracted national attention. Helping the immigrant community organize was tough, gritty work for Hayden. It took him to Central America on an arduous trip to meet gang members in their homelands, where they had been deported, visiting the prisons where many of them were kept. 
In recent years, his health was failing. He looked older and thinner. But he persevered, just as he had during the Vietnam War protest era and the civil rights movement. That activism and his leadership in the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests helped shape national politics. 
But Tom Hayden will also be remembered for his other, less well-known accomplishments—by many in the still crowded Pico-Union slums, by swimmers and surfers at the Santa Monica beach and in shelters where volunteers seek homes for the abandoned animals that his Hayden Act helped save. TAGS:

Here Are Six 'Miracle' Drugs Big Pharma Now Regrets Posted on Oct 29, 2016 
By Martha Rosenberg / AlterNet Shutterstock 
Are you depressed? It may have less to do with your mood than your birth control pills, high blood pressure pills, antibiotics or even anti-hair-loss drug according to new research. New risks have also emerged with popular gastroesophageal reflux disease medicines and even the top-selling painkiller Tylenol. 
There are two reasons the risks associated with popular drugs seem to trail their aggressive promotion. Certainly, as millions use brand name drugs, dangerous side effects and adverse events are seen that did not emerge in much smaller clinical trials. Who knew? But also, as AlterNet has noted before, dangerous side effects that might be considered major drawbacks to prescribing the drugs often emerge only when drugs have gone 'off patent” and all their profit potential is realized. For both reasons, drug safety activists recommend waiting five years before taking a 'new” drug—until it is not 'new” anymore. 
Advertisement 
Here are drugs and drug classes that have raised new concerns. 
1. Proton Pump Inhibitors 
One of Pharma's most successful gambits has been its proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like Nexium (the 'Purple Pill”) and Prilosec that reduce stomach acid. To sell the drugs, Pharma aggressively raised 'awareness” of gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD a rare condition which, over time, can change the lining of the esophagus and lead to cancer. Actually, most PPI users have simple heartburn. Even babies are now given PPIs for 'baby reflux” because they spit up 71 times a day—a normal occurrence that has been pathologized. 
The medical establishment has deplored PPI overuse, pointing out that heartburn can exist without esophageal damage and vice verse and calling PPIs 'purple crack.” Now it turns out they are right—acid reducers are addictive. 'Once a patient has taken a PPI for longer than a few weeks, acid hypersecretion can occur on discontinuation,” says a recent article in Pharmaceutical Journal. 'This causes rebound symptoms, and frequently establishes a vicious cycle of drug reinitiation and long-term continuation.” 
Adverse effects of long-term PPI use are well documented from the risks of the dread intestinal infection Clostridium difficile ('C Diff”), bone thinning and fractures and vitamin and mineral deficiencies to chronic kidney disease and heart attacks. Now there is a new reported risk: dementia. 
A study earlier this year in JAMA Neurology of 73,?679 people 75 or older with no dementia and taking PPIs found the patients 'had a significantly increased risk of incident dementia compared with the patients not receiving PPI.” Other studies have also found a link. 
2. Antibiotics 
AlterNet has frequently written about underreported antibiotic dangers, most recently of the fluoroquinolone class which includes Cipro and Levaquin. Even as the FDA tries to curtail use of antibiotics on the nation's farms to make animals grow faster (a use which accounts for most U.S. antibiotic sales) drug use on the farm is actually increasing. The FDA's 2014 Summary Report on Antimicrobials Sold or Distributed for Use in Food Producing Animals reveals that cephalosporin sales increased by 57 percent between 2009 through 2014, sales of antibiotics like clindamycin increased by 150 percent and sales of antibiotics like gentamicin, a dangerous drug class, increased by 36 percent. 
Antibiotics have a probable role in obesity—why wouldn't they when they add pounds to livestock? In 1974, Navy recruits were given antibiotics to see if they would gain weight, and after only seven weeks, they did. Similar results were seen in children in Guatemala and in babies . But making people fat or encouraging antibiotic resistant microbes like MRSA are the least of the risks, it turns out. 
We now know that the bacteria in our gut, the microbiome, which antibiotics compromise as they kill the 'bad” bacteria, are responsible for much more than good digestion. Antibiotics also affect the brain and 'influence our mood and temperament,” says food expert Michael Pollan. 'If you transplant the gut microbiota of relaxed and adventurous mice into the guts of timid and anxious mice they become less stressed and more adventurous.” Antibiotic-affected microbiomes may also be behind asthma and autoimmune diseases, acne and even autism, say published reports. 
3. Birth Control Pills You know the long list of side effects and warnings at the end of drug ads? Telling you the drug may cause you to bleed to death or have a stroke while you look at images of sunsets and puppies? We have women's health advocates to thank for the disclosures. Fifty years ago when the Pill first became available, there was no 'disclosure.” Women did not know what effects birth control pills would have on their bodies—or even think it was theirright to know—and were supposed to take them anyway.
By 1970, after The Doctors' Case Against the Pill by Barbara Seaman was published, Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson held hearings about clear links between the Pill and depression, blood clots and decrease in libido cited nowhere on the label. No women were asked to speak at the hearings, moving Alice Wolfson, a co-founder of the National Women's Health Network, to say, 'It must be admitted that women make superb guinea pigs. They don't cost anything, they feed themselves, they clean their own cages, pay for their own pills, and remunerate the clinical observer. We will no longer tolerate intimidation by white-coated gods antiseptically directing our lives.” 
Why were feminists so angry about a drug that let them control their reproduction? Because the Pill caused 50 additional physiological changes besides stopping pregnancy, some of which were and are life-threatening. Women were told by the the male-dominated medical establishment not to worry their pretty heads about what the drugs were doing to their bodies, while men were spared any responsibility or medical risks. 
Fast-forward to this year, when medical studies again confirmed links between birth control pills and depression. A Danish study of more than a million women found links between birth control pills and depression, especially in young women, and corresponding higher use of antidepressant drugs. 
Women's health advocates were finally vindicated. 'The risk of depression has been recognized since women were able to get their hands on oral contraceptives,” says Cindy Pearson of the National Women's Health Network. 'It's been reported by women for 50 years.” 
A 2013 book called Sweetening the Pill: or How We Got Hooked on Hormonal Birth Control might also be vindicated, writes Lara Prendergast. The book was called 'a dishonest anti-Pill treatise” because the author 'dared to point out that hormonal contraceptives are ranked by the World Health Organization as a class-one carcinogen alongside tobacco and asbestos,” she writes. 
4. Propecia 
Two years ago, AlterNet told readers about Propecia, a popular treatment for male pattern baldness linked to disturbing side effects in men including sexual dysfunction and actual reduction in penis size. At the time, Propecia's label assured users that sexual side effects 'went away in men who stopped taking Propecia”; however, the current label warns about sexual dysfunction like 'erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality” that continues after discontinuation of treatment. 
A September study in BMJ found 'the risk of erectile dysfunction was not increased for users of finasteride 1mg compared with unexposed men with alopecia [hair loss],” but reports of the disturbing side effects abound in medical j ournals and popular magazines. 
'Emerging research and a slew of lawsuits suggest that finasteride may be more dangerous than previously believed, with side effects — inability to orgasm, painful erections, chronic depression, insomnia, brain fog, and suicidal thoughts — that can last long after patients stop taking the pill,” wrote Men's Journal last year. 
Despite the life-changing side effects, Propecia/finasteride is still aggressively sold with warnings about its use downplayed and hard to find. In fact, 'As of Sept. 26, the World Health Organization Program for International Drug Monitoring's database of adverse drug reactions contained 13,546 finasteride ADRs [adverse drug reactions], including 3,577 sexual function and fertility disorders, 1,526 depressed mood disorders and disturbances, and 67 completed suicides,” writes the Post-Finasteride Syndrome Foundation . 
5. Tylenol 
Tylenol may be one of the most widely used pain relieving drugs in the world but new safety concerns continue to emerge. The risk of liver damage with Tylenol (acetaminophen) that can occur from taking even a slightly higher dose than directed moved Tylenol maker, Johnson & Johnson to increase warnings in 2014. Unintentional acetaminophen overdoses cause as many as 26,000 hospitalizations and 458 deaths per year reported the FDA. 
Soon after the increased warnings, medical journals linked acetaminophen to birth defects in the children of women taking the drug such as poor motor development, behavior problems and language delays. A study in JAMA Pediatrics identified an increased occurrence of ADHD by the age of seven in children whose mothers took acetaminophen. A study in the International Journal of Epidemiology found children more likely to have behavior problems and slow motor development by the age of three if their mothers had taken acetaminophen. Not all medical voices concur. Some said the studies were poorly designed or that fevers , for which the mother presumably took acetaminophen, are responsible for the birth defects. 
In recent years, acetaminophen has been found to have psychological and mental effects not before described. The pain reliever may 'blunt individuals' reactivity to a range of negative stimuli in addition to physical pain,” says one study. Another study found acetaminophen reduced the psychological pain caused by social rejection. 
6. Beta Blockers 
One out of three American has high blood pressure and beta-blockers like atenolol (Tenormin), carvedilol (Coreg), metoprolol, propranolol (Inderal), sotalol (Betapace) and timolol (Timoptic) which treat the condition have been linked to depression for many years. 
As early as 1967, the British Medical Journal reported that hypertensive patients treated with propranolol for cardiac arrhythmias experienced a rise in the incidence of depression. Still, it has not been known if patients' depressions were caused by the actual actions of beta blockers (like blocking the effects of epinephrine/adrenaline and slowing heart rate) or mood conditions associated with the diseases for which beta blockers are prescribed such as hypertension and congestive heart failure. 
Now, the evidence is tipping toward the drugs. An October study in the journal Hypertension found that beta blockers 'may have a role in the pathogenesis or course of mood disorders” and increased hospital admissions for mood disorders. A 'bidirectional relationship between depression and cardiovascular disease” exists, says the study , 'because of the overlapping pathophysiological processes that underlie both conditions.” 
'There is a lot of data that depression and cardiovascular disease are related ... but current hypertensive practices do not consider depression,” said the study's lead author Sandosh Padmanabhan. 'There could be some people who are predisposed to depression who we should not be giving these drugs.”

A Trump Named Sue (Video) Posted on Oct 30, 2016 
By Mark Fiore Award-winning animator Mark Fiore wonders if the Republican candidate can "sue his way to the White House" in his latest animation. Watch the clip and read the animator's thoughts on Trump below. When Donald Trump warns of a rigged election depriving him of the White House, his call to arms will most likely be a call to his lawyers. Judging by his track record, surely there has never been a more sue-happy nominee for president . If voters don't cooperate by Making America Great Again, maybe The Donald can sue his way to the White House. The American Bar Association sponsored a report that looked into Trump being a 'libel bully,” that is, suing people willy-nilly to shut them up. The report on Trump was so ominous, the ABA refused to publish it. Fortunately, you can find it here . If Donald Trump will sue anyone from bartenders to journalists to Miss Pennsylvania, surely he is not above suing voters who have the temerity to vote for Hillary Clinton. Of course lawyers helped get George W. Bush into the Oval Office, but Trump-law is a different story . Enjoy the cartoon and be sure to see what's going on over on my Patreon page .

We Must Tell the Truth About the Iraq War Posted on Oct 30, 2016 
By Jodie Evans / AlterNet Ewan McIntosh / CC BY-NC 2.0 
'The only silver lining of the Brexit vote is that it will reduce medium term attention on Chilcot – though it will not stop the day of publication being uncomfortable,” former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the previous U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell in a July 4th email obtained by the Intercept. 
As it turns out, these words would be prescient. The Chilcot Report , a damning 12-volume, 2.6-million-word inquiry into Britain's role in the Iraq War, did not get much attention on either side of the pond upon its July release. The probe was overlooked at a time that the Iraq War was still raging even though everyone thought it was over, and the millennials I talked to had little idea of the lies or the costs. This summer and fall, it became increasingly clear that the tumultuous U.S. election cycle will not propel anyone with a peace platform to the presidency. I decided I needed to do something that will be useful in the face of even more wars after the election madness is over. 
So we launched a People's Tribunal on the Iraq War as a tool to bring the anti-war movement together and build what is needed for 2017. We aim to lay the lies and costs at the feet of President Barack Obama and call for a commission on Truth and Accountability. There are years' worth of testimony in reports, lawsuits, books and articles. We have read the facts about the lies and costs over the years. But the totality has never been been pulled together to show the breadth of all effected. 
According to a report released last year by Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), Physicians for Global Survival and International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, the U.S. invasion and occupation killed at least one million Iraqi people. That would be more 10 million people in the United States if we compared it in terms of percentage of the population. Imagine the effect of 10 million people dying. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
There are over 100,000 casualties on the side of the U.S. and the coalition of the willing, with a small percentage of those dead. The rest are living with permanent physical and psychological wounds, some so bad that U.S. military veterans are committing suicide at a rate of 20 a day. In 2012, suicides surpassed war as a the leading cause of death in the U.S. military. 
Since 2001, U.S. wars have cost taxpayers nearly $5 trillion, according to a new report from Brown University's Watson Institute. But few can understand what that number actually means. Nor does this amount count the cost to people in Iraq or other members of the coalition of the willing. 
I have heard these reports at various tribunals over the years. But numbers and facts don't change hearts and minds. This tribunal will be different. It will be a people's tribunal, to be witnessed by the public, which will be presented with a large body of evidence. 
The participants on the days of the tribunal will be 'delivering” evidence with a five-minute statement about the meaning of that evidence. Dennis Kucinich will present the letter he wrote to Congress in October of 2002 outlining his research which showed there was no operational connection between the Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda or weapons of mass destruction. Jeremy Corbyn will deliver the Chilcot Report. Elizabeth Holtzman, the member of Congress in the 1970s recognized as the woman who impeached Nixon, will deliver her book calling for the Impeachment of George W. Bush. 
We will be joined by people from across the United States and world. The World Tribunal on Iraq , which culminated in Istanbul, Turkey and has held sessions across the globe, will deliver all of these testimonies. The Brussels Tribunal will deliver the book and testimony that emerged from their efforts. Inder Comar will deliver the documents that make up the ongoing class action suit against six members of the George W. Bush administration alleging that the Iraq War constituted a war of aggression. There will be over 50 offers of testimony each day. 
On day one, December first, we will focus on the lies that fed the drive to war. On day two, we will hear more than 50 people testify to innumerable costs of U.S. war in Iraq, which in fact goes back at least 25 years . 
Yes, there is a staggering cost to U.S. taxpayers—but also the cost to the planet and the militarization of our cities and police departments. We will hear from the mother of a young black man who was killed the last week of high school by a cop who was a veteran of the Iraq War suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. We will hear from soldiers who were raped by fellow soldiers. Rabbis and priests will discuss the cost to our morality. We will hear about the costs of the U.S. use of depleted uranium to Iraqis and the children of American soldiers who served there. The event will be live streamed on The Real News, with testimony delivered in person, by live stream or by video. The combination of all the testimony will be delivered to Obama and Congress. But the real work has already begun. The coalition is using the tribunal to gather local communities to discuss the cost of war to them, encouraging them to review what they could have had instead of war. Such collective exercises demonstrate how the costs of war come home, literally. 
Most of the members of our coalition are outreaching to their lists to join with a call to Obama for a Commission on Truth and Accountability. Other partners are outreaching for voices that still need to join those testifying. When the election is finally over, testifiers will begin to discuss their testimony in the media, laying a path to the tribunal of details, broken hearts, destroyed communities and devastated families. We must tell our truth as passionately and effectively as the architects of war tell their lies. We must come together and gather the stories of destruction and loss, in order to witness and remember. Join in. Make it your own. Share with your community. Raise awareness. The time to stop the next war is now.

$18 10 Things Anthony Weiner Did That Were Worse Than Storing Hillary Clinton's Emails on His Computer Posted on Oct 29, 2016 
By Juan Cole / Informed Comment 
WaPo is reporting that it was the FBI investigation of Anthony Weiner that caused new emails between Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin to come to light, which apparently might include forwarded State Department memos or correspondence related to State. 
Nothing produces upchuck in the throat like another headline with the name 'Anthony Weiner” in it. But here's an opportunity for me to reprint a column I once did on the things Weiner has said and done worse than sexting. The FBI was investigating him for sending suggestive messages to an under-aged girl. 
The nation is fixated on Trump's groping and Clinton's email server (uh, the State Department and the NSA got hacked folks, so it isn't the case that government servers are secure) and, well, maybe it was fixated for a brief second on Weiner's sexting. But we don't seem interested in serious policy questions like Syria and Iraq. Oh, the public got all het up about ISIL in 2014 and demanded something be done, but now it has lost interest. 
So here's an actually important policy issue on which Weiner shaped public opinion and helped make policy. 
The real scandal surrounding Anthony Weiner is that he is bigoted against Palestinians and has misused his position in Congress to support punitive policies against them. Americans appear to be bored by policy, titillated by private peccadilloes. But it is the policies that are important. Mahatma Gandhi was once kicked out of a brothel in South Africa. No one judges him by his lapses. Weiner, in contrast to Gandhi, has not worked for peace but has rather given knee-jerk support to the worst policies of the most far right-wing parties in Israel toward Palestinians. A social liberal in American terms, Weiner is so blinded by his allegiance to Israel and so studied in his ignorance of the Middle East that he has played a uniformly sinister role in that aspect of foreign policy.

Weiner: 
1. Called for Columbia University professor Joseph Massad to be fired for being critical of Israel; Weiner thus spearheaded a new McCarthyism. 
2. On the Israeli attack, in international waters, on the Mavi Marmara relief ship , Weiner sputtered: '”If you want to instigate a conflict with the Israeli navy it isn't hard to do. They were offered alternatives. Instead they chose to sail into the teeth of an internationally recognized blockade.” The blockade of Gaza civilians is a breach of international law; it is not internationally recognized and has on the contrary been condemned by almost every nation and human rights organization. 
3. Alleged that the New York Times is anti-Israel: 'Amnesty International in particular, has always had bias against Israel, and frankly I would argue that in many cases, the New York Times has, as well.” 
4. Alleged that the Palestine Liberation Organization is still listed by the US as a terrorist organization. It was dropped from the list over 2 decades ago. 
5. Tried to bar the Palestinian delegation to the United Nations from New York. 
6. Alleged that Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestine Authority, is not the head of the PLO. He is. 
7. Refused to condemn the use by Israel of cluster bombs on the civilian farms of south Lebanon in 2006. 
8. Alleged that the Israeli army does not occupy the West Bank and that there is no Israeli Army presence in the West Bank. 
9. Called Israel's [2009] war on Gaza a 'humane” war. 400 children were killed. 
10. Voted for Iraq War authorization in 2002, before later turning against the war. TAGS:

Masoud Barzani Pledges That Kurdish Forces Won't Enter Mosul Posted on Oct 29, 2016 
By Juan Cole / Informed Comment 
Masoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government (a super-province of Iraq) said Thursday that the KRG paramilitary, the Peshmerga, will not enter Mosul. 
He also remarked that last week's Daesh attack on Kirkuk was an attempt to divert attention from the terrorist organization's failures in Mosul. 
At a news conference in Ninewah Province with Ammar al-Hakim, leader of the National Coalition (and of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, a Shiite clerically led party), Barzani said, 'Peshmerga forces will not enter the city. The counter-terrorism brigades will be the ones who go in . . .” He was referring to the Iraqi army special forces, 3 brigades under the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service, which are crack troops who have been at the forefront of the liberation of Iraqi cities from Daesh (ISIS, ISIL). 
Barzani presumably made this announcement to assuage fears of Iraqi Arabs that the KRG would take advantage of the campaign against Daesh to annex Mosul or parts of Mosul to Iraqi Kurdistan, as they annexed Kirkuk province in 2014. It is significant that he said this in the presence of al-Hakim, an important Shiite clerical and political leader who is supporting the government of prime minister Haydar al-Abadi. Barzani is underlining that the Mosul campaign is national and not ethno-sectarian. 
Meanwhile, Central Command head, Gen. Joseph Vitel, estimated that in the week and a half of the Mosul campaign, some 900 Daesh fighters have already been killed. There were only an estimated 3500 to 5000 fighters in Mosul when the campaign began, with another 2000 in positions around the city. Presumably most of those killed belong to the latter group, meaning that the outskirts now have as few as 1100 fighters.

Vitel admitted that because the Iraqi army left the western gate of the city open and did not completely encircle Mosul, small bands of Daesh fighters were slipping out of the city in civilian clothing. Letting them escape, he suggested, was preferable to having to fight them all hand-to-hand in Mosul's back alleys. Moreover, civilians can escape by the same route, and some 10,000 have already fled. 
Hundreds of thousands of civilians could be displaced by the campaign, in a city of about 1 million (half its size before it fell to Daesh in 2014). TAGS:

$23 FBI Given Go-Ahead to Begin Review of Latest Batch of Emails in Clinton Case as Political Feuds Roil Posted on Oct 30, 2016 Out of line? FBI Director James Comey restarted the public controversy over Hillary Clinton's emails and is now under fire from Democrats and other detractors. (FBI) 
Here's the least surprising news of the day: FBI Director James Comey's decision to announce his agency's renewed investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's emails has sparked a highly politicized battle in various sectors of the U.S. government, with just over a week to go before the Nov. 8 presidential election. 
As of Sunday, the intelligence agency obtained a warrant to begin sifting through some 650,000 emails stored on a computer shared by embattled former Congressman Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to determine whether any of them were sent to or from Clinton's private server or contained classified material. According to The Wall Street Journal, the FBI, which had first learned of the newly discovered emails in early October, had already been dealing with internal tensions before this latest development occurred: 
The new investigative effort, disclosed by FBI Director James Comey on Friday, shows a bureau at times in sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the Clintons, and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national election campaign. Even as the probe of Mrs. Clinton's email use wound down in July, internal disagreements within the bureau and the Justice Department surrounding the Clintons' family philanthropy heated up, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Comey's move was framed instantly by mainstream outlets as a 'bombshell” after the story broke on Friday, and predictably, Clinton's camp questioned the timing and the hype it caused while calling for more details, and GOP nominee Donald Trump swiftly seized upon it as further evidence of his rival's corruption. 
On Sunday, outgoing Nevada Sen. Harry Reid echoed a former Bush White House ethics lawyer, Richard W. Painter, who in a New York Times op-ed published Sunday suggested Comey may have violated the Hatch Act and stated that he had filed a formal complaint through government channels: 
The F.B.I.'s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election. 
Such acts could also be prohibited under the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an election. That is why the F.B.I. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election. The usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment. 
That is why, on Saturday, I filed a complaint against the F.B.I. with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations, and with the Office of Government Ethics. I spent much of my career working on government and lawyers' ethics, including as the chief White House ethics lawyer for George W. Bush. I never thought that the F.B.I. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. Until this week. 
(For the sake of full disclosure, in this election I have supported Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, John Kasich and Hillary Clinton for president, in that order.) 
Painter added that considerations of intent are immaterial when it comes to Hatch Act violations; rather, emphasis is on the outcome, on whether it is clear that the official in question could sway the election. 
Sen. Reid had this to say about Comey and the Hatch Act: 
'Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be clear intent to aid one political party over another,” the letter says. 'I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act.” 
The act bars government officials from using their authority to influence elections. 
Reid also accused Comey of shielding Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump from scrutiny over his connections to Russia, saying 'it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination” between Trump and his advisers and the Russian government. 
Although FBI investigators have eight full days to scrutinize the contents of Weiner and Abedin's laptop, it is likely to take weeks before they conclude their review.

Iceland's Pirate Party Makes Strong Showing in New Election Posted on Oct 30, 2016 
By Common Dreams staff PiratesforIceland.party 
Iceland's Pirate Party has tripled its seats in the 63-seat parliament, Saturday night's election results show. 
Birgitta Jonsdottir, the leader of the Pirate Party, said she was satisfied with the result. 'Whatever happens, we have created a wave of change in the Icelandic society,” she told a cheering crowd early Sunday morning. 
The Pirates won 10 seats, more than tripling its three seats in the last election. The Left-Green Party also won 10 seats Saturday. 
The left-leaning parties — the Left-Greens, the Pirates and two allies — won a total of 27 seats, just short of the 32 required to command a majority in Iceland's Parliament, the world's oldest.

The governing center-right Progressive party lost more than half of its seats in the election which was triggered by Prime Minister Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson 's resignation in April in the wake of the leaked Panama Papers which revealed the offshore assets of high-profile figures. 
Current Prime Minister Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson said he would resign on Sunday. 
The anti-establishment Pirate Party, which was founded in 2012, had said it could be looking to form a coalition with three left-wing and centrist parties. 
The Pirates' core issues are: direct democracy, freedom of expression, civil rights, net neutrality, and transparency, all set out in a popular, crowdsourced draft of a new national Constitution that the current government has failed to act on. They also seek to re-nationalize the country's natural resource industries, create new rules for civic governance, and issue a passport to Edward Snowden.

Pirate Party founder and MP Birgitta Jonsdottir said she was 'very satisfied” with the result. 
'Our internal predictions showed 10 to 15%, so this is at the top of the range. We knew that we would never get 30%,” Ms Jonsdottir told Reuters. 'We want to see trickle-down ethics rather than make-believe trickle-down economics,” Ms. Jonsdottir, 49, who is also a former WikiLeaks activist, said 
'We are a platform for young people, for progressive people who shape and reshape our society,” Ms. Jonsdottir told Agence France-Presse. 'Like Robin Hood, because Robin Hood was a pirate, we want to take the power from the powerful to give it to the people.” Turnout in Iceland was 79.2%! If the US got anywhere near that, this would be a dramatically more progressive country. pic.twitter.com/9uCBBewNz2 — John Nichols (@NicholsUprising) October 30, 2016 TAGS:

Donald Trump on 'The Apprentice”: The false values of reality TV have been carried over into the current presidential race. (NBC) 
There is no shortage of signs of impending environmental catastrophe, including the melting of the polar ice caps and the rise of atmospheric carbon to above 400 parts per million . The planet's sixth mass extinction is underway. It is not taking place because of planetary forces. Homo sapiens is orchestrating it. We are at the same time bankrupting ourselves by waging endless and unwinnable wars. We have allowed our elites to push more than half the U.S. population into poverty and, often, profound despair through deindustrialization. We do nothing to halt the waves of nihilistic violence by enraged citizens who carry out periodic mass shootings in schools, malls, movie theaters and other public places. The political and financial elites flaunt their greed and corruption. Donald Trump appears to pay no federal income taxes. Bill and Hillary Clinton use their foundation as a tool for legalized bribery. Our largest corporations have orchestrated a legal tax boycott. The judicial system is a subsidiary of the corporate state. Militarized police carry out public executions of unarmed people of color. Our infrastructure, including our schools, roads and bridges, along with our deindustrialized cities, are in ruins. Decay and rot—physical and moral—are pervasive. 
We are blinded to our depressing reality by the avalanche of images disseminated by mass media. Political, intellectual and cultural discourse has been replaced with spectacle. Emotionalism and sensationalism are prized over truth. Highly paid pundits who parrot back the official narrative, corporate advertisers, inane talk shows, violent or sexually explicit entertainment and gossip-fueled news have contaminated cultural life. Reality television, as contrived as every other form of mass entertainment, has produced what might be called a reality presidential candidate. 
Mass culture, because it speaks to us in easily digestible clichés and stereotypes, reinforces ignorance, bigotry and racism. It promotes our individual and collective self-glorification. It sanctifies nonexistent national virtues. It takes from us the intellectual and linguistic tools to separate illusion from truth. It is all show business all the time. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
There are hundreds of millions of Americans who know that something is terribly wrong. A light has gone out. They see it in their own suffering and hopelessness and the suffering and hopelessness of their neighbors. But they lack, because of the contamination of our political, cultural and intellectual discourse, the words and ideas to make sense of what is happening around them. They are bereft of a vision. Austerity, globalization, unfettered capitalism, an expansion of the extraction of fossil fuels and endless war are not the price to be paid for progress and the advance of civilization. They are part of the savage and deadly exploitation by corporate capitalism and imperialism. They serve a neoliberal ideology . The elites dare not speak this truth. It is toxic. They peddle the seductive illusions that saturate the airwaves. We are left to strike out at shadows. We are enticed to succumb to the racism, allure of white supremacy and bigotry that always accompanies a culture in dissolution. 
We cannot, for this reason, discount the possibility that Donald Trump will be elected president. The election outcome will be decided by whatever emotion Americans feel when they cast their ballots. 
Celebrity narratives, manufactured pseudo-drama, sex scandals, natural disasters, insults and invective, mass shootings and war flash before us in a constant jumble of images on ubiquitous screens. The assault of images obliterates reality. A former congressman who sends a picture of himself in underwear to a woman is a national news story. Sober examinations of our economic, foreign, judicial and environmental policies are dismissed as too complicated and boring. It does not produce engaging images. The electronic media's sole goal is to attract viewers and advertising dollars. It has conditioned us to demand an endless vaudeville act. 
We are infected because of this mass indoctrination by what Daniel Boorstin in ' The Image : A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America” calls 'social narcissism.” The bottomless narcissism of Trump and Bill and Hillary Clinton cater to this social narcissism. They reflect back to us our desperate longing for, as well as celebration of, entertainment, celebrity, wealth, power and self-aggrandizement. It is not only advertising and public relations, as Boorstin points out, that carries out the incessant manufacturing of illusions that feed social narcissism. Journalists, book publishers, politicians, athletes, entertainers, positive psychologists, self-help gurus, the Christian Right and talk show hosts all feed the mania for illusion. They all chant the insane mantra that reality is never an impediment to what we desire. We can have anything we want if we work hard, get an education, believe in ourselves, grasp that we are exceptional and believe the impossible is always possible. It is magical thinking. And magical thinking is the only real commodity the elites have left offer to us. Make American Great Again. Or America already is great. Take your pick of idiotic clichés. 
'We tyrannize and frustrate ourselves by expecting more than the world can give us or than we can make of the world,” Boorstin writes. 'We demand that everyone who talks to us, or writes for us, or takes pictures for us, or makes merchandise for us, should live in our world of extravagant expectations. We expect this even of the peoples of foreign countries. We have become so accustomed to our illusions that we mistake them for reality. We demand them. And we demand that there be always more of them, bigger and better and more vivid.” 
The incessant search for instant gratification and the most appealing image, including the image of ourselves we manufacture for others on social media, has robbed us of the ability to examine ourselves and our society. It has extinguished the truth. The terminal decline of the American empire, the utter incompetence of our elites to manage everything from the ecosystem to the economy and foreign policy, the climate crisis, along with the widespread poverty and despair that defines over half of America, do not fit with the illusion. So these realities are blotted from public consciousness. The poor are rendered invisible. The climate crisis is ignored. The foreign policy debacles will be fixed with more bombs. A culture that can no longer discern or confront reality is unable to reform itself and dies. Only the Soviet and fascist dictatorships, along with the medieval Catholic Church, controlled thought as effectively.

Robert Frank Talks 'Radical Pragmatism' and the Economy Posted on Oct 31, 2016 
By Kathy Kiely / Moyers & Company Economist Robert Frank. (Robert Frank) 
Robert H. Frank is one of America's leading economists. In addition to reams of textbooks, he has written a number of books looking at the impact of the nation's widening income gap and the habits of the people who inhabit the economic stratosphere. The most recent is Success and Luck: Good Fortune and the Myth of Meritocracy . Recently, he stopped by the offices of BillMoyers.com for a conversation about the economic challenges facing the nation and the issues that he thinks the next president will have to address. This transcript has been edited lightly for length and clarity. 
Kathy Kiely: So tell me a little bit about, Robert Frank, your intellectual history. How did you come to be so interested in income inequality? 
Robert Frank: I started writing about competition for rank back in the early 1980s, late 1970s. The standard economic models assume that people care only about their absolute levels of consumption — you know, how big is their house, how fast is their car — in absolute terms. But those kinds of evaluations are almost always heavily context-dependent, so if you ask yourself, 'Is my house okay?” the answer to that question would depend really on the context that you're in. 
I was a Peace Corps volunteer before I went to graduate school and I lived in a two-room house with no electricity, no plumbing, in rural Nepal. Never once during the two years I lived in that house did it ever occur to me for an instant that the house was unsatisfactory in any way. It was a really quite nice house actually, in the context where I was living then. If I lived in a house like that in Ithaca, or any US city really, my kids would've been ashamed for their friends to see where we lived. It would've been shameful for me to have people know that we lived in a house like that. It would be a clear signal that I'd failed in some spectacular way to meet even the minimal expectations of society. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
And so, you know, is my house okay? The answer is that depends, and it depends on context and the context is very local. 
So if context matters, then the standard economic models that assume it doesn't matter lead you to many wrong conclusions. So I've been writing about that now for 35 years. And the entry point for inequality is that, as I say, context is local, but for technological reasons, which I've written about elsewhere too, we've seen a move to markets that Phil Cook and I call winner take all markets . 
These are — I mean, in your industry it's very prominent. You don't need the local newspaper columnist or radio reporter. Everything is available on the internet to everyone at any moment, and so whoever is best at the particular task at hand, that person gets the whole market. It's not quite that exaggerated, but that's the trend that we've been seeing, and with that have come many benefits. It's better to consume the best than the third best. 
The Winner-Take-All Effect 
But at the same time, it's led to an enormous concentration of economic rewards in the hands of the people who are judged to be best. They're often best by only a barely perceptible margin. Maybe they're not even best. Maybe they just got a lucky break and came to people's attention before the truly best performer did and then the initial success built on itself. 
But anyway, the trend has been for income to concentrate at the top of the ladder, and when that happens — you know, people at the top of the ladder are normal. They do what you and I do, what everyone else does when they have more income. They spend it and they build bigger houses, they buy more expensive automobiles, they take more expensive vacations, the diamonds they get for their partners are bigger. All those things are normal, and there's no indication I've ever seen that people in the middle class get angry about that. If anything, they're interested. They want to see pictures of the mansions and the yachts and read about what the rich people do. 
Kiely: Then why are people so angry in this election? 
Frank: The translation of what the people at the top do to the people in the middle is indirect. The people in the middle, as I say, don't seem to care that the people at the top have a lot. You're right, now there does seem to be some concern that people like Donald Trump, who claims to have billions, also admits to not having paid any federal income tax for a long time. That I think does arouse anger and concern across a pretty broad spectrum of the population. But in terms of the actual things rich people buy, I think most people feel that the people at the top earned their money fair and square—that's true in some cases, not true in others. 
But the people just below the top, they travel in the same social circles as the people at the top. They go to the same weddings, the same parties, the same gatherings, they belong to the same clubs. When they see that the very richest people are now hosting their daughters' wedding receptions at home rather than in a hotel or country club, they then feel, 'We need a ballroom,” so they build a bigger house. 
Then there's a group just below them, maybe it's the custom now to have dinner parties for 24, not 18: 'We need a bigger dining room.” They build bigger, and one step at a time, it cascades all the way down the income ladder. And unless you invoke something like that spending cascade is what I call it, you can't really make sense of the fact that the family in the middle, the median earner, whose real income is essentially the same as it was four decades ago, why is that family buying a house that's 50 percent bigger than what the median family bought four decades ago? What's driving that? It's not that they have more money. That's not the reason for it. 
Kiely: Is it keeping up with the Joneses on steroids? 
Frank: I've never liked that term. Somebody who's trying to — but, yes, in a manner of speaking, it is that. The term to me evokes a deep human frailty. Somebody is trying to appear richer that he is. He's insecure, he's trying to mimic a standard that he's not really entitled to on the merits of his own income. 
So, yes, that a pejorative term in my experience of how people use it, and the phenomenon I'm trying to call attention to would exist even if there were none of that. So the median family, it's gone into debt to buy a house that's at least 50 or 75 percent more expensive than what the median family was spending in 1970. 
Why Context Matters 
The reason it's done that is much less because they envy the houses of other people like them. It's because unless you spend as much as other people like you are spending on a house, your kids will go to bad schools. The link between school quality and neighborhood house prices in the school areas is very strong and direct. The better schools are located in the neighborhoods where the houses are more expensive. So if you're the family in the middle and it's your aim to have your kids attend a school of just average quality — you know, we would judge harshly a parent who wasn't at least that ambitious — then what do you have to do? You have to buy a house that's roughly near the price of what people like you are spending on houses. 
When all the families in that middle of the income distribution do that, what do they achieve? Nothing. You know, they just bid up the prices of the houses in the better school districts. Still half of all kids go to bottom-half schools, the exact same as before. But now families are in debt, they're not able to meet their bills month by month. Many of them file for bankruptcy. It's just been an enormous squeeze on the people in the middle, and that's driven by the spending at the top. And the reason we see more of it now is that the spending on the top is so much greater in relation to spending elsewhere in the income distribution. 
That's happened before. You know, when do you read about luxury? You read about it when the people at the top have been pulling away from everyone else. We read about it in the Gilded Age, the great fortunes of the late 19 th century. You notice it when there's that contrast. But it's still going on under normal circumstances. Right after World War II, incomes were growing at about the same rate for families up and down the income ladder and it was still true that what the family in the middle spent on a house depended on what the people at the top spent, but it wasn't — there was growth in balance up and down the line, so we didn't notice that families were getting squeezed relative to last year. Those stories didn't break through. 
Again, it's context. If you saw a seventh grader in the third grade, everybody would notice and remark on that. If you see a seven-footer at an NBA game, it's normal.

Changes in Rainfall Threaten Food Production Posted on Oct 31, 2016 
By Jan Rocha / Climate News Network Cattle farming and roads are major causes of deforestation in Brazil's Amazon region. (Kate Evans/CIFOR via Flickr) 
SÃO PAULO—The UN's latest State of Food and Agriculture (SOFA) report warns that rainfall patterns will have changed so drastically by the end of this century that agriculture, forestry and fishing will all be seriously affected. 
'It will become more and more difficult to harvest crops, rear animals and manage forests and fisheries in the same places and in the same way as before,” says the report by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). 
And that is a major concern for regions such as Latin America that are economically dependent on agriculture, and the Caribbean, which is heavily reliant on fisheries. 
In Brazil's northeast, for example, rainfall is expected to decrease by 22%, while in the southeast of South America, which covers parts of Chile and Argentina, it could increase by 25%. Rainfall changes 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
The report says these changes in rainfall mean 'that the capacity to face shortages or excesses of water will be fundamental in the efforts to improve productivity in a sustainable way”. 
A separate study carried out earlier by the FAO, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), and the Latin American Integration Associatio n (ALADI) shows that agriculture accounts for 23% of regional exports, employs 16% of the economically active population, and contributes 5% to regional GDP. 
The SOFA 2016 report predicts that climate change will bring more drought and increases in temperature that will reduce productivity in tropical and sub-tropical regions. It foresees more salinisation and desertification in the arid areas of Chile and Brazil, while along the Pacific coastline some fish species will move further south. 'The capacity to face shortages or excesses of water will be fundamental in the efforts to improve productivity in a sustainable way” 
In the Caribbean, the greater frequency of storms, tornadoes and cyclones will harm aquaculture (the farming of aquatic organisms such as crustaceans, molluscs, and aquatic plants) and fisheries, and temperature changes could alter the physiology of freshwater fish species and cause the sinking of coral reef systems. 
Forested areas could be transformed into savannas, while Amazonia will face the risk of frequent fires. In Central America, climate change could lead to 40% of mangrove species being at risk of extinction. 
The report notes that although governments in the region see a reduction in deforestation as the main method of combating climate change, forests continue to be converted for farming and cattle breeding, which are the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the region. Causes of emissions 
These emissions have three main causes. In 2014, they were: enteric fermentation—the product of the digestive systems of ruminants (58%); manure deposited in areas of pasture (23%); and artificial fertilisers (6%). 
The FAO warns that climate change would affect food production, reducing not only the amount available but the variety of foodstuffs. Extreme events in areas of large-scale production will have severe implications for trade, affecting the international supply of food. 
The report concludes that the climate changes it foresees would affect food and nutritional security in the region, causing abrupt variations in the incomes of families who depend on agriculture, or, where there is a fall in demand for paid rural labour, a reduction in their capacity to buy food. 
The effects could also include big changes to the diet of the population, with a fall in food variety and in healthy foods, leading to poorer nutrition. 
All in all, the FAO report offers a fairly bleak perspective if countries continue on their present path of sleepwalking into the future, with many governments unaware of or unwilling to face up to the challenges of climate change.

Europe Mounts Historic Challenge to Google's Domination of Tech Services Posted on Oct 31, 2016 Jon Russell / (CC BY-SA 2.0) 
The European Commission has slapped Google with three sets of monopoly charges , starting a fight that could cost the company up to 10 percent of its annual revenue and show American firms that 'there's a bazooka in Europe that can be shot at companies” that seek to obtain dominant market positions. 
The New York Times' DealBook reports: 
The cases relate to Android, Google's mobile operating system, some of its dominant online search services and some of its advertising products. 
While each response will be couched in legalese, Google's main argument is that its business practices do not fall afoul of the region's tough antitrust rules and that competitors can freely offer their own rival digital services to Europe's more than 500 million consumers. 
'Our search engine is designed to provide the most relevant results and most useful ads for any query,” Kent Walker, Google's general counsel, wrote in a blog post when previously rebutting some of Europe's antitrust charges. 'Users and advertisers benefit when we do this well. So does Google.” 
The company's detractors—including small European start-ups, some local politicians and significant American firms like Oracle—disagree with Google's optimistic outlook. 
'Google has taken its best shot, but the European Commission has decided that it's still on the right track,” said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer for FairSearch Europe, which represents those of Google's rivals that filed complaints against the company's perceived dominance. 
'I don't doubt Google feels like it has a strong defense. But that's what other previously dominant companies thought, too,” he added. 
DealBook continues: 
Whatever happens, Google's battle in Europe will not end overnight. 
European officials must first review the company's rebuttals, and a final decision in any of the cases is not expected until midway through 2017, at the earliest. 
If found to have breached the region's rules, Google faces fines totaling up to $7.5 billion, or 10 percent of its annual revenue, and may be forced to change how it operates in the 28-member bloc. While any antitrust fine is not expected to reach the maximum possible, the company is likely to appeal any European ruling, further lengthening the process. 
Yet it is this death-by-a-thousand-cuts regulatory limbo that arguably represents the biggest headache for Google.

Did a Dakota Access Pipeline Guard Carry an AR-15 Into Peaceful Protests?   
Last week, a series of peaceful protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline ended in the arrests of over 140 demonstrators . North Dakota law enforcement used rubber bullets, pepper spray, sound cannons and rubber bullets on the self-named 'water protectors,” causing Amnesty International to send in a delegation of 'human rights observers” to keep an eye on the tense situation. 
Evidence of the mistreatment of the peaceful demonstrators continues to emerge in the days since Thursday's intense confrontation. Shocking new video footage shows what appears to be a private security contractor wielding an AR-15 rifle, and members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe have since stated that the man attempted to enter one of the main encampments. 
Amy Goodman from Democracy Now! spoke with Dallas Goldtooth , an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network , to discuss the video footage and the escalating aggression by North Dakota law enforcement. 
'It was a very terrifying moment for a lot of us watching, I mean, to see this man pulling an assault rifle at our water protectors,” Gooldtooth explains. 'I think that he's a security contractor that has been hired by Dakota Access to guard its equipment, from what I believe, or at least to protect, you know, the workers or whatever it may be.” 
Goodman asks Goldtooth about the security contractor's intentions. 'There's a variety of accounts, but it was—from what I understood, that was told to me, that he was tasked with also identifying and being within the crowd, watching internally with the crowd, and that there was some suggestion that he might—he might have been tasked with instigating some sort of violence from within the crowd and to garner a reaction from law enforcement,” Goldtooth says.

Watch the full discussion below: 
In addition to the possible infiltration by a private security guard, a brush fire began on Saturday night near the main encampment. The water protectors allege that the fire was intentionally set by Dakota Access Pipeline forces. Goodman asked Goldtooth about the mysterious fire and the broader forces of repression working against the peaceful demonstrators. 
'[I]t was very, very clear that that brush fire that happened was an act of arson by unknown individuals,” Goldtooth says. 'But given the recent events with the Dakota Access worker, given the escalation of law enforcement, that, you know, a lot of fingers are pointing towards Dakota Access that—as being a culprit behind this late fire.”

I'm currently reading a book entitled ' Learning to Die in the Anthropocene ,” written by Iraq veteran Roy Scranton, who basically tells us that human beings have pretty much screwed themselves due to the vast and rapidly-approaching nightmare of climate change. If this book was designed to scare the holy shite out of people, it certainly has succeeded. 
According to Scranton, 'Human civilization has thrived in what has been the most stable climate interval in 650,00 years. Thanks to carbon-fueled industrial civilization, that interval is over.” Boom. 
But is anybody doing anything to stop this nightmare from happening? Only a few people are—mainly a small-but-courageous Indian tribe at Standing Rock, North Dakota. And what is America's reaction to this heroic stand against death by carbon? We have just spent hundreds of thousands of tax-payer dollars trying to tear-gas them, harass them, arrest them, pepper-spray them and shoot rubber bullets at them. Way to go America! Or not.

Thank goodness for the Standing Rock Sioux. Like it or not, they are protecting us. They are standing in place instead of us. They are bravely standing in front of a hurricane of climate-death and are doing it in our name. And all we do to thank them is to pay for the militarized police's tear gas, dogs and bullets that attack them. 
I propose another way to thank the Standing Rock Sioux. Let's all go to Standing Rock this Thanksgiving—and show them that we really do have something to be truly thankful for. 
PS: If you can't figure out how to get all the way to the Standing Rock Reservation, then consider having your Thanksgiving dinner in front of the Capitol building in Bismarck instead. Can't make it there either? How about Thanksgiving dinner in front of the US Congress or the White House. 
PPS: Standing Rock protestors, Black Lives Matter, various Chicano movements and Occupy are practically the only true Americans these days—Americans who are courageous enough to actually stand up to the US military-industrial complex that is gobbling up the rest of us alive. We should honor these protestors instead of bombing them with tear gas and attacking them with dogs. 
The rest of us whine and grieve that we are losing everything—but do nothing to stop it and just go along. 
PPPS: Aside from being victims of the climate-change hurricane that is now bearing down upon us post-haste, Standing Rock is also just more collateral damage right now (along with Syria, Palestine, Ukraine, Yemen, Libya, Iraq, Nigeria, etc.) in the neo-con 'wars” for oil. But who knows who the next 'collateral damage” will be? Probably us.

Read the Open Letter By Former Federal Prosecutors Criticizing James Comey Posted on Oct 31, 2016 FBI Director James Comey. ( Flickr / CC 2.0 ) 
Editor's note: This open letter was published on Hillary Clinton's website Sunday night in response to FBI Director James Comey's recent announcement regarding the agency's email review . See the full list of signatories on her website here . 
Sunday, as reported by the Associated Press , a group of nearly 100 former federal prosecutors and high-ranking [Department of Justice] officials from both Democratic and Republican administrations, including former [Attorney General] Eric Holder and former Deputy AG Larry Thompson, issued the following joint letter expressing serious concerns over FBI Director Comey's departure from long-standing department protocols: 
As former federal prosecutors and high-ranking officials of the U.S. Department of Justice, we know that the impartiality and nonpartisanship of the United States justice system makes it exceptional throughout the world. To maintain fairness and neutrality, federal law enforcement officials must exercise discipline whenever they make public statements in connection with an ongoing investigation. Often, evidence uncovered during the course of an investigative inquiry is incomplete, misleading or even incorrect, and releasing such information before all of the facts are known and tested in a court of law can unfairly prejudice individuals and undermine the public's faith in the integrity of our legal process. 
For this reason, Justice Department officials are instructed to refrain from commenting publicly on the existence, let alone the substance, of pending investigative matters, except in exceptional circumstances and with explicit approval from the Department of Justice officials responsible for ultimate supervision of the matter. They are also instructed to exercise heightened restraint near the time of a primary or general election because, as official guidance from the Department instructs, public comment on a pending investigative matter may affect the electoral process and create the appearance of political interference in the fair administration of justice. 
It is out of our respect for such settled tenets of the United States Department of Justice that we are moved to express our concern with the recent letter issued by FBI Director James Comey to eight Congressional Committees. Many of us have worked with Director Comey; all of us respect him. But his unprecedented decision to publicly comment on evidence in what may be an ongoing inquiry just eleven days before a presidential election leaves us both astonished and perplexed. We cannot recall a prior instance where a senior Justice Department official—Republican or Democrat—has, on the eve of a major election, issued a public statement where the mere disclosure of information may impact the election's outcome, yet the official acknowledges the information to be examined may not be significant or new. 
Director Comey's letter is inconsistent with prevailing Department policy, and it breaks with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections. Moreover, setting aside whether Director Comey's original statements in July were warranted, by failing to responsibly supplement the public record with any substantive, explanatory information, his letter begs the question that further commentary was necessary. For example, the letter provides no details regarding the content, source or recipient of the material; whether the newly-discovered evidence contains any classified or confidential information; whether the information duplicates material previously reviewed by the FBI; or even 'whether or not [the] material may be significant.” 
Perhaps most troubling to us is the precedent set by this departure from the Department's widely-respected, non-partisan traditions. The admonitions that warn officials against making public statements during election periods have helped to maintain the independence and integrity of both the Department's important work and public confidence in the hardworking men and women who conduct themselves in a nonpartisan manner. 
We believe that adherence to longstanding Justice Department guidelines is the best practice when considering public statements on investigative matters. We do not question Director Comey's motives. However, the fact remains that the Director's disclosure has invited considerable, uninformed public speculation about the significance of newly-discovered material just days before a national election. For this reason, we believe the American people deserve all the facts, and fairness dictates releasing information that provides a full and complete picture regarding the material at issue.

Dozens of Groups Call on Facebook to End Censorship Posted on Oct 31, 2016 
By Deirdre Fulton / Common Dreams Facebook had more than 1 billion monthly active users in the second quarter of 2016. ( Flickr / CC 2.0 ) 
As Facebook comes under fire for its alleged censorship and tracking of activists and protesters, a coalition of more than 70 groups and individuals has demanded the social media behemoth 'clarify its policy on removing video and other content, especially human rights documentation, at the request of government actors.” 
A letter —whose signatories include the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), 350.org, Color of Change, and the Indigenous Environmental Network—sent Monday cites recent incidents including: the deactivation of Korryn Gaines' account, the removal of iconic photographs, reports of suppression of Indigenous resistance , continued reports of Black activists' content being removed, and the disabling of Palestinian journalists' accounts. 
'These instances of censorship clearly point to the gaps in Facebook's automation and content guidelines,” said Nicole Carty of the consumer watchdog SumOfUs, which coordinated the letter. 'In order to mitigate these issues, Facebook must recognize these broader policy failures as human rights and free speech issues. From Black Lives Matter in the United States to journalists in Palestine, Facebook's lack of transparency has resulted in reports of censorship on almost a weekly basis, which proves that this is not an individualized 'glitch' but a broader policy problem.” 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
At the same time, the letter notes that with the launch of the live-streaming video function Facebook Live, the site 'is taking on an increasingly central role in controlling media that circulates through the public sphere. News is not just getting shared on Facebook: it's getting broken there.” 
In turn, the letter reads, 
we believe that taking urgent action to increase transparency and protect users is the first step to reaching our shared vision of the world. It is important not only for the integrity of its platform and the trust of its community of users, but also for the future of our media. Because the stories that don't get shared are as important as the ones that do. 
'Social media platforms are increasingly becoming the avenues for free speech, which makes ending censorship by companies like Facebook all the more critical,” added Chinyere' Tutashinda, national organizer at the Center for Media Justice. 'We are calling on Facebook to create policies that protect the most marginalized voices on their platforms: communities of color and low-income communities in the U.S. and across the globe.” 
Specifically, the letter calls on Facebook to: Make policies about how Facebook makes decisions to censor content clear and accessible to the public: whether those requests are from third-party agencies or through its algorithm—especially with respect to live broadcasting and journalistic content. Create a public appeals platform where users can appeal content censored by Facebook. Undergo an external audit on the equity and human rights outcomes of your Facebook Live and content censorship and data sharing policies. Refuse to disclose customer content and data to third-party agencies unless required to by law. 
Notably, the letter came on the same day that scores of Facebook users attempted to use the site's 'check-in” feature as a way to help shield Dakota Access Pipeline opponents by confusing law enforcement. While the fact-checking website Snopes largely debunked the strategy , it also quoted representatives from Sacred Stone Camp as saying that they 'support the tactic, and think it is a great way to express solidarity.” TAGS:

Emails and Groping: Our Halloween Election Keeps Scaring Us to Death   
Informed Comment. 
All Hallow's Eve, contracted now to Halloween, became conflated with the Scottish and Irish pagan Samhain, the harvest festival marking the end of autumn and the beginning of winter. It was an in-between time, when the barrier between this world and the next shimmered and let in decrepit old sprites and gods and monsters that had begun slipping away into the aether with the advent of Christianity. And, the souls of the dead of the past year intruded to visit their homes before being shunted off to the netherworld, as well. Since Celts thought power resided in the head, they often beheaded defeated enemies, so All Hallow's Eve was the occasion for a fair amount of fumbling about on the part of those who had died violently. 
The 2016 election is very much like Samhain, i.e. like Halloween, in breaking down ordinary time and reality, and letting ogres of the past into our daily lives. 
So we can't get out of our minds the image of those tiny hands, back in 1982, and 1996, and 1998, grabbing parts of strangers' anatomy. The simulacrum of the grabber and kisser and predator has popped out into 2016 and wants to replace George Washington and Ike Eisenhower. We are being asked, with a straight face, to elect a groper in chief. A puritan people who drove Gary Hart from politics for some hanky panky on The Monkey Business and impeached Bill Clinton even though he never got to third base, is now all right with making president someone who groped a porn star and then offered to drop $10,000 when he couldn't get his way. We are entranced and willing to give our fates into the hands of a weird combination of Frankenstein's monster and the Vampire Lestat.

The horror of Halloween always lies in the evil deeds of the past now resurrected, as with Syrian director Moustapha Akkad's 'Halloween” films. 
And we've had to hear again about the soiled blue dress and the conquests of Bill. 
And again about the Anthony Weiner sexting. And to learn what we never wanted to know, that the FBI is investigating him for sexting with a minor. I mean, if that isn't a Halloween horror movie I don't know what is. 
And Herbert Hoover has come back to tell us we're in a Great Depression and the only way to get out of it is to halt budget deficits and tighten our belts and lower taxes on the rich (the opposite of how FDR actually got us out of the Depression). The creepy dead and the blighted fading deities of old have come crowding through our 2016 rift in the time space continuum. Long-since failed and discredited trickle down economics has been cheekily resurrected. Why, if only you give more of the nation's money to the super-rich, they'll make you rich too. You'll see. Just wait. And wait. And wait. 
It is as though the worst nightmares of the old Soviet Communists finally came through, but with all the irony of history, only after they themselves had faded into the netherworld. 
( Human Rights 
And then there is the revived horror of the Japanese internment and the exclusion of Holocaust-threatened Jews from the United States, only with the perverse magic of Samhain the Japanese have become Mexicans and the Jews have become their spiritual cousins, the Muslims, the other Abrahamians. 
So no wonder Hillary Clinton's emails can't be killed. They are Undead emails, slipping in at the fraying of dimensional reality in this season of resurrected monsters and corpses, to haunt us. 
Only the silver stake of an actual election can finally kill these spiteful specters, and save us from this long night of phantasy horror. TAGS:

Will Hillary Clinton Get America Back on Track? Posted on Oct 31, 2016 U.S. Embassy London / CC BY-ND 2.0 
The parallels are striking. In the last decades of the nineteenth century – the so-called 'Gilded Age”— America experienced inequality on a scale it had never before seen, combining wild opulence and searing poverty. 
American industry consolidated into a few giant monopolies, or trusts, headed by 'robber barons” who wielded enough power to drive out competitors. A few Wall Street titans like J.P. Morgan controlled the nation's finances. 
These men used their huge wealth to rig the system. Their lackeys literally deposited stacks of money on the desks of pliant legislators, prompting the great jurist Louis Brandeis to tell America it a choice: 'We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we cannot have both.' 
We face a similar choice today. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Then, America chose democracy. President Theodore Roosevelt, railing against the ' malefactors of great wealth ,” broke up the trusts. And he pushed Congress to end the most blatant forms of corruption. 
His fifth cousin, FDR, went further – enacting social insurance for the elderly, the unemployed, and the disabled; a minimum wage and forty-hour workweek; the right to unionize; compensation for workers injured on the job; and strict limits on Wall Street. 
In other words, between 1870 and 1900, American capitalism got off track. Between 1901 and 1937 (the effective end of the New Deal), America put capitalism back on track. 
We're now in the Second Gilded Age, and American capitalism is again off track. It takes about three generations for Americans to forget how our system, unattended, goes wrong. And then to right it. 
Inequality is now nearly at the same level it was in the late nineteenth century. Half of all families are poorer today than they were a decade-and-a-half ago, the pay of CEOs and Wall Street bankers is in the stratosphere, and child poverty is on the rise. 
Meanwhile, American industry is once again consolidating – this time into oligopolies dominated by three or four major players . You can see it in pharmaceuticals, high tech, airlines, food, Internet service, communications, health insurance, and finance. 
The biggest Wall Street banks, having brought the nation to the brink of destruction a few years ago, are once again exercising vast economic power. And big money has taken over American politics. 
Will we put capitalism back on track, as we did before? 
The vile election of 2016 doesn't seem to offer much hope. But future historians looking back on the tumult might see the start of another era of fundamental reform. 
Today's uprising against the established order echoes the outrage average Americans felt in the late nineteenth century when they pushed Congress to enact the Sherman Antitrust Act, and when Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan fulminated against big business and finance. 
One hundred twenty years later, Bernie Sanders – the unlikeliest of presidential candidates – won 22 states and 46 percent of the pledged delegates in the Democratic primaries, and pushed Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party to adopt many of his proposals. 
At the same time, Donald Trump – a faux populist – has laid bare the deep discontents of America's white working class, which both parties have long neglected. Not incidentally, Trump has also jeopardized the social fabric of America and nearly destroyed the Republican Party. 
Hopefully some of America's current elite will conclude, as it did at the turn of the last century, that they'd do better with a smaller share of a growing economy fueled by a flourishing middle class, in a society whose members feel the system is basically fair, than in one riven by social and political strife. 
History has proven the early generation of reformers correct. While other nations opted for communism or fascism, Americans chose to make capitalism work for the many rather than the few. 
If Donald Trump is elected next week, all bets are off. 
But if Hillary Clinton assumes the presidency, could she become another Teddy or Franklin D. Roosevelt? 
You may think her too much of an establishment figure, too close to the moneyed interests, too cautious. But no one expected dramatic reform when each of the Roosevelts took the reins. They were wealthy patricians, in many respects establishment figures. Yet each rose to the occasion. 
Perhaps she will, too. The timing is right, and the need is surely as great as it was over a century ago. 
As Mark Twain is reputed to have quipped, 'history doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.”

Another Saudi War Crime in Yemen as 43 Prisoners Dead in Airstrike Posted on Oct 31, 2016 
By Juan Cole / Informed Comment 
Saudi airstrikes targeting a judiciary building in al-Hudayda, a port on the western coast of Yemen under Houthi control, have killed some 43 people and wounded dozens of others, most of them prisoners. 
The strike on the judiciary building, which had a prison attached, could have been predicted to kill civilians. It is therefore a war crime in international law. It isn't that hard, Riyadh. If you think taking the shot will possibly kill non-combatants, especially a lot of non-combatants, you can't take it. 
Prisoners are especially vulnerable since they are restrained. 
Whoever ordered that airstrike should be hauled before the International Criminal Court in the Hague. 
h/t wikipedia

In the past, the US military has warned the Saudis against hitting civilian infrastructure (including the port of al-Hudayda and a key bridge at that city) and Riyadh has blown Washington off and hit them anyway. Which makes me want to ask why the US hasn't completely dissociated itself from this bloodbath. 
In mid-September, jets of the Saudis and their allies killed 25 people in their private residences when they struck the residential al-Hunoud district (they were trying to hit a governmental building in the hands of the Houthis). 
On October 8, the Saudis struck a civilian funeral from the air . The US said it was reviewing its involvement then, but nothing changed. 
The Houthis have also committed war crimes, sending rockets on civilian neighborhoods in Najran, e.g., but in the nature of the case a small guerrilla group can't wreak the kind of havoc that an America-equipped state of the art air force can. 
The Saudi war on the Houthis of north Yemen has been going on for 18 months and for the past 14 months the Saudis and their allies have had exactly zero success. This is because you can't win a guerrilla war from the air, and there aren't enough Yemeni troops willing to fight for deposed president Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to take even major Sunni cities from the Zaydi Houthis. 
The Houthis bear a lot of the blame for the conflict, since they interrupted Yemen's constitutional process and made a coup, hand in glove with deposed president Ali Abdallah Saleh, in January of 2015. They then tried to take over the whole country, which wasn't plausible. 
The Houthis are a religious extremist movement hailing from the Shiite Zaydi branch of Islam. Part of what started their rebellion was Saudi proselytizing in Yemen for the anti-Shiite Wahhabi branch of Islam. 
About a third of the 22 million Yemenis are Zaydis, mainly in the northwest of the country. It was never very likely these 7 million could rule the 15 million Sunnis, or Sunni cities like Aden, and they were fairly swiftly kicked back out of it by the Arab coalition, in summer of 2015. (In fact, most of the 7 million Zaydis aren't pro-Houthi, so their ambition is even more overweening than this demographic suggests). 
The Houthis are braggarts who say they will overthrow the Saudi government. They have imprisoned many human rights workers. The Saudis accuse them of being Iranian puppets but that frankly is silly. They are an indigenous Yemeni movement and they got most of their weapons by raiding Yemeni army depots for American arms. Iran has probably given them a little help, but configuring what is going on as Saudi v. Iran in Yemen is ridiculous. 
Apparently the population in Sanaa, the capital, has swung behind the Houthis on nationalist grounds, and they've held big demonstrations against Saudi Arabia (Saudi bombed the demonstration). 
The Saudi-led war on Yemen has produced enormous hunger and displacement, which is likely only to get worse. 
The reason the Saudis keep committing these war crimes is that their tactics are unsuited to the struggle the want to wage. And if they go on like this, they will come to regret it. TAGS:

Trump Unveiled' Reveals the Big Con of Donald Trump's Presidential Run Posted on Nov 1, 2016 
By John K. Wilson ( OR Books ) 
Editor's note: The following is an excerpt from 'Trump Unveiled: Exposing the Bigoted Billionaire,” by John K. Wilson. 'Trump Unveiled” is published by OR Books. Click here for details. 
With his casino background, Trump is an expert at attracting gamblers, people who are willing to throw the dice with the irrational hope it will make their lives better. Trump understands how to recruit gamblers—by evoking hope and concealing facts. A casino doesn't tell you that you're likely to lose; a casino tells you that anything can happen, and you might just win, and what the hell, you'll have some fun along the way. That's the appeal of Trump's campaign: take a chance on me, and I'll give you everything. 
In fact, Trump literally promised 'everything” to his followers. Trump promised workers in Michigan, 'I'll get you a new job; don't worry about it.” If the cost of supporting Trump is so small (a mere vote) and the potential economic benefits are so great (a new job, economic prosperity, and global dominance), why not go for Trump? Trump is the cheapest lottery ticket you'll ever buy. And even if the odds that he'll keep his word are very small, why not take a gamble on Trump? 
This explains why Trump is so committed to denouncing America. He claims (despite all the evidence to the contrary) that the economy is a disaster, that the unemployment rate is really 42 percent, that everything is terrible, and that only he can make America great again. If you're trying to recruit a gambler, you need to make them feel like normal life is boring and miserable. Trump tells America that their lives are horrible, and even though it's factually not true for the overwhelming majority, they begin to wonder if he might be right. Everyone can imagine being richer and happier, and that's precisely the core appeal of gambling. 
As Trump the real estate developer put it: 'I play to people's fantasies. ... The more unattainable the apartments seemed, the more people wanted them.” Trump is applying the same principles to politics: Trump is presenting a fantasy of what people want from a president, and the more unattainable and unrealistic his promises are, the more people will want him even if they know they are being irrational. 
Trump's own lavish lifestyle serves his message. Trump loves to have rallies at airport hangers; it's not just the convenience of flying in and out quickly. The true appeal of it to Trump is that it reminds his audience how incredibly wealthy he is: he has a giant plane with his name on it. Trump is telling supporters, I've got a plane. Do you? Vote for me, and who knows, maybe you will. Might Trump's ostentatious display of extreme wealth turn off potential voters who are angry at financial inequality and the rigged system that favors the rich? The opposite is true: Trump is telling them the system is rigged and they're right to be angry at the rich, but Trump is the only one who can offer the salvation of getting rich yourself. Trump University was another form of shafting suckers gambling on Trump. Give Trump thousands of dollars to learn his secrets, and maybe, just maybe, you'll get really rich, too. 
Trump also understands that the best way to bring people to a casino is with a distraction, and the best kind of distraction is a fight. A big boxing match attracts crowds who stick around to toss some coin at the casino. And so Trump is always provoking fights: with his opponents, with protesters, with the media, with Twitter critics, with anyone and everyone who irritates him. Distraction is essential to any casino. You want bright lights and noisy machines, free drinks and sexy waitresses. You want fancy palaces with shimmering chandeliers. You want the customer paying attention to everything except the fact that it's all a giant, flashy scam. As the slogan of the Trump Taj Mahal says, 'Excitement Returns.” Distractions make people more willing to gamble. In an environment of calm analysis, rational thinking tends to prevail. 
Trump explained his approach to The Apprentice: 'I rant and rave like a lunatic and the crazier I am, the higher the ratings.” This is also Trump's approach to his presidential campaign, because it is his way of life. 
Casinos are a legal con. The gamblers always lose, collectively, and everyone knows that. But individuals can sometimes win. The key for any casino is to convince gamblers to imagine that they will be the exception to the odds. They don't even have to believe something so irrational is likely, they just have to hope. 
Trump is gambling on the idea that he can convince the voters that the world they live in is a rigged game. They keep trying to play fair, and they get screwed. Trump is promising to play this rigged game, but says he will rig it on behalf of America. Nobody thinks Trump is an honest person; but the more he lies, the more his supporters can imagine that he's going to lie for us. He's going to be a lying son of a bitch, but he will be our lying son of a bitch. He's a con man working for us to take the rest of the world's money after they stole it from us. 
The trick of Trump's con is that he implicitly admits to being a con man. Trump's book, The Art of the Deal, could easily have been titled The Art of the Con. The book is full of examples of how Trump misleads ('truthful hyperbole”) and manipulates people to take advantage of them. Trump has bragged, 'I've taken advantage of the banks probably more than any other human being on earth.” To Trump, conning people is a credential. 
As a con artist, Trump believes in nothing but himself. Only a con artist could propose the largest tax increase on the wealthy in human history just a few years ago and now propose the largest tax cut on the wealthy in human history while simultaneously claiming that he's going to make the rich pay more. Trump will say anything to get elected. 
Trump has only a few consistent positions he has held for decades. Because Trump is a con artist, he will never believe in free trade. The concept of mutually beneficial agreements is alien to him; someone is always taking advantage of someone else in Trump's world. You're either the con artist or the victim. 
The fact that Trump is a con artist does not mean he is plotting as president to steal a trillion dollars and run off to a remote island. Trump, after all, is a narcissist who dreams of being president and imagines himself the greatest leader in history. But Trump can never escape his con artist instincts. He is unable to change, and incapable of self-criticism. He will govern as a con artist, as someone who deceives and manipulates and seeks to control everything around him. As a con artist, Trump imagines that everyone is organizing a con as well, which leads to his conspiratorial thinking. Only the naïve fail to understand they're the victim of a con. 
Casting a vote is as easy as buying a lottery ticket, and it's free, too. Why not take a chance that Trump can deliver what he says, even if you know he can't? The odds are against you, but hope matters more than probabilities. As the Powerball ad slogan says, 'anything's possible.” 
Trump once said, 'My life is like a game of poker.” As a gambler, Trump knows how to take risks with other people's money. But he shows a dangerous tendency to follow instinct rather than reason. The only hope for Trump to emerge victorious is if he can convince the American people to be the same kind of gambler he has been. 
Donald Trump is a pathological liar, a sexist pig, a hateful racist, a corrupt businessman, a pandering populist, a conspiracy nut, and a vicious bully. Trump's cynical narcissism explains why he wants to be president, but his political success reflects much deeper problems in America: the inequality of wealth that makes a man like Trump so powerful, the celebrity-obsessed media that gave Trump an uncritical platform for his ideas, and the failure of our political system to address America's flaws, which has allowed a bigoted demagogue to seize control of the Republican Party.

Chris Hedges and Tavis Smiley Discuss Popular Resistance and the Failure of Mainstream Media Posted on Nov 1, 2016 Chris Hedges speaking to Tavis Smiley via video. (Screen shot via PBS ) 
Last Wednesday, author and Truthdig contributor Chris Hedges joined Tavis Smiley on Smiley's PBS talk show for a conversation about the current election, the impending threat of neoliberalism and the need for popular progressive movements. 
First, Hedges discussed the two main-party candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Hedges said that Trump is 'a man with very little self-control, not much intellectual depth, no real policy experience,” and noted that Clinton is 'a creature of the establishment.” 
He continued: 
She's emblematic of what, again, across the political spectrum, people have risen up against. 
And, therefore, she's a very weak and a very dangerous political figure because as this assault continues on the poor, on working men and women, the shrinking middle class, she will become a lightning rod for this discontent.. 
Smiley asked Hedges, 'So your neoliberal criticism notwithstanding, if she wins with what she interprets as a mandate and you don't think she's qualified to deal with these issues, what say you about how we at least go about holding her accountable?” 
'We have to build popular movements to push back,” Hedges declared, 'because the system itself is not going to respond.” 
The conversation then turned to political representations of popular resistance. Smiley brought up the massive wave of support behind Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, and asked, 'What happens to those Bernie supporters who can't make the turn on November 8?” 
'I am supporting the Green Party,” Hedges replied, 'not because I think they can win, but because I look at Syriza, which is now the ruling party of Greece. Ten years ago, they were polling at four percent. I look at groups like Podemos in Spain. I think we have to build not only alternative movements, but alternative forms of political power to represent our interest.” 
Smiley and Hedges began to wrap up by discussing WikiLeaks and mainstream-media accountability. 'What I have not seen as yet is a robust conversation about how we process what we read from WikiLeaks,” Smiley said. 'Is Secretary Clinton right essentially that we ought to dismiss this and focus on the issue of who is hacking our emails and what it means if a foreign government is doing that?” 
Hedges responded: 
Well, I worked for many decades as a newspaper reporter, including 15 for The New York Times, and I was leaked all sorts of material by the U.S. government, by the French Intelligence Agency, even by the Israeli Mossad. And my job as a reporter was to determine whether the information that I had been leaked was true or untrue and then run it [or not]. 
Now people who leaked me this stuff were not leaking it because they love democracy or an open society. They were leaking it because it was in their interest to leak it. And whoever leaked this to WikiLeaks or wherever they got it, I don't know, but that's not the question. 
The question is, is this true? And it is a look at the inner workings of power, but I think you're right. I think that much of the media has diverted attention from the content of the emails to speculate—and it does appear to be speculation—that this is an attempt by Russia to interfere in our elections. 
Finally, Smiley asked Hedges about the role of the media in the current election. Hedges argued that it was 'deeply irresponsible” for mainstream media to rely on Trump's personality to bring in viewers and higher ratings. 
'Actual discussion of content, of issues that matter to Americans, is very, very rarely heard in the press….The press has failed us on many levels,” Hedges said.

New Reports Link Russia With Donald Trump's Campaign Posted on Nov 1, 2016 Donald Trump at a rally in Nevada. ( Gage Skidmore / CC 2.0 ) 
A trove of new allegations has surfaced suggesting a relationship between Russia and the Donald Trump campaign. 
In this unprecedented election season, the Republican presidential nominee has been accused repeatedly of fostering a friendly relationship with forces within the Russian government, and an adviser to his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, recently suggested that Russia has participated in illicit cyberattacks to further Trump's campaign. 
On Monday, Slate added fuel to the controversy by publishing an investigative piece in which journalist Franklin Foer alleged that a Trump computer server was communicating with an elite Russian bank. Foer wrote: 
The computer scientists posited a logical hypothesis, which they set out to rigorously test: If the Russians were worming their way into the DNC, they might very well be attacking other entities central to the presidential campaign, including Donald Trump's many servers. … 
The researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack. The communication wasn't the work of bots. The irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversation—conversations that began during office hours in New York and continued during office hours in Moscow. It dawned on the researchers that this wasn't an attack, but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the Trump Organization and two servers registered to an entity called Alfa Bank. … 
Tea Leaves [a pseudonym for one of the researchers] and his colleagues plotted the data from the logs on a timeline. What it illustrated was suggestive: The conversation between the Trump and Alfa servers appeared to follow the contours of political happenings in the United States. 
Another article, written by David Corn at Mother Jones on the same day, alleged that a former intelligence officer provided the FBI with information on a Russian scheme to help Trump win the presidency. 
'There's no way to tell whether the FBI has confirmed or debunked any of the allegations contained in the former spy's memos,” Corn wrote. 'But a Russian intelligence attempt to co-opt or cultivate a presidential candidate would mark an even more serious operation than the hacking.” 
Is there any way to substantiate these claims? Vox's Zack Beauchamp argued that while the 'stories are overblown,” Russian interference in the current U.S. election is a serious problem. Beauchamp explained: 
The problem with these stories isn't just that they're speculative. It's that they obscure and even discredit the more sober evidence about Trump's troubling attitude toward the Russian state. 
There is basically conclusive evidence that Russia is interfering in the US election, and that this interference has been designed to damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. There is strong evidence linking Trump's foreign policy advisers to Russia, and Trump's stated policy ideas are extremely favorable to Russian interests. 
Beauchamp listed various 'confluence[s] of interest” between the Kremlin and Trump, pointing to WikiLeaks' release of Democratic campaign emails, Trump's pro-Russia pronouncements and economic ties to Russian interests. 
And NBC reported Tuesday that the FBI has launched a 'preliminary investigation” into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort's possible 'foreign ties” with Russia and Ukraine. The FBI has not commented and Manafort told NBC that 'none of it is true.” 
Vox's Matthew Yglesias also cautioned against getting too excited about the new influx of allegations, writing that 'Trump's policy views on matters related to Russia are a lot clearer than any of these cloak-and-dagger allegations.” 
Eric Lichtblau and Steven Lee Myers of The New York Times asserted, in an article published Monday, that the FBI has not 'found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government.” 
'Intelligence officials have said in interviews over the last six weeks that apparent connections between some of Mr. Trump's aides and Moscow originally compelled them to open a broad investigation ... ,” Lichtblau and Lee Meyers wrote. '[N]o evidence has emerged that would link him or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russia's election operations.” 
The renewed focus on the Trump campaign's relationship with Russia comes as Clinton is again making headlines for her potential misuse of a private email server. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey revealed that another round of emails related to the Clinton campaign is under review. 
While the FBI investigation has not been formally reopened, many Clinton supporters are outraged at Comey's timing, suggesting that his announcement so close to the election violated the Hatch Act . 
With only a week until Election Day, it is unlikely that the accusations on either side will be proven or refuted before voters head to the polls.

Walt Whitman's America Through Edward Weston's Eyes   Jordan Riefe This image, titled 'Woodlawn Plantation House, Louisiana, 1941,” is one of several photographs by Edward Weston on display as part of the Huntington Art Collections' exhibit 'Real American Places: Edward Weston & Leaves of Grass.” (Edward Weston / The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens ©1981 Center for Creative Photography, Arizona Board of Regents 
In the year 1940, publisher George Macy of the Limited Editions Club hit on a brilliant idea for his pricey book line aimed at collectors: a new edition of ' Leaves of Grass ,” poet Walt Whitman's rhapsodic elegy to what Macy called 'the real American faces and the real American places,” illustrated with photos by Edward Weston. Macy's slogan makes a handy title for the new exhibit, ' Real American Places: Edward Weston & Leaves of Grass ” at The Huntington Art Collections in San Marino, Calif. On view through March 2017, it includes roughly half of the 49 photos chosen for the ill-fated edition. 
'Weston never explicitly said he was going to illustrate Whitman,” James Glisson, co-curator of the show with Jenny Watts, told Truthdig. 'He didn't tell Macy until very far into the project.” 
The 54-year-old Weston was coming off a crowning career achievement the same year, the publication of ' California and the West ,” financed through a Guggenheim Fellowship—the first awarded to a photographer. The book represented a departure for Weston, who until then was known primarily as a studio photographer. He had taken his first road trip, covering 23,000 miles with his lover of 10 years, Charis Wilson , 28 years his junior, who wrote the book's highly praised text and became his second wife along the way. 
By May 1941, they were ready to do it again, loading up an eight-cylinder Ford dubbed Walt and setting off from Wildcat Hill, their sanctuary in Carmel, Calif. This journey would cover 20,000 miles through 24 states over eight months, with Macy shelling out for expenses up to $1,000 over six months, including printing and supplies. 
Their first significant stop was Boulder, Colo., where Weston photographed the Boulder (now Hoover) Dam. At a subsequent stop in Port Arthur, Texas, he captured more than a dozen frames of silvery spherical oil tanks. 'California and the West” had featured natural landscapes, but man-made objects now took over his frame. 
The first progress report to reach Macy gave him a real fright. What did otherworldly globes in Texas have to do with Walt Whitman? In his original proposal, Macy requested that Weston 'illustrate every other line in Whitman's poetry,” which, taken literally, would require thousands of photos to match even half the images in the text. 'I hope this is a job which you can tackle quickly,” he added without irony. 
'He's very controlling,” said Watts, who pored through correspondence between the two. 'He comes in with very strong ideas of what he wants. He's not very good at communicating it to the artist. Then he gets very horrified when something comes back that's not what he had envisioned.” 
Although Macy had run into creative differences with artist Henri Matisse while working on another masterpiece dense with illusion, James Joyce's ' Ulysses ,” it would be presumptuous to blame the publisher for the disagreement with Weston. Matisse hadn't bothered to read the book, delivering drawings based on the Greek mythical character instead of Joyce's text, for a price of $5,000. In Weston's case, he 'didn't give a hoot about 'Leaves of Grass'—he was having the time of his life,” according to Wilson's 1998 memoir, ' Through Another Lens .” 
Whitman is mentioned only five times in 230 pages of notes chronicling the journey. Weston explained himself this way: 'My plan for work on this commission was direct: I photographed anything and everything I saw which excited me. I could do no more. Since Whitman's poems cover all walks of life, and every high- and byway, I couldn't easily neglect him.” 
This gave him license to expand his parameters, photographing places and people he was seeing for the first time. Gone are the wide horizons of 'California and the West,” replaced by works of man—a Louisiana church, a bottle farm in Ohio, the Brooklyn Bridge. Each is captured as an item on a list, ordered so as to tell a story, which is similar to how Whitman commonly structured his verse: 
'I believe a leaf of grass is no less than a journeywork of the stars, And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren, And the tree-toad is a chef-d'ouvre for the highest …” 
'There's this idea of movement and journey, one by foot, the other by car, that acts as a temporal element to what they're doing,” Glisson said, completing the parallels between Weston and Whitman.

Battles for Senate Lead to 'Precipitous Rise' in Cloaked Money Spending   Deirdre Fulton / Common Dreams Hey, big spender: The battle for one of Pennsylvania's seats in the Senate pits Republican incumbent Pat Toomey (pictured) against Democratic opponent Katie McGinty in a race edging close to the record for total spending on a campaign for Congress. (Gage Skidmore / Flickr / CC-BY-SA) 
'We have truly crossed a new Rubicon,” one campaign finance expert says in response to new data showing record levels of outside spending pouring into high-stakes Senate races this election cycle. 
According to an analysis released Tuesday by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, outside groups—free from contribution limits and sometimes able to conceal their donors from the public—are outspending both political parties and candidates 'in the battle for control of the U.S. Senate.” 
In fact, of the $557 million spent so far in 10 key Senate contests, the Brennan Center says such groups are responsible for $282 million, or 51 percent. Further, in each of the four most expensive contests—Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Pennsylvania—candidates account for 37 percent or less of total spending. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
'This may be a new high for non-party outside spending, although direct comparisons to past cycles are hindered by a lack of available data,” the report states . 
Brennan Center 
The analysis takes into account 'shadow party groups—super PACs and nonprofits run by former top staff of party committees or party leaders and able to mimic party spending strategy—as nonparty outside groups,” the Brennan Center explains. 'This is because these groups, despite being controlled to some degree by the parties, take unlimited contributions and sometimes hide their donors. That the parties are increasingly outsourcing their finances to unregulated shadow parties severely weakens the campaign finance system's protections against corruption and undue influence.” 
Among the report's other notable findings: 
● GOP winning outside money battle: Nearly 60 percent of the money spent so far in top Senate races supports GOP candidates, a reversal from 2014. Dark money spending, from groups that conceal their donors, favors GOP candidates six to one. 
● Dark money spending is highly concentrated: Just three groups, One Nation, with ties to Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; the Koch network's Americans for Prosperity; and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, account for 67 percent of all dark money spending. 
'The precipitous rise of outside groups is problematic for a few reasons,” said study author Ian Vandewalker, counsel in the Brennan Center's democracy program. 
'Unlike the parties and candidates, they are free to accept donations of unlimited size and can conceal their funders from the public,” he continued. 'So the bigger a role they play in an election, the more political power is concentrated in the hands of a few million-dollar funders and professional political operatives, with a consequent loss in power for the millions of Americans who can't afford jumbo donations. While this problem was created in part by 2010's Citizens United decision , the 2016 data shows we have truly crossed a new Rubicon.” 
To snatch back some of that power, the Brennan Center calls for the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse its damaging decision in Citizens United; for stronger rules against coordination between candidates and outside groups; for improved disclosure and transparency laws; and 'most fundamentally” for a public campaign financing system to 'provide an alternative to the incentives to chase bigger and bigger checks that currently drive political spending, allowing candidates to fund competitive campaigns without relying on the wealthiest donors.” 
Two such public financing systems are on statewide ballots this November. TAGS:

Thomas Frank Explores Whether Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party Will Address Inequality Posted on Nov 1, 2016 
By KiMi Robinson Robert Scheer and Thomas Frank. 
Thomas Frank's writing about electoral politics and and its impact on American culture has been published for decades in places like Harper's Magazine, The Wall Street Journal and his 2004 novel, 'What's the Matter with Kansas?” In his latest book, 'Listen Liberal: Whatever Happened to the Party of the People?” the journalist and political analyst tackles the question of what changed within the Democratic party to make it become a ' liberalism of the rich .” 
'The Democratic Party itself has changed,” Frank told Truthdig Editor in Chief Robert Scheer during an episode of ' Scheer Intelligence ” this year. 'What's changed about them is the social class that they answer to, that they respect, that they come from.” 
The trend has gotten worse. 
'Democrats look at Wall Street, and they see people like themselves,” he said in an interview with Scheer during the Democratic National Convention in July.

On Tuesday night, Frank will join Scheer at the University of Southern California to discuss 'Listen Liberal” and his analysis of Hillary Clinton during this election cycle, from her public views on inequality in United States to her promises to tamp down greed on Wall Street.

In March, Frank summarized his complex investigation of the Democratic Party and the answers he found: 
And you know, we call it inequality; it is the one great problem that we have. And so my, the question in the book is […] the Democrats have been talking about inequality forever. This is why they exist as a party, is to take this on. Why haven't they been able to do anything about it? And the answer isn't what you think. You know, it's not just because Republicans are so diabolically clever and stop them all the time. And it's also not just because of the money that is sloshing around in politics, although that's […] a huge part of the story. But the answer is because the Democrats aren't who we think they are. You know, they talk about inequality, but their heart really isn't in it. Income inequality is really not something that they have cared about for a very long time. You know, there are individuals here and there who do, but you talk about people like the Clintons—I mean, Hillary Clinton, her concern for inequality is, this is, I would say is almost completely feigned.

In Historic First, ICC Preparing to Investigate US War Crimes in Afghanistan   An employee of Doctors Without Borders stands among the charred remains of a hospital hit by a U.S. airstrike in Kunduz, Afghanistan. (Najim Rahim / AP) 
The International Criminal Court (ICC) is preparing to initiate a full investigation into potential war crimes in Afghanistan, including those committed by U.S. military personnel, Foreign Policy exclusively reported Tuesday. 
The magazine writes: 
Multiple sources have indicated that the chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, will seek to initiate an investigation in the coming weeks, likely after the U.S. presidential election but before the end of the year. U.S. officials visited The Hague recently to discuss the potential investigation and to express concerns about its scope. 
A formal investigation of U.S. activities would be the first in the history of the ICC, to which the U.S. is not a party. But because Afghanistan is a member, an investigation is 'certainly possible,” Phyllis Bennis of the Institute for Policy Studies told Common Dreams. 'Afghanistan joined the ICC in 2003, so all actions after that time are subject to ICC jurisdiction,” Bennis said. 
  
'But then you get to the question of political will,” Bennis added. 
The ICC has famously failed to investigate powerful Western nations while prosecuting African dictators, a disparity so glaring that several African countries recently quit the court, condemning it as the 'International Caucasian Court.” 
'Is the prosecutor concerned enough about the accusations of discrimination levied against the ICC that she's willing to go after U.S. clients and U.S. officials?” Bennis asked. 
Rights advocates hope that Bensouda may be willing to take aim at powerful nations. The prosecutor was behind the preliminary ICC report published last year, 'Report on Preliminary Examination Activities,” which suggested that the U.S. was 'responsible for 'physical and psychological' violence and torture that 'debased the basic human dignity' of those detained” in Afghanistan, as Common Dreams reported . 
Indeed, photos released by the Pentagon earlier this year demonstrated the brutal abuse of detainees at the hands of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. 
Bensouda may also probe the deadly bombing by U.S. forces of a Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) hospital in Kunduz, Foreign Policy reports. MSF has characterized the airstrike as a war crime, and rights groups have harshly criticized the Pentagon for its light punishment of those responsible for the attack. 
Despite the looming investigation, Foreign Policy observes that prosecution of U.S. forces for war crimes is still a long way away and may not happen: 
[Prosecution] would require significantly more evidence than the prosecutor's office currently possesses. The ICC normally does not interview witnesses, take testimony, or gather forensic evidence during its preliminary examinations, and that work would be just the beginning. 
In order to charge Americans with war crimes, Bensouda would likely also have to demonstrate a link between the conflict in Afghanistan and U.S. detention policies, which may not be easy; the United States reportedly brought several detainees to Afghanistan from other parts of the world. Perhaps most controversial, the prosecutor's office would have to determine that the United States has failed to address allegations of torture through its own domestic prosecutions, investigations, and reviews. 
Moreover, any indictments related to Afghanistan would be months if not years away. Because no ICC member has referred the situation to the court, Bensouda will need the approval of a three-judge panel before launching an investigation. ICC judges have approved all three previous investigative requests from the prosecutor (in Kenya, Cote d'Ivoire, and Georgia), but their review can take several months, and the judges might request additional information before authorizing an investigation. 
'Still, the readiness of the prosecutor's office to open an investigation represents a sharp setback for President Barack Obama's administration, which has sought several times to discourage an investigation in Afghanistan and even to avoid ICC mention of possible U.S. crimes,” Foreign Policy notes. 
And once an investigation is underway, Bennis noted, the ICC prosecutor will be faced with 'the question of how far up the chain of command do you go.” 
'Do you start and stop with the soldier who tortured and abused detainees? This is what happened with Abu Ghraib,” Bennis explained. 'Individual soldiers were slapped on the wrist. Their commanders who set the standards that said it was okay to humiliate and sexually abuse people, to tie them up naked in a dog collar and take pictures of it—the commander establishes the tone of what their work entailed, but that was never considered.” 
Bennis observed: 'One of the questions that will have to be dealt with by the prosecutor if she decides to go forward is: do you go all the way up? Do you go after George W. Bush for using torture as a part of U.S. strategy? TAGS:

Hezbollah's Candidate Becomes Lebanese President After Sunni Compromise Posted on Nov 1, 2016 
By Juan Cole / Informed Comment 
Lebanon finally has a president, Michel Aoun . In accordance with the country's national pact, he is a Maronite Christian (a Catholic uniate church), and happens to be a former general. The US and Israel won't be pleased that he is a strong ally of the Shiite Hizbullah party-militia and a backer of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. (Most Levantine Christians are either neutral or pro-Assad; virtually none support the Syrian rebels, now mainly fundamentalists). 
Well, Americans who are eager for their own presidential election to be over with should imagine what it would be like for the contest to go on another 2.5 years before it was resolved. That's what Lebanese have had to put up with. Of course, it has a parliamentary form of government, so most power is anyway in the hands of the prime minister and the cabinet. But still and all, not being able to elect a president has been a black mark on the parliament. The parliament, which hasn't been able to supply the Lebanese with water, electricity or garbage collection, and which has twice extended its term of service since 2013, so that it is well past its sell-by date, could hardly take more black marks. 
Lebanon has been deeply polarized since 2004, when it was occupied by thousands of Syrian troops who had originally come during the civil war of 1975-1989. Syria liked the then president, and wanted to see his term extended for three years without a new election, which contravened the constitution. Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri angrily resigned over this Syrian pressure, and then, it is likely, the Syrian secret police or a Lebanese client of same, blew Hariri up on 14 February 2005. 
Maronite Christians and Sunni Arabs (Hariri was Sunni) then mobilized in vast crowds to demand that Syria withdraw from Lebanon beginning March 14 (which became their name). They were countered by the Shiite Hizbullah, which had demonstrated in favor of Syria on March 8. But in the end Syria couldn't stay, and withdrew its troops. 
In a great irony, one of the demands of March 14 was that Gen. Michel Aoun be allowed to return to Lebanon, which he did. But after a while he left the coalition and allied instead with Hizbullah and Syria. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Politics in Lebanon is kaleidoscopic. 
In the past nearly two and a half years, Hizbullah has been trying to get Aoun elected. But the election of the president is by parliament and it needs a 2/3s majority to prevail. Anti-Hizbullah forces just stayed away from scheduled votes and denied the chamber a quorum. There are 128 members of parliament ordinarily, but one resigned last year and so there are only 127 (since no new parliamentary elections have been held since 2013). On Monday, Aoun fell short of the required 86 votes for a 2/3s majority on the first ballot. After that, the candidate could be elected with a simple majority. The next two votes were voided because they turned up 128 ballots, meaning someone voted twice. On the fourth ballot the box was brought in the center of the parliamentary chamber and a close eye was kept on it, so only 127 votes were cast. Aoun received well over the required majority at that point, with 83 votes. Another 36 protest votes were case blank, and 7 were voided because of unspecified irregularities. 
Aoun succeeded because he was not boycotted by the Future Bloc of Saudi-backed Sunni politician Saad Hariri (son of the slain former PM). Hariri had had his own candidate, Sleiman Frangieh, who, however, is just as pro-Syrian as Aoun. 
Hariri used to be fabulously wealthy (his father had worked in Saudi Arabia and built the family fortune there), but the rumors are that his wealth is largely gone. He has had trouble paying his employees, from all accounts. Saudi Arabia considers Lebanon to be too pro-Iranian, and cut it off from a $3 bn grant, and Hariri had depended deeply on Saudi backing. He faces opposition in his own party. So some analysts (see the al-Jazeera clip below) think that Hariri has been so weakened that he finally agreed to let Aoun become president. 
Aoun's platform is strengthening the Lebanese army to fight ISIL and al-Qaeda and doing something about the burden of 1.5 million Syrian refugees (Lebanon is only a country of 4 million). 
His election is a win for Hizbullah, his long-time ally, but since Hariri joined in backing him, it isn't really a loss for the Sunni Arabs of Lebanon, who may be making their peace with the likelihood that the al-Assad regime will survive in some form. Lebanon's Sunnis had strongly supported the Syrian revolution of 2011 and after, and tend to be favorable toward the remnants of the Free Syrian Army. But many of them have to be concerned about the influence among the rebels of an al-Qaeda-linked group, the Levantine Conquest Front, and the continued challenge of Daesh (ISIS, ISIL). Both al-Qaeda and Daesh had footholds in Syrian villages along the Lebanese border. 
Aoun says his first order of business is to have parliament change the country's unwieldy electoral law, which distributes seats on a sectarian basis (and on the basis of an outdated set of statistics going back in some cases to the 1930 census). 
Lebanon held successful municipal elections last spring. But most Lebanese are not holding their breath that governmental gridlock will end any time soon. And with Depression-style unemployment, the country has other problems than the political ones. TAGS:

Stanford Rape Survivor Pens Moving Essay About Life After the Trial Posted on Nov 1, 2016 
By Kali Holloway / AlterNet Valeri Pizhanski / CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 
It is impossible to fully express the devastation of sexual assault in words. But for millions who read the 'victim impact statement” written by Emily Doe, the pseudonym used by the 23-year-old woman at the center of the Stanford rape case, the letter was a powerful recounting of the pain, anguish, anger, sadness, and strength of a rape survivor. Doe's message went viral; as Glamour magazine notes, four days after it was publicly released it 'had been viewed 11 million times; it was read aloud on CNN and the floor of Congress.” 
Brock Turner, Doe's attacker, was sentenced to a mere six months in jail. He ultimately served just three. The glaring injustice in the case, as in so many cases of rape and sexual assault, made Doe's words resound even more loudly. Citing the importance of her message, Glamour magazine named Doe a Woman of the Year, and published her incredibly powerful followup essay. 
'From the beginning, I was told I was a best-case scenario,” Doe writes. 'I had forensic evidence, sober un­biased witnesses, a slurred voice mail, police at the scene. I had everything, and I was still told it was not a slam dunk. I thought, if this is what having it good looks like, what other hells are survivors living? I'm barely getting through this but I am being told I'm the lucky one, some sort of VIP. It was like being checked into a hotel room for a year with stained sheets, rancid water, and a bucket with an attendant saying, No this is great! Most rooms don't even have a bucket.” 
Despite all that, Turner would receive a slap on the wrist. Doe writes of how stunned she was by the leniency Judge Aaron Persky showed the rapist.

'[W]hen it was quickly announced that he'd be receiving six months, I was struck silent. Immediately I felt embarrassed for trying, for being led to believe I had any influence. The violation of my body and my being added up to a few months out of his summer. The judge would release him back to his life, back to the 40 people who had written him letters from Ohio. I began to panic; I thought, this can't be the best-case ­scenario. If this case was meant to set the bar, the bar had been set on the floor.” 
Just one day after the sentencing, Doe was contacted by Buzzfeed with a request to publish her statement. She agreed. Doe could not have expected the overwhelming response; she received an outpouring of thanks from people around the world who were moved by her words. 
'I started getting e-mails forwarded to me from Botswana to Ireland to India,” Doe writes. 'I received watercolor paintings of lighthouses and bicycle earrings. A woman who plucked a picture of her young daughter from the inside of her cubicle wrote, This is who you're saving. ” 
She goes on to point out that blaming victims—suggesting women should get better at avoiding being raped, instead of telling rapists not to rape—is not a real solution. Dismantling rape culture starts with recognizing that rapists are responsible for rape, and demanding justice for survivors. 
'If you think the answer is that women need to be more sober, more civil, more upright, that girls must be better at exercising fear, must wear more layers with eyes open wider, we will go nowhere.” Doe writes. 'When Judge Aaron Persky mutes the word justice, when Brock Turner serves one month for every felony, we go nowhere. When we all make it a priority to avoid harming or violating another human being, and when we hold accountable those who do, when the campaign to recall this judge declares that survivors deserve better, then we are going somewhere.”

Mainstream Presidential Polls Fuel Illusion That Voters Are Stuck With Only Two Choices   
By Meleiza Figueroa go digital / CC BY-SA 2.0 
Editor's note: Meleiza Figueroa is the press director for the Jill Stein-Ajamu Baraka campaign and a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Berkeley. She is a longtime activist and organizer in California. 
Corporate media are focused on Donald Trump's accusations of 'oversampling” on the part of Democrats against Republicans. He's half right, because polls do oversample declared Democrats by up to 14 percent in polls that compose the RealClearPolitics average . 
The deeper story is that mainstream polls skew against youth and independents, who are undersampled in most polls up to a whopping 30 percent. A recent CNN poll sampled few people under the age of 50. Not one major poll lists alternative-party identification in the breakdown of its sample. 
The first problem with sampling involves definitions. Most polls sample 'likely voters,” with a bit of expansion to count for a smattering of 'registered voters.” So who are 'likely voters”? Voters who (1) consistently vote—which automatically excludes people ages 18 to 22, who have no voting history, (2) identify with either of the two major parties and (3) say that they intend to vote in the next election. 'Registered voter” polls don't count first-time voters not yet registered to vote, so forget about the opinions of those college students who are signed up in enthusiastic campus get-out-the-vote drives. 
  
The questions asked in the polls reinforce established, dualistic views of the political spectrum. The presidential-preference questions in polls that deign to include Green Party nominee Jill Stein and Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson don't ask 'Who is the candidate you want to vote for?” or 'Which candidate is most aligned with your positions and values?” Nearly all the polls frame the presidential question as 'If the election were held tomorrow, who would you vote for?” In a media landscape where we are told—through unbalanced news coverage , controlled debates and ceaseless cultural propaganda, down to the red and blue cups at 7-Eleven stores during election season—that only the Democratic and Republican candidates are considered viable, most people will, of course, hold their noses and vote for the lesser of two evils. It's telling that the very next follow-up question reads, 'If the election were ONLY held between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, who would you vote for?” You might as well reword the questions to (1) 'Which candidate do you think will win?” and (2) 'Which of these two candidates do you hate the least?” Neither of these questions address the issue of who people want to be their next president. 
The rest of the questionnaires wipe alternative candidates off the map completely. Third-party candidates are treated as if they don't exist—while the approval ratings for the two parties in government and Congress as a whole are hovering around historic lows . What we can glean from the polls is that it's clear people want change, but what kind of change they want is of no concern to the pollsters. 
We did get a sample of the earth-shaking hunger for change during the 2016 primaries when the votes for Bernie Sanders turned the polling orthodoxy upside down. The most famous example was Sanders' 21-point, poll-defying upset in the Michigan primary . The wild cards in this case were—you guessed it— independent and young voters , who turned out in droves in Michigan, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and other open-primary states to deliver a giant middle finger to the establishment candidate. 
No one really knows how large the 'Bernie or Bust” crowd is, but what we do know is that the floodgates opened during the tragic circus of the Democratic National Convention, and progressive Berniecrats began to burn Green. #Demexit became a trending hashtag on social media, and a recent nationwide survey of Sanders delegates found that 33 percent intend to vote for Stein . 
Everywhere the Stein-Baraka campaign goes, we find an ever-growing base of support—not just among former Sanders supporters, but also among those 'unlikely” voters who are underrepresented in polls: young people, Independents and people of color. These are all the demographics, when broken out in mainstream polls, that go about 4 percent to 10 percent higher for Stein. These voters compose a potentially game-changing, awakening 'sleeping giant” that has the establishment working overtime to impose a media blackout on a third-party alternative. 
The corporate media have shown themselves willing to lock out alternative parties. In fact, a recent video of a CNN focus-group taping caught them in the act. When a fair number of participants identified their preferences as Johnson or Stein, the scene was promptly reshot to exclude these choices, portraying these voters as 'undecided.” 
In this election year—when the largest voting block of registered voters are independents , and many people (especially millennials, lower-income voters and people of color) are fed up with the two-party system—the means of taking a temperature check on the state of our democracy denies a voice to those who choose to reject the establishment duopoly. Only 9 percent of Americans chose Clinton and Trump to be the major-party nominees, which puts a whole lot of people in a big margin of error. 
A voter revolt could be happening right under our noses, but the establishment and their pollster apparatchiks don't want you to notice. They want to maintain the illusion that voters are stuck with only two choices, a trap that the majority of Americans who want another major party are trying to escape.

Unthinkable Politics and the Bodies of Children   
By Henry A. Giroux / Truthout Bo / (CC BY-ND 2.0) 
As the distinction between the truth and lies fades in public life, politics appears to be increasingly emptied of any substance. As Lucy Marcus has observed , 'Nowadays, facts and truth are becoming [more] difficult to uphold in politics (and in business and even sports).” Certainly, in the age of Trump there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that the appeal to reason, informed judgment and facts is at odds with the current political culture. That is, truth and evidence have gone the way of the electric typewriter, or so it seems. 
Americans seem to have a growing fondness for ignorance, an attitude that reinforces the downsizing of the civic function of language. Falsehoods and deceptions no longer appear marginal to political debate but now seem to shape much of what is said by the presidential candidates. This is shockingly true for Trump, who has organized much of his campaign around endless fabrications, sending fact checkers into a frenzy of activity. When Trump is caught in a falsehood, he simply ignores the facts and just keeps on lying. His followers could care less about whether he deceives them or not. 
On the other hand, Hillary Clinton has earned a reputation as a chameleon, willing to say almost anything to promote her political career, regardless of whether she sacrifices the truth in order to do so. Her email scandal is largely read as symptomatic of a more pronounced and deeper level of dishonesty. Consequently, she is viewed mostly by the general public as untrustworthy. In response, she has managed her truth deficit by invoking her lifelong defense of families and children. For instance, during the second debate she claimed she wanted 'America to be for our children” and attempted to bolster her concern for the welfare of children by pointing to her early work with the Children's Defense Fund. In the third presidential debate, she argued against Trump's call for exporting 11 million immigrants by stating that she was against his deportation policies because she 'didn't want to rip families apart [and was against] sending parents away from children.” In her political television ads, she points to supporting policies that 'will invest in schools and colleges [and will work to] develop an economy where every young American can find a job and start a family of their own.” 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Unfortunately, Clinton only focuses on managing some of the problems that young people face, rather than doing anything to change the conditions that produce them. For instance, she says nothing about what education should accomplish in a democracy when educational policies are driven by a neoliberal economy that she supports. And while she talks about providing jobs for young people, she has little to say about transforming rather than adjusting an economy marked by wide gaps in inequality, wealth and power. 
Matters of power, state violence, extreme poverty, institutional racism, a broken criminal justice system, the school to prison pipeline and the existence of the mass incarceration state, among other important matters, rarely if ever enter her discourse and yet these are major issues negatively affecting the lives of millions of children in the United States. And her alleged regard for children falls apart in light of her hawkish policies on global regime change, drone attacks and cyber-warfare, and her unqualified support for the warfare state. Her alleged support for children abroad does not capture the larger reality they face from when their countries are invaded, attacked by drones and subject to contemporary forms of indiscriminate violence. Rather than critique the US as a powerful engine of violence, Clinton expands its imperialist role around the globe. This is a key point in light of her defense of the rights of children, because her warmongering ideology puts children in the path of lethal violence. 
At the same time, Clinton's promise to address the problems many children face in the United States reeks of a disingenuousness made visible by her history of siding with and supporting policies that were injurious to children. Not only did she once disparagingly call young people super-predators, but as the First Lady she strongly backed her husband's campaign to 'end welfare as we know it.” President Clinton's welfare policies did great harm to poor children. They eliminated the Aid to Families with Dependent Children federal assistance program and infuriated Marian Wright Edelman, the president of the Children's Defense Fund, to the degree that she ended her working relationship with Hillary Clinton. According to Edelman , the bill represented a frontal assault on the well-being of poor children and families. Yet as late as 2008, Hillary was still touting this pernicious welfare bill as a success. She also supported Bill Clinton's 'tough on crime” policies, which, according to Michelle Alexander , 'resulted in the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history”—which has a devastating effect on the families and children of color. Finally, Clinton supported Bush's invasion of Iraq, which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children. 
Occupying the right wing of the Democratic Party, Clinton has aligned herself with a war culture that supports drone warfare and continues to support military policies that result in the needless deaths of millions of children in the Middle East, Yemen, Somalia, and other places that bear the brunt of America's foreign policy. It is difficult to imagine, given Clinton's coziness with the financial elite, big corporations, the military-industrial complex and the reigning war culture, that she will do anything that will lessen the violence to which children, both at home and around the globe, will face under her potential reign as President of the United States. Clinton has nothing to say about the need for a collective struggle for economic and political justice. Given her past history, Clinton's disingenuousness becomes even starker next to the images of war and violence that mark the bodies of youth both in the United States and abroad. Her commitments to war and security have been built on the misery, mutilation and deaths of young people and her recent alleged support for the welfare of children does little to cover up the many ways capitalism, militarism, state violence and racism are killing poor Black and Brown youth. 
Rethinking the Horrors of War 
The horrors of war became painfully visible when the image circulated of the lifeless body of Aylan (Alan) Kurdi, a three-year-old who washed up on a beach face-downin the coastal town of Bodrum, Turkey, on September 2, 2015, while traveling with other refugees toward the Greek island of Kos. A second haunting image appeared on August 17, 2016, showing five-year-old Omran Daqneesh, bloodied and covered with dust, sitting silently in an ambulance after an airstrike on Aleppo, a city in northern Syria.

Arctic Warming Gives U.S. and Europe the Chills   
By Tim Radford / Climate News Network A cold New York winter. Research shows there could be much worse to come. (Gregory Tran via Flickr) 
LONDON—Warming in the Arctic—one of the fastest-warming regions on the planet—could be heightening the chances of extreme winters in Europe and the US. As the Arctic warms, the stratospheric jet stream that brings occasionally catastrophic ice storms and record snow falls to the eastern United States could also be on the move, according to new research in the journal Nature Climate Change . The phenomenon is a natural one. Some years the track of the jet stream is wavy, and delivers severe cold weather to the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere. Some years the pattern alters, and Europe in particular experiences mild winters. The temperate zones have always experienced occasional extremes. But climate change could be tilting the balance. Extreme spells 'We've always had years with wavy and not so wavy jet-stream winds, but in the last one or two decades the warming Arctic could well have been amplifying the effects of the wavy patterns. 'This may have contributed to some recent extreme cold winter spells along the eastern seaboard of the United States, in western Asia and at times over the UK,” says Edward Hanna , a geographer at the University of Sheffield, UK, and one of a team of British, European and US scientists behind the study. 'Improving our ability to predict how climate change is affecting the jet stream will help improve our long-term prediction of winter weather” The study doesn't claim to settle the question: notoriously, climate is what you expect but weather is what you get, and it may be impossible to prove that this or that unexpected event happened because the global average temperatures are now at least 1°C higher than they used to be, before the human combustion of fossil fuels began to increase the concentration of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from 280 parts per million to 400 ppm. But there are changes in the Arctic that are happening because of global warming, and meteorologists have been watching the knock-on effect on the stratospheric winds, especially the jet stream. In the same issue of the journal one group identified a persistent shift and a weakening in the Arctic winter polar vortex , a meteorological monster that plays a role in temperate zone weather patterns. Others identified a link between Arctic changes and the speed of the jet stream, and its effect on transatlantic airline timetables . Yet others have linked Arctic warming to dangerous extremes of heat further south , and yet another group has linked polar climate change to both ice storms and heatwaves . Arctic signals The debate continues. The important thing is to monitor the melting sea ice, the rising sea-surface temperatures and the emerging pattern of severe winter weather. If meteorologists can learn to read the signals from the Arctic, then communities could plan more effectively for the consequences. 'Improving our ability to predict how climate change is affecting the jet stream will help improve our long-term prediction of winter weather in some of the most highly populated regions of the world,” Professor Hanna says. 'This would be highly beneficial for communities, businesses and entire economies in the northern hemisphere. 'The public could better prepare for severe winter weather and have access to extra crucial information that could help make life-saving and cost-saving decisions.”

Reinventing Democracy in America Starts by Voting, Then Building an Accountability Movement Posted on Nov 2, 2016 ( The Prophet / CC BY-SA 2.0 ) 
Voting is supposed to be a constitutional right in the United States. But the sad truth is that voting is a privilege . This reality has been made colder since the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013. 
Steps have been taken to curtail the impact of that decision— Shelby County v. Holder —on the 2016 general election, but voter discrimination still exists. Some Americans have fewer rights than others. Compare minorities, the poor, immigrants, felons, ex-convicts and the elderly with well-off whites, the educated and so-called 1 percenters. Whose voices do you think are heard more? The current system has been designed to maintain the status quo and keep the disenfranchised from changing their status. Discriminatory voting laws compound the problem . 
  
According to the Brennan Center for Justice, new voting restrictions are in place in 14 states this year: 'The new laws range from strict photo ID requirements to early voting cutbacks to registration restrictions. Those 14 states are: Alabama, Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin.” 
Voter suppression is nothing new. In the latest issue of The New Yorker, Caleb Crain provides a history lesson in ' The Case Against Democracy ”: 
In the United States, élites who feared the ignorance of poor immigrants tried to restrict ballots. In 1855, Connecticut introduced the first literacy test for American voters. Although a New York Democrat protested, in 1868, that 'if a man is ignorant, he needs the ballot for his protection all the more,” in the next half century the tests spread to almost all parts of the country. They helped racists in the South circumvent the Fifteenth Amendment and disenfranchise blacks, and even in immigrant-rich New York a 1921 law required new voters to take a test if they couldn't prove that they had an eighth-grade education. About fifteen per cent flunked. Voter literacy tests weren't permanently outlawed by Congress until 1975, years after the civil-rights movement had discredited them. 
The article reviews a new book called 'Against Democracy,” by Jason Brennan, a political philosopher at Georgetown University who argues for 'epistocracy,” a word (coined by another political philosopher, David Estlund of Brown) that means 'government by the knowledgeable.” Brennan believes that uninformed voters do more damage than good, so decision-making should be left to the informed. In other words, voting should not be a duty for all. 
That's a radical idea. But in a way, such thinking aligns with how the Founding Fathers viewed the electorate, Crain acknowledges. He cites a warning from James Madison: 'There are particular moments in public affairs, when the people, stimulated by some irregular passion, or some illicit advantage, or misled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men, may call for measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn. In these critical moments, how salutary will be the interference of some temperate and respectable body of citizens, in order to check the misguided career, and to suspend the blow meditated by the people against themselves, until reason, justice, and truth can regain their authority over the public mind?” 
Madison wrote those words (under the pseudonym Publius) for Federalist No. 63 —an essay that was part of The Federalist Papers—to explain the concept of the United States Senate. He went on to say: 
The people can never willfully betray their own interests; but they may possibly be betrayed by the representatives of the people; and the danger will be evidently greater where the whole legislative trust is lodged in the hands of one body of men, than where the concurrence of separate and dissimilar bodies is required in every public act. 
The difference most relied on, between the American and other republics, consists in the principle of representation; which is the pivot on which the former move, and which is supposed to have been unknown to the latter, or at least to the ancient part of them. ... 
In the most pure democracies ... many of the executive functions were performed, not by the people themselves, but by officers elected by the people, and representing the people in their executive capacity. 
... 
Besides the conclusive evidence resulting from this assemblage of facts, that the federal Senate will never be able to transform itself, by gradual usurpations, into an independent and aristocratic body, we are warranted in believing, that if such a revolution should ever happen from causes which the foresight of man cannot guard against, the House of Representatives, with the people on their side, will at all times be able to bring back the Constitution to its primitive form and principles. Against the force of the immediate representatives of the people, nothing will be able to maintain even the constitutional authority of the Senate, but such a display of enlightened policy, and attachment to the public good, as will divide with that branch of the legislature the affections and support of the entire body of the people themselves. 
Here's another radical idea: Instead of having only a few informed people make decisions for everyone, how about we make everyone informed by providing the same, free educational opportunities for every U.S. citizen? 
Over the 240 years of the American experiment, the nation has moved away from its early ideals. Democracy has been corrupted, becoming the perverted form of corporatocracy and plutocracy we now have. The only way we can fix the defects in our system is by voting in principled leaders, then insisting they follow through on what they promise. If they do not, we must vote them out and put people in power who do. 
Start in your own community. It will require some sacrifice. 
Lee Ellis knows about all about sacrifice . He spent five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. He has written two books on honor, ' Engaging With Honor ” and ' Leading With Honor .” He has not lost faith in the United States and believes voting is a key to restoring honor to America. 
'When you become indifferent and refuse to stand up for your ideas, you forfeit and must live by the ideas of others,” Ellis told Truthdig in a telephone interview. 'You are making a choice to let someone else make your choice for you. And I think that is a terrible way to live. We cannot afford to be indifferent about these key decisions. Evaluate the risk of the candidates. There are no risk-free choices. We're always taking a risk. Which is the most likely to pursue the principles that you feel are important?” 
Apathy is no longer an option. It's not too late for America, but we have to act fast. Now is no time to be timid. 
Look at the water protectors in Standing Rock in North Dakota. They are putting their lives on the line for us, our planet, the fate of generations. If you are a responsible U.S. citizen who cares about the future of our world, you have a role in our survival. That starts by voting. To be a responsible voter requires being informed. You don't have to have a Ph.D. in political science or be the political equivalent of Ralph Nader . Anyone can know something . Everyone can do something . 
Research the candidates. Read up on ballot initiatives. Learn about down-ticket races. Check your sources—make sure they are trustworthy. Share what you know (in a respectful way) with friends and family and on social media. Encourage others to do the same.

One Veteran's War on Islamophobia Posted on Nov 2, 2016 
By Nate Terani / TomDispatch JMacPherson / (CC-BY-2.0) 
I'm not an immigrant, but my grandparents are. More than 50 years ago, they arrived in New York City from Iran. I grew up mainly in central New Jersey, an American kid playing little league for the Raritan Red Sox and soccer for the Raritan Rovers. In 1985, I travelled with my family to our ancestral land. I was only eight, but old enough to understand that the Iranians had lost their liberty and freedom. I saw the abject despair of a people who, in a desperate attempt to bring about change, had ushered in nationalist tyrants led by Ayatollah Khomeini. 
What I witnessed during that year in Iran changed the course of my life. In 1996, at age 19, wanting to help preserve the blessings of liberty and freedom we enjoy in America, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Now, with the rise of Donald Trump and his nationalist alt-right movement, I've come to feel that the values I sought to protect are in jeopardy. 
In Iran, theocratic fundmentalists sowed division and hatred of outsiders—of Westerners, Christians, and other religious minorities. Here in America, the right wing seems to have stolen passages directly from their playbook as it spreads hatred of immigrants, particularly Muslim ones. This form of nationalistic bigotry—Islamophobia—threatens the heart of our nation. When I chose to serve in the military, I did so to protect what I viewed as our sacred foundational values of liberty, equality, and democracy. Now, 20 years later, I've joined forces with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred values, this time right here at home. 
'Death to America!” 
  
As a child, I sat in my class at the international school one sunny morning and heard in the distance the faint sounds of gunfire and rising chants of 'Death to America!” That day would define the rest of my life. 
It was Tehran, the capital of Iran, in 1985. I was attending a unique school for bilingual students who had been born in Western nations. It had become the last refuge in that city with any tolerance for Western teaching, but that also made it a target for military fundamentalists. As the gunfire drew closer, I heard boots pounding the marble tiles outside, marching into our building, and thundering down the corridor toward my classroom. As I heard voices chanting 'Death to America!” I remember wondering if I would survive to see my parents again. 
In a flash of green and black uniforms, those soldiers rushed into our classroom, grabbed us by our shirt collars, and yelled at us to get outside. We were then packed into the school's courtyard where a soldier pointed his rifle at our group and commanded us to look up. Almost in unison, my classmates and I raised our eyes and saw the flags of our many nations being torn down and dangled from the balcony, then set ablaze and tossed, still burning, into the courtyard. As those flags floated to the ground in flames, the soldiers fired their guns in the air. Shouting, they ordered us—if we ever wanted to see our families again—to swear allegiance to the Grand Ayatollah Khomeini and trample on the remains of the burning symbols of our home countries. I scanned the smoke that was filling the courtyard for my friends and classmates and, horrified, watched them capitulate and begin to chant, 'Death to America!” as they stomped on our sacred symbols. 
I was so angry that, young as I was, I began to plead with them to come to their senses. No one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet, for the first time in my life, I felt something like righteous indignation. I suspect that, born and raised in America, I was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that I just couldn't fathom the immense danger I was in. Certainly, I was acting in ways no native Iranian would have found reasonable. 
Across the smoke-filled courtyard, I saw a soldier coming at me and knew he meant to force me to submit. I spotted an American flag still burning, dropped to my knees, and grabbed the charred pieces from underneath a classmate's feet. As the soldier closed in on me, I ducked and ran, still clutching my charred pieces of flag into a crowd of civilians who had gathered to witness the commotion. The events of that day would come to define all that I have ever stood for—or against. 
'Camel Jockey,”'Ayatollah,” and 'Gandhi” 
My parents and I soon returned to the United States and I entered third grade. More than anything, I just wanted to be normal, to fit in and be accepted by my peers. Unfortunately, my first name, Nader (which I changed to Nate upon joining the Navy), and my swarthy Middle Eastern appearance, were little help on that score, eliciting regular jibes from my classmates. Even at that young age, they had already mastered a veritable thesaurus of ethnic defamation, including 'camel jockey,”'sand-nigger,”'raghead,”'ayatollah,” and ironically, 'Gandhi” (which I now take as a compliment). My classmates regularly sought to 'other-ize” me in those years, as if I were a lesser American because of my faith and ethnicity. 
Yet I remember that tingling in my chest when I first donned my Cub Scout uniform—all because of the American flag patch on its shoulder. Something felt so good about wearing it, a feeling I still had when I joined the military. It seems that the flag I tried to rescue in Tehran was stapled to my heart, or that's how I felt anyway as I wore my country's uniform. 
When I took my oath of enlistment in the U.S. Navy, I gave my mom a camera and asked her to take some photos, but she was so overwhelmed with pride and joy that she cried throughout the ceremony and managed to snap only a few images of the carpet. She cried even harder when I was selected to serve as the first Muslim-American member of the U.S. Navy Presidential Ceremonial Honor Guard . On that day, I was proud, too, and all the taunts of those bullies of my childhood seemed finally silenced. 
Being tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me. It caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people. Somehow, I grasped that, if it weren't for a fear of the unknown, there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me. Often, I discovered, those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families, friends, or even strangers. I realized, then, that if, despite everything, I could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness, I might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me, too, and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate. 
Through patience, humor, and understanding, I was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the 'otherness” of so much that Americans found scary. To this day, I have friends from elementary school, middle school, high school, and the military who tell me that I am the only Muslim they have ever known and that, had they not met me, their perspective on Islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fear-based narrative that has poisoned this country since September 11, 2001. 
In 1998, I became special assistant to the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy and then, in 1999, I was recruited to serve atthe Defense Intelligence Agency. In August 2000, I transferred to the Naval Reserve.

DOJ Agrees: North Carolina Counties Are Purging Black Voters From the Rolls Posted on Nov 2, 2016 
By Nadia Prupis / Common Dreams Thousands gathered in Raleigh, North Carolina on Feb. 13, 2916 for the Moral March, which took up voting rights as one of the day's key issues. The NAACP is now arguing that North Carolina counties cancelled or rejected approximately 4,500 registrations, primarily affecting eligible black voters. (Susan Melkisethian / Flickr)( CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 ) 
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) this week issued a statement of interest agreeing with civil rights advocates in North Carolina that the massive Republican-led purging of voter rolls in the state counts as a violation of federal law. 
The statement, issued late Monday in response to the North Carolina NAACP's emergency lawsuit filed earlier that day, agreed with the plaintiffs that thousands of registrations had been wrongfully challenged in violation of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), which states that voters may not be removed from the rolls unless they have been absent for two or more cycles or given written confirmation that they have moved. 
A Winston-Salem court is hearing the NAACP's case Wednesday. In issuing the statement, the DOJ could help provide the court with a framework for assessing the plaintiffs' claims that at least three counties—Beaufort, Cumberland, and Moore—had cancelled or rejected approximately 4,500 registrations, primarily affecting eligible black voters. The department occasionally files statements of interest to express its views on cases where it is not a party.

'The purge program at issue here rested on a mass mailing and the silence of voters largely unaware of the potential injury to their voting rights. A perfunctory administrative proceeding to consider evidence produced by a mass mailing does not turn an otherwise prohibited systematic process into an 'individualized' removal,” the statement read. 
The suit is asking that wrongfully canceled registrations be restored and that no more names are removed from the lists. 
NAACP president Rev. William Barber II said Monday, 'This is our Selma and we will not back down and allow this suppression to continue.” 
'The Tar Heel state is ground zero in the intentional, surgical efforts by Republicans to suppress the voice of voters,” he said. 'We're taking this emergency step to make sure not a single voters' voice is unlawfully taken away.” TAGS:

The Clintons and Trump in the New York of the One Percent Posted on Nov 2, 2016 Hillary and Bill Clinton smile outside. ( Karen Murphy / (CC BY-ND 2.0) ) 
In an essay in The New York Times Magazine, columnist Maureen Dowd sheds light on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's climb through New York's high society. 
'We are in the final days of the first presidential contest between two New Yorkers in 72 years,” Dowd writes. 'On election night, the party and the wake will both be held in Manhattan. Hillary will hold hers at the Javits Convention Center, with its literal glass ceiling”. 
Dowd examines the Clintons' move from Washington D.C. to New York after Bill left the presidency: 
With Hillary's Senate bid underway, the Clintons held out their tin cup. They had been fund-raising in the city nonstop since 1990, but the asks intensified as they started their foundation in 2001 and rubbed shoulders with all the new wealth on Wall Street, which was driven by hedge funds and technology funds. With book deals and lucrative speeches and Bill's role as an adviser to Ronald Burkle's private-equity firm, Yucaipa, the Clintons worked their way out of the debt accrued by legal bills from a cascade of federal investigations to earn an estimated $230 million in the next 15 years. 
As the Clintons fashioned a new life in New York, Trump was transforming himself as well — from a risk-taking developer facing bankruptcy to a low-risk licenser of his name for other people's projects, from a brazen builder to a gilded reality-TV star on 'The Apprentice.” He had come out of Queens, a pushy New York kid with family money but no social tools to climb the society ladder. 'Even stuck out on Avenue Z, his head was always in Manhattan,” says Wayne Barrett, author of the biography 'Trump: The Greatest Show on Earth.” Gwenda Blair, author of 'The Trumps,” says Trump, resplendent in the '70s in his three-piece burgundy suit with matching shoes and matching limo, recalled 'this strapping lad from the provinces who comes to the city, like a figure out of Balzac's 'Lost Illusions.'?” 
The New York society scene was set by the Rockefellers and the Astors with a tradition of civility, philanthropy and the arts at its heart. Even those who make money the rough way — especially them — adopt this genteel facade. Michael Bloomberg is the quintessential emblem of this model and Donald Trump is the quintessential raspberry to it. One top New York foundation official who requested anonymity — many people will only speak anonymously about the Trumps and the Clintons, because both clans are known to be vindictive — notes that 'in the community of plutocrats and superachievers who come to New York, Donald Trump is seen as persona non grata. He's not a civic leader.” New York, this person says, is a place where private-equity C.E.O.s like Henry Kravis and Stephen Schwarzman see themselves making commitments to the public good. Their status doesn't come only from being in charge of powerful corporations. 'It also comes from some attachment to a hospital or university or cultural center. Trump was never part of that ecosystem.” When the tightfisted Trump hosts a charity event for veterans or a charity golf tournament, it is dismissed as something to polish the Trump brand. Trump has turned off many people in the worlds of real estate, banking and law with his strong-arming, fee-shaving or stiffing, bankruptcies and litigiousness. 'Most real estate guys won't go near him,” a leading New York financial executive says. 'You lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas.” 
Trump thumps his chest about money, acting as if he's Bloomberg-wealthy, while the Clintons pretend they have less than they do. Trump wants to belong, to get more legitimacy by elbowing his way into the power crowd, while the Clintons passed that threshold of belonging after two terms in the White House. A top media mogul dismisses all three as outsiders: 'No one here thinks of the Clintons as New Yorkers, and Donald is a bridge-and-tunnel person. He's always been a poseur in New York.”

The Secret Cost of Chinese Buffets: Part 1 Posted on Nov 2, 2016 
By Amelia Pang Workers prepare for business at a restaurant in the Chinatown section of Los Angeles on Jan. 19, 2012. ( Jae C. Hong / AP Photo ) 
Wang's Employment Agency is nestled on the third floor of a barbershop in Flushing, N.Y. No sign outside suggests its existence. Inside, there is an undecorated, white-walled office where a dozen middle-aged Chinese immigrants sit and wait in nervous silence. Wang, the owner of the agency, is a heavyset woman in her early 50s. She snacks on walnuts from a Styrofoam cup as she considers people's job requests. 
'I have a job as a cook at a Vietnamese restaurant,” she tells a man in his 50s. 
'A Vietnamese restaurant?” he asks. 'But I've never had Vietnamese food.” 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
'It's just noodles,” Wang says. 'They use a different sauce than we do. That's all. Give them a call and try it out for a day.” 
He pays Wang $60 for the job offer. I catch the tail end of this conversation. It is not clear where the restaurant is located. 
'Were you smuggled in?” Wang asks me. 
'No,” I say. 
I was born and raised in Maryland. My Mandarin has a noticeable American accent. I later realize it was a mistake to admit my legal status. Wang asks me a few questions about what type of restaurant jobs I want. She says she'll call me if anything comes up. 
She doesn't call. Wang isn't alone. Other employment agencies in Flushing I contact also do not return my calls after hearing my Mandarin. 
Chinese restaurants hire undocumented Chinese and Latino workers, pay them well below minimum wage, make them work 12-hour shifts six days a week but offer free housing and food. These workers are packed at night into roach-infested apartments and houses. Sometimes they are forced to sleep on cardboard in the basements of restaurants. They make $800 to $2,000 a month—regardless of how many hours they work. 
Much of their pay goes to fees charged by traffickers and smugglers—known in Chinese as 'snakeheads”—and to private employment agencies such as the one run by Wang that charges clients for finding them a job. The smugglers, like the agencies, do not advertise. Snakeheads charge $60,000 to $80,000 to smuggle someone into the United States. They have networks of enforcers, which means that, if you do not pay, you or your family members in China will be subject, until the money is paid, to beatings or even death. 
Restaurant jobs in big cities fill up fast. There are more immigrants looking for work in cities, where wealthier customers tip generously. Most employment agencies in Flushing specialize in sending immigrants to jobs in remote towns where Chinese restaurants are often short of staff. Once offered a job, an immigrant often has to be on a bus within hours and can find him- or herself halfway across the country. 
My legal status and my American-accented Mandarin are impediments. Labor trafficking, which can take place before the immigrant is smuggled into the country, is dependent on the powerlessness of the worker. Snakeheads routinely lie about jobs, wages and employment conditions, knowing that once workers are in the United States they are unable to appeal to law enforcement. It is also common for snakeheads and employers to confiscate passports and identity documents in order to hold workers hostage. 
These snakeheads do not only traffic in Chinese workers. They routinely 'buy” undocumented Latino workers who have crossed into the United States from Mexico and drive them to Chinese restaurants around the country where they, too, are held in bondage. Those who traffic human beings also often traffic drugs, carrying narcotics along with their human cargo across state lines. 
'Employment agencies buy Mexicans at the border from smugglers and sell them to Chinese employers,” said a former snakehead I'll call Edward, whom I interviewed in Atlanta. For one year, the First Street Employment Agency paid Edward $2 per mile to pick up undocumented Latino immigrants from Fort Myers, Fla., and drive them to the agency in Chamblee, Ga. The employment agency owner would pack the Latino migrants into crowded rooms in a nearby apartment complex called the Don Juan Duplexes while he waited for Chinese restaurant owners to purchase the immigrants like indentured servants. 
'Chinese restaurant owners don't pay Mexicans for the first two months of work. They pay the smugglers instead,” Edward told me. 'They pay $1,000 per person, maybe $1,200 per person, to the smuggler.” 
After two months, restaurant owners typically begin to pay new Latino workers $800 a month. They tend to work in the kitchen, so they don't receive tips. In busy restaurants, experienced kitchen workers might eventually make up to $2,000 a month. 
The employment agencies, Chinese restaurants and human smugglers have informal ties to one another, which makes it efficient to supply cheap labor but difficult to prosecute. Most of these labor agencies are never charged with trafficking. 
I change my tactics when I enter Min Du Employment Agency on Eldridge Street in Manhattan's Chinatown. The agency's office is not much larger than a walk-in closet. A poster plastered on the wall advertises a $30 bus ride to Indiana. 
'Hello, little sister,” an elderly woman greets me in Mandarin from behind the counter. The small space behind her counter is stuffed with notebooks, instant-noodle packs and an electric kettle. 
I speak haltingly. I give vague answers about my ability to speak English. She doesn't ask about my immigration status. 
I tell her I'm looking for a busgirl job. I decide on busgirl because I have limited Chinese writing skills and would struggle to write orders down in Chinese. 
'The closest job is four hours away,” she says. 
'That's fine,” I say. 
She begins calling restaurant employers across North America and mumbles a few words to them before handing me the receiver. I get on the phone with a Chinese restaurant owner in Indiana.

Dakota Access Pipeline CEO Kelcy Warren Should Face the Music Posted on Nov 2, 2016 
By Amy Goodman and Denis Moynihan A Dakota pipeline protester recovers after being pepper sprayed by police near Cannon Ball, N.D. ( John L. Mone / AP ) 
President Barack Obama foreshadowed more complications for the Dakota Access pipeline this week, as he told an interviewer that 'right now the Army Corps is examining whether there are ways to reroute this pipeline.” With hundreds arrested in recent weeks at the Standoff at Standing Rock, North Dakota, the movement to halt construction of this 1,200-mile, $3.8 billion oil pipeline only builds. Musicians are increasingly joining the fray, striking an unexpected chord: pressuring oil billionaire Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, which owns the pipeline. Warren also owns a small music label and recording company , and is the founder and driving force behind the Cherokee Creek Music Festival in Texas. Many musicians, including folk/rock legend Jackson Browne, are banding together to confront Warren and help stop the pipeline. In a statement published in September by Indian Country Today Media Network, Jackson Browne wrote: 'I met Kelcy Warren on one occasion, when I played at the Cherokee Creek Music Festival, held at his ranch. Later his company, Music Road Records, produced an album of my songs. Though I was honored by the 'tribute' and think highly of the versions—which were done by some of my favorite singers and songwriters, I had nothing to do with producing the recordings or deciding who would be on it.” Jackson continued: 'I do not support the Dakota Access pipeline. I will be donating all of the money I have received from this album to date, and any money received in the future, to the tribes who are opposing the pipeline.” The album Browne referenced is titled, 'Looking Into You: A Tribute to Jackson Browne.” Emily Saliers and Amy Ray, better known as the folk duo the Indigo Girls, have been to the Standing Rock resistance camps, where thousands have been facing off against an increasingly violent, militarized police force that is facing down the Native American water protectors with attack dogs, armored personnel carriers, pepper spray, concussion grenades and deafening acoustic cannons. In addition to raising awareness and funds for the land and water protectors at Standing Rock, the Indigo Girls are organizing musicians to challenge Kelcy Warren directly. 'Kelcy Warren also happens to be a passionate music lover and owns a festival, Cherokee Creek music festival,” they wrote in a recent Facebook post. 'Indigo Girls have played the festival and had a song on the [Jackson Browne] tribute record. When we participated in those events, we had no idea about Kelcy Warren's connection to big oil and its imminent threat to the Standing Rock Sioux. Now we know.” They wrote a letter to Warren, which was co-signed by Jackson Browne, Shawn Colvin, Joan Osborne, Keb' Mo' and others. It read, in part, 'We realize the bucolic setting of your festival and the image it projects is in direct conflict with the Dakota Access pipeline ... this pipeline violates the Standing Rock Sioux Nations' treaty rights, endangers the vital Missouri River, and continues the trajectory of genocide against Native Peoples.” The letter concluded, 'We will no longer play your festival or participate in Music Road Records recordings. We implore you to stop construction of the Dakota Access pipeline.” Kelcy Warren is a Texas oil billionaire several times over, and might not be easily deterred by a threatened boycott. In fact, when global oil prices began dropping, 'Nobody was happier about the crash than Energy Transfer Chairman and CEO Kelcy Warren,” Bloomberg Markets reported. All his competition, Warren gloated, 'vaporized.” He, like many analysts, anticipates that oil prices will rise, fracking in the Bakken shale region will boom again, and his Dakota Access Pipeline will be the only conduit to carry the crude oil to the Texas Gulf Coast for refining and export. 'You must grow until you die,” Warren told Bloomberg. Jackson Browne also wrote in his statement: 'I intend to support public resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline as much as I can. To quote a song of mine: 'Which side? '—the corporations attacking the natural world, drilling and fracking, who do it with the backing of the craven and corrupt? '—Or the ones who fight for the earth with all their might, and in the name of all that's right, 'Confront and disrupt?'” In the press release about the Jackson Browne tribute album from Music Road Records, Kelcy Warren wrote, 'I don't know of anybody that admires Jackson more than me.” As Browne and other musicians rally with the land and water protectors at Standing Rock, and as President Obama signals post-election action on the pipeline, it's time for Kelcy Warren to face the music.

$23 Save America From Donald Trump to Fix America, or, Did Your Mother Drop You on Your Head? Posted on Nov 2, 2016 
By Juan Cole / Informed Comment 
When I trained as a lifeguard they warned us that you have to be very careful how you approach a drowning victim flailing around. They will be so happy to be rescued that they will grab you and pin your arms and freeze up, and then you'll both sink to the bottom and drown. You have to keep your distance, keep your arm stiff, and pull them out straight on their back, head out of the water, to reassure them. Then you can rescue them. The rescued teenager may not be a saint. Or they may have a bad family situation. You're not thinking about that when the issue is whether they will live or die. Maybe they can straighten out their lives if they end up having lives. 
So America is drowning, and voting for Hillary Clinton is the equivalent of rescuing it. It is the stiff arm to deal with a hysteria that will otherwise sink us. 
I see too many people agonizing over this election. Will they vote for the Greens? Libertarians? Is Hillary as bad as Trump? 
Did your mother drop you on your head? This is a drowning country we're talking about. You don't have the luxury to sit on the beach and decide whether to go in. And maybe you'll be delivering the country to someone who is a bad mother. But it will be a live country and maybe the mother could be reformed. Drowned people can't be reformed. Remember when, in Princess Bride, Inigo Montoya brings Westley to Miracle Max (Billy Crystal) to be brought back from the dead? And Miracle Max discovers Westley isn't dead, and so could be revived: 'Mostly dead is slightly alive. With all dead, well, with all dead there's usually only one thing you can do.” Inigo Montoya : 'What's that?” Miracle Max : 'Go through his clothes and look for loose change.” 
An America under Trump would be all dead. Donald J. Trump is the greatest danger to American democracy in modern history. He openly menaces journalists, he keeps inquiring about why we have nukes if we can't use them, he wants to steal Iraq's petroleum wealth, he promises to use torture, he courts the KKK, he proposes tax and other policies that will vastly increase inequality and bankrupt the government, and he wants a trade war with China. I could go on with a litany of fatal 'policies” (actually more like wicked quips) all the way down the page (and blog pages don't really have a fixed bottom). All this is not to mention his criminal notion that he has a right to French kiss and fondle any woman he can get hold of with his tiny hands.

I think it is entirely possible that if Trump were president, I and other writers and journalists and critics could be targeted for dirty tricks. It happened even under Bush. This is one reason it is so dangerous to have a standing massive domestic surveillance program of our current sort; one election could put it into the hands of a dictator. 
I get it. Hillary is Wall Street. She will do nothing to rein in the excesses of the financiers (and not all financiers need reining in, but many do). One of our country's most pressing problems, wealth inequality, will almost certainly get worse in a Clinton presidency. She probably will continue Obama's phony 'all of the above” energy policy, which will mean an overheated climate (we need a Manhattan project to get off oil, coal and gas immediately). She is a foreign policy hawk and seems committed to intervening in Syria. She is in the back pocket of Haim Saban and the AIPAC Israel lobbies and has a virtual love fest with Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu. 
But here's a surprise. We live in a society dominated by corporations the way medieval Britain was dominated by feudal lords. The only difference is that we have a higher standard of living than did the serfs and we get to decide between two Establishment candidates for high office regularly. 
Over two-thirds of America's $18.5 trillion economy is generated by Fortune 500 big corporations (in 2014 it was 73%!) 
When I was a graduate student 36 years ago it was about 50%. (Small business accounted for most of the other half then, and were the source of the vast majority of innovation). 
Although the corporations and the economists who ultimately actually mostly work for them maintain that this system is efficient and based on competition, in fact there are lots of monopolies or near-monopolies, and it clearly has giant inefficiencies (compare your internet bill to that of people in Europe). They also complain about government regulation, but through lobbying most of them have actually captured the legislators who are supposed to be regulating them. Often they write the laws for the legislators and just have the latter sign them. 
The corporations don't always get their way. But they most often do. It would have cost them trillions of dollars in profits if the US had moved quickly to green energy in the 1990s when the climate crisis first became apparent, so they waged a PR campaign to smear climate scientists like Michael Mann and pull the wool over the eyes of most consumers to keep them burning coal, gas and oil as long as possible. In the US alone, they managed to put on the order of an extra hundred billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in the past 20 years through this dishonest ruse. It's like blowing up billions of atomic bombs, making the earth hotter and hotter. No one has been president who would have stood in their way, and almost nobody has been allowed in Congress who would obstruct them either. They are starting to give up on coal, and Obama did stab them in the back on that fuel, but they still burn as much gas and oil as they like and flare up methane when they frack both, destroying the environment (not to mention water pollution). I say 'they' because there are essentially interlocking directorates. A lot of the Fortune 500 is heavily invested in hyrdocarbons. That is why it is so hard to do environmental investing, because if you buy a bank stock you are buying Exxon-Mobil.There isn't any more pressing issue than addressing climate change, and I'm sorry but nothing Hillary has said about the issue is actually ambitious enough to fit the scale of the emergency. 
So I know. 
But you aren't thinking about this right. The people screwed over by the 1% are hurting and have turned to Trump because he talks like a maverick, even though he will screw them over even harder. They are drowning. 
You can't rehabilitate the patient if the patient drowned. And America would drown, would be all dead, would be beyond redemption, under 4 years of Trump. 
Sec. Clinton is from that generation of baby boomer Democrats who decided in the Reagan era that they had to become Eisenhower Republicans ever to hold office. So she surrendered to Wall Street & etc. We know that. But she can be pressured, just as Eisenhower was pressured (if only we could get back to his tax policies!) We can oppose her if she drags her feet on key issues. It will be easier to pressure her from below if we can also take back Congress and can get some liberals on the Supreme Court. 
We can't oppose Trump because he has made it clear that he will rule as dictator and will brook no opposition. He has lots of goons to sic on his critics already, and would pick up their entire Federal government if he wins. 
I have made my peace with being a serf who gets to vote for the candidates the two parties (mainly representing the corporations) present me with. (It is a first past the post system, so creating a 3rd party is almost impossible). It is a very corrupt system, maybe the most corrupt on earth . I'll probably never see a president who really represents the mainstream of America, because of voter suppression and big money in politics and the corruption of corporate media. I blow off my frustrations at this blog and maybe I change a few minds here and there. Civil disobedience seems increasingly called for with regard to hydrocarbons. But we can't do that if America is dead. And Clinton won't kill it, however wrongheaded some of her announced policies. We survived Bush, though with a $6 trillion bill, and we can survive Clinton. We can't survive Trump. TAGS:

Geo-Engineering Unlikely to Work, Conservation Group Says Posted on Nov 3, 2016 
By Alex Kirby / Climate News Network Biofilm used in research into carbon capture: Doubts persist about geo-engineering. (ENERGY.GOV via Wikimedia Commons) 
LONDON—The global watchdog responsible for protecting the world ' s wealth of species, the UN ' s Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), has looked at the hopes for reining in climate change through geo-engineering. Its bleak conclusion, echoing that reached by many independent scientists, is that the chances are 'highly uncertain”. 'Novel means”, in this context, describes trying to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by removing them from the atmosphere, and altering the amount of heat from the Sun that reaches the Earth. Some scientists and policymakers say geo-engineering, as these strategies are collectively known, is essential if the world is to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement . This is because current attempts to reduce emissions cannot make big enough cuts fast enough to keep global average temperatures from rising more than 2°C above their pre-industrial levels, the Agreement's basic goal. But the CBD says in a report that geo-engineering, while it could possibly help to prevent the world overheating, might endanger global biodiversity and have other unpredictable effects. Many independent analysts have raised similar concerns.Attempts to increase the amount of carbon in the oceans, in order to remove GHGs, have so far shown disappointing results. One report doubted that geo-engineering could slow sea-level rise . Another said it could not arrest the melting of Arctic ice . A third study found that geo-engineering would make things little better and might even make global warming worse . Transboundary impacts The lead author of the CBD geo-engineering report is a British scientist, Dr Phillip Williamson, of the UK's Natural Environment Research Council . He is an associate fellow in the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia , UK. The CBD originally became involved in climate geo-engineering in 2008, because member governments were concerned that experiments to fertilise the oceans could pose unknown risks to the environment (they were then unregulated when carried out in international waters). The CBD's concern expanded to include other geo-engineering techniques, especially atmospheric methods which could have uncertain transboundary impacts. Some scientists argue that 'geo-engineering” is a hazily-defined term and prefer to speak instead simply of 'greenhouse gas removal”. Dr Williamson and his colleagues say assessment of the impacts of geo-engineering on biodiversity 'is not straightforward and is subject to many uncertainties”. On greenhouse gas removal they warn that removing a given quantity of a greenhouse gas would not fully compensate for an earlier 'overshoot' of emissions. New risks In some cases, they say, the cure may be worse than the disease: 'The large-scale deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) seems likely to have significant negative impacts on biodiversity through land use change.” When it comes to attempts to reflect sunlight back out into space or to manage solar radiation, a familiar theme recurs: 'There are high levels of uncertainty about the impacts of SRM [solar radiation management] techniques, which could present significant new risks to biodiversity.” Time and again, it seems, a potential advance is liable to be cancelled by an equally likely reverse: if SRM benefits coral reefs by decreasing temperature-induced bleaching (as it may), in certain conditions 'it may also increase, indirectly, the impacts of ocean acidification.” There could even be a risk in some circumstances of loss to the Earth's protective ozone layer. Dr Williamson and his colleagues believe that geo-engineering is essential—if it can be made to work—because of the diminishing chances that anything else will. 'I'm sceptical. That's not to say bio-energy with carbon capture and storage is impossible, but it seems extremely unlikely to be feasible” They write: 'It may still be possible that deep and very rapid decarbonisation by all countries might allow climate change to be kept within a 2°C limit by emission reduction alone. However, any such window of opportunity is rapidly closing.” Repeatedly, those two words recur: a suggested technique or development will be 'highly uncertain”. Most of the report amounts to a very cautious call for more research, coupled with an implicit acceptance that in the end geo-engineering is unlikely to prove capable of contributing much to climate mitigation. Dr Williamson told the Climate News Network: 'I'm sceptical. That's not to say bio-energy with carbon capture and storage is impossible, but it seems extremely unlikely to be feasible (for all sorts of reasons)” at the scale needed. When the CBD member governments meet in December they are expected to call for more research: a safe option in most circumstances, but far from a ringing endorsement of a technology once seen as very promising.

Donald Trump, the Greatest Victim in the History of the World Posted on Nov 3, 2016 
By Ann Jones / TomDispatch ( Gage Skidmore / (CC BY-SA 2.0) ) 
Donald Trump grabbed a new lifeline. Speaking at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, on October 15th, he raised a hand as if to take an oath and declared : 'I am a victim!” The great business tycoon, the one and only man who could fix America and make the place great again (trust me, folks), was laying claim to martyrdom—and spinning another news cycle. 'I am a victim,” he declared, 'of one of the great political smear campaigns in the history of our country. They are coming after me to try and destroy what is considered by even them the greatest movement in the history of our country.” 
'I am a victim.” That pathetic line echoed in my head, which is why I'm writing this. In my long life, I had seen a large white man stand up in a public arena and proclaim those words—the shrill, self-pitying complaint of the remorseless perpetrator—only once before. That was in a courtroom in lower Manhattan in 1988. The man was Joel Steinberg , a New York lawyer who, over a 12-year period, had brainwashed and beaten into oblivion a woman named Hedda Nussbaum, once a successful young editor of children's books. In the early years of their relationship, she had run away several times, seeking help, and every time a doctor or friend had called Steinberg to come and get her. At that point—time and again—Steinberg would administer 'punishment,” breaking her bones and her spirit. She took on what police would later describe as 'a zombie-like quality.” 
Some years earlier, a teenage girl had hired Steinberg to arrange an adoptive home for her baby. Instead he kept the child, Lisa, until one evening when she was six years old and 'stared” at him in a way he didn't like. He responded by striking her repeatedly in the head. After which he went out to dinner with his cocaine dealer, leaving the child unconscious on the floor. Nussbaum, by then so traumatized, so absent from anything like life, thought vaguely of calling a doctor, but she was not allowed to use the phone in Steinberg's absence. Instead, she sat on the floor and watched over the girl as she lay dying. 
On trial for the child's murder, Steinberg blamed everyone but himself. 'I'm the victim here,” he whined in court. He swore that he had 'never hit anyone,” not anyone , even though he was known to have assaulted a business associate and three other women before he settled into the single-minded, single-handed demolition of Hedda Nussbaum. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Judge Harold Rothwax observed that Steinberg was 'a man of extraordinary narcissism and self-involvement” who had 'an extreme need to control everyone in his ambit” while he lived a 'life of self-gratification.” Yet Steinberg could not see in himself the man Judge Rothwax described. He thought people should feel sorry for him. He had been disbarred and had lost a child (not to mention his Greenwich Village apartment). He railed at those who had conspired to bring him down: the police, the neighbors, the judge, the prosecutor, the expert medical witnesses, his defense attorney, the jurors, the press, and Hedda Nussbaum. 'I'm the victim here,” he claimed. 
At the time, nearly 30 years ago, the public blamed Hedda Nussbaum. The district attorney, the police, the doctors and psychiatrists who treated her intensively for more than a year before the trial all agreed that, on the evening in question, she was too physically and mentally 'incapacitated” either to cause the girl's injuries or take action to save her. Nonetheless, she was tried and condemned by the press and public opinion, including women who called themselves 'feminists.” In court, the jurors were merciless. When they began to deliberate, only four thought Steinberg guilty of murder as charged, five were 'in the middle,” and three held out for lesser charges, feeling certain that Hedda Nussbaum had somehow been responsible for killing the child. 
They finally agreed upon a verdict of manslaughter. Even then, a woman juror assured the press that Nussbaum was 'a very sick woman” who should have been charged and convicted of 'some crime.” Another juror, also female, expressed popular opinion this way: 'I just feel that she was to blame.” And a third woman juror, who claimed that 'certain others” agreed with her, said, 'Poor Joel. Joel's a victim. We have to send a message to the system: 'You don't make victims out of nice men like Joel.'” 
Judge Rothwax sentenced Steinberg to eight and a half to 25 years. Released after 17 years, Steinberg, now in his seventies, still claims to have done nothing hurtful to anyone. He has not paid a civil court-ordered settlement of $15 million to the birth mother of the dead child, nor has he ever been charged with any crime for what he did to Hedda Nussbaum. 
Two lessons lurk in this story, one old and one very up to date. First, it's a reminder of how much women at that time, even after a great wave of feminism, still blamed women (including themselves) for whatever happened to them at the hands of men; second, a man with a character like Steinberg's is not the kind of guy you want to choose for high office—or any office at all. 
Joel Steinberg stalked a far tinier stage than Donald Trump and he did more deadly damage, but the two men seem to be brothers under the skin, sharing common character defects well described in psychiatric texts: extreme narcissism, a taste for sexual predation, and very similar views of the women on whom they prey. Like Steinberg, who was incapable of seeing himself as the judge accurately described him, Trump seems blind to the real nature of his own behavior. (His current wife describes him as a 'boy.”) Neither man seems capable of taking responsibility for the harm he's done, and when their own actions finally call down retribution, branding them as losers—ah, then come the conspiracy theories and the vindictive wail of the victim. 
Men Who Use Women 
Last June, I published a piece at TomDispatch venturing to explain why candidate Donald J. Trump was getting 'rock-bottom ratings” in the polls from women voters. Nearly 70% of them reportedly couldn't stand the guy. I pointed out what seemed to me to be the obvious: 'Trump's behavior perfectly fits the profile of an ordinary wife abuser.”

Without Bold Agenda, Warn Progressives, A Clinton Presidency Won't Stand Chance Posted on Nov 3, 2016

While the whole country appears to be on edge ahead of next week's presidential election, the Left is 'increasingly confident” that, should a Hillary Clinton presidency come to pass, the Democratic nominee won't be able to turn her back on progressive campaign promises—as many argue President Barack Obama did—because she will need that grassroots support if she hopes to stay in office beyond four years. 
'If she wants to be more than a one-term president, she's going to have to work with the left. Period,” Murshed Zaheed, political director of CREDO, told The Hill for a new report published Thursday. 
Speaking with progressive activists, The Hill reports that the Left is entering a post-election season 'emboldened and empowered,” and ready to fight for implementation of the Democratic platform, said to be the most progressive in the party's history. 
And unlike Obama, a hypothetical President Clinton won't be in a position to attempt a ''post-partisan' approach to seeking deals with Republicans.”

'We're hoping that she will be smart enough to know that if she were to go that route…there's going to be a political price to pay for it, because it will demoralize her base heading into 2018 and, honestly, it may even jeopardize 2020,” said Zaheed. 
Ben Wikler, Washington director at MoveOn.org, predicted that the Democratic party is potentially moving 'from an electoral storm into a governance storm.” 
Clinton, Wikler told The Hill , 'will find 'tremendous grassroots support if she goes to the mat' for her liberal campaign platform. And if she doesn't, those same grassroots liberals are 'emboldened and empowered' and 'ready to hold her to account.'” 
And Clinton seems to be aware of this dynamic. 
Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), points to the fact that the Clinton campaign has Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as well as her former primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) aggressively campaigning on her behalf the last full week before the election, with stops in a number of pivotal battleground states. 
And while both are doing all they can to ensure that her presidential rival, Republican nominee Donald Trump, is not elected, Green is hopeful that the two progressive firebrands will provide ''a pre-emptive chilling effect on bad behavior' if she does win the presidency,” The Hill reports. 
Indeed, Sanders has said that he intends to 'leverage” the popularity he gained during the primary to ensure that Clinton enacts the party agenda and does not nominate the 'same old, same old Wall Street guys” for regulatory positions. 
And emails from Clinton's campaign chair John Podesta recently leaked by WikiLeaks illustrated how she sought Warren's approval and support. In one instance, her staff expressed concern that the by opposing a new Glass-Steagall Act, Clinton would appear too pro-Wall Street and thus 'antagonize and activate Elizabeth Warren.” 
Progressive leaders, including Sanders and 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben , have vowed that there will no honeymoon period for the centrist Democrat, should she be elected—and campaigners say that Clinton would be wise to heed their advice and go for those 'big, bold ideas,” like tuition-free college, a higher minimum wage, a just transition to renewable energy, and Medicare for all. 
As Green told The Hill , Clinton's success will be largely determined by two factors: How aggressively she pushes the progressive party platform in the first 100 days of her presidency and how effectively she rallies public support for those policies. 'The absolute best way to get something done is to push big, bold ideas, get the public on your side and force Republicans to the table,” Green said. If she adopts that strategy, 'the Republicans will cave,” Green said. 'It's just that simple.”

Battle Over Dakota Access Pipeline Should Be the Most Important of the Year Posted on Nov 3, 2016 
By Sonali Kolhatkar A protester against the controversial Dakota Access pipeline project takes a stand before law enforcement officers Oct. 27 as police and other forces attempt to force activists from a camp set up in the path of pipeline construction near Cannon Ball, N.D. ( James MacPherson / AP Photo ) 
More than a million people around the U.S. have ' checked in ” via Facebook to Standing Rock Indian Reservation in Cannon Ball, N.D. While this began as an attempt to confuse Morton County Sheriff's Department officials thought to be digitally surveilling activists, the check-ins morphed into a collective gesture of solidarity. They are also a measure of how deeply the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's fight over the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL) resonates with the American public. A similar measure is apparent in how crowd-funding campaigns set up by activists have far outpaced their funding goals— one effort to raise $5,000 ended up generating more than $1 million. Americans who are unable to physically lend their support are eager to participate in some way in the struggle against the pipeline that one New York Times op-ed writer equates with the Keystone XL pipeline fight . 
The DAPL conflict is symbolic of so many wrongs and is at the intersection of so many issues that it is no wonder it is shaping up to be the most important contemporary struggle in the U.S. It embodies, in particular, the historic mistreatment of Native Americans, as well as their ongoing efforts to preserve their sovereignty. It is also a matter of environmental racism, given that the pipeline is routed under the water source of a vulnerable minority. Short-term pollution from pipelines and other oil infrastructure, as well as the longer-term pollution of greenhouse gases that affect the climate, are also part of the DAPL story. 
In the massive police response against protesters, we are seeing horrifying examples of police brutality and witnessing how state power protects private commercial interest and preserves corporate domination over people. This has engendered domestic solidarity from the Black Lives Matter movement, labor groups and others who consider it a common struggle, as well as international solidarity offered by oppressed communities, such as Palestinians. Many threads are coming together to weave a tapestry of struggle. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
The fight to stop the DAPL is a perfect storm of issues, a convergence of ills that represents so much of what is wrong with American society that needs desperately to be fixed. A growing list of celebrities—including actors Shailene Woodley, Mark Ruffalo and Chris Hemsworth, as well as musicians Neil Young and Dave Matthews—are lending their star power to the cause and turning their fans on to it. 
The fact that our elected officials are so deafeningly silent on this crucial struggle is exactly why many Americans are disillusioned by our electoral system. GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has said nothing about the pipeline project, perhaps because he has numerous business interests tied to it. But Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who ought to be a natural ally to the 'water protectors,” as they refer to themselves, had to be shamed into issuing a statement. Indigenous youths from various tribes occupied her campaign office in Brooklyn, N.Y., recently to demand she take a stand against the pipeline. When she issued a statement , it was a meaningless request that 'all voices should be heard and all views considered.” Her campaign chairman, John Podesta, spouted similar nonsense in a recent interview, saying, 'I think she believes that stakeholders need to get together at this point. ... It's important that all voices are heard.” 
Similarly, President Obama, who seems to have very little to lose by stopping the project voluntarily halting its project. The company, obviously, did not comply. However the President did suggest in open letter to Obama , calling on him to 'take a bold stand” against the project. 
It's not just most elected officials and candidates running for office who are silent. Mainstream corporate media outlets have only recently begun covering the protests at Standing Rock, although they began in April. In September, the media watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting called out TV networks for their 'blackout” of the story. Even with increased media coverage, there has been little focus from traditional media outlets on police brutality against water protectors and journalists and the extreme felony charges many of them are facing.

Tired of Waiting' for Politicians, Voters Put Minimum Wage on Ballot in Four States Posted on Nov 4, 2016 
By Lauren McCauley / Common Dreams 'We all know that our economy is broken. We have seen that elected officials are just failing to do anything about it,” said Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of The Fairness Project. (Wisconsin Jobs Now/cc/flickr) 
Voters, 'tired of waiting” for federal lawmakers, will soon be casting their ballot in Arizona, Colorado, Maine, and Washington to raise the grossly inadequate minimum wage and, advocates hope, raise the standard of living for roughly 2.1 million Americans. 
While none of the four ballot measures goes so far as to call for the $15 an hour wage that has been the rallying cry of the low wage worker movement and which became a pillar of Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, the initiatives signify a determination among Americans that it is high time to demand 'an economy that can work for everyone.” 
'We all know that our economy is broken. We have seen that elected officials are just failing to do anything about it,” said Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of The Fairness Project. 'The best way for us to make the changes that impact working Americans immediately is not to wait for politicians to figure this out but for us to support ballot measures that allow voters to speak out.” 
Thus far, polls in all four states show that voters believe a wage increase is 'long overdue and desperately needed,” added Schleifer, whose organization helped launch and finance the ballot measures. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
'We are confident that when working Americans see raises in their paychecks even before the next President is inaugurated,” he said, 'the success of these measures will inspire even more ballot initiatives in the coming years.” 
Arizona Proposition 206 
A 'yes” vote on Proposition 206 , known as the Fair Wages and Healthy Families Initiative, would raise the state's minimum wage from $8.05 to $10 in 2017, and then incrementally to $12 by 2020. It also establishes the right to paid sick time off from employment. 
Recent polling by Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News found that roughly 58 percent of voters support the measure, with 31 opposed, and another 10 percent still undecided. 
'Enthusiasm for Proposition 206 has only gotten stronger over the course of this election season,” Bill Scheel, campaign manager of Arizona Healthy Families , the organization behind Proposition 206, said in a Wednesday press call. 'Over the past three months, we have registered 150,000 new voters. Already, early vote numbers are showing that these Arizonans are crucial to raising wages for nearly a million workers in our state.” 
The initiative has the support of a number of labor unions, family support groups, as well as the state Democratic party. 
'No one who works 40 hours a week should have to live in poverty and decide between buying groceries, medicine, or paying the bills. Raising the minimum wage offers hardworking families the opportunity to put food on the table, care for their children, and creates a better future for our state,” said U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D-1), who is running against incumbent Sen. John McCain (R) for his seat in the U.S. Senate. 
McCain opposes the measure, as do corporate lobby groups and the Chamber of Commerce. 
Colorado Amendment 70 
Colorado's Amendment 70 , an initiated constitutional amendment, would raise the minimum wage from $8.31 to $9.30 per hour in 2017 and then increase it 90 cents each year until it reaches $12.00 in 2020. 
September polling found that roughly 58 percent of voters are in support of the measure, while 36 percent are opposed. 'We've known all along that Colorado voters support raising the wage to $12 by 2020 and that for many of them, especially lower income voters and women, they are more enthusiastic voters in this election because of our measure,” said Patty Kupfer, campaign manager for Colorado Families for a Fair Wage , the organization supporting Amendment 70. 
As Kupfer notes, the initiative's primary opponents are industry groups and 'large restaurant chains who have an interest in keeping wages low.” 
Amendment 70 is one of many Colorado ballot measures this year that progressives nationwide are watching, in addition to a measure calling for a single payer healthcare system as well as one that would stiffen requirements for amending the state's constitution, which, as Common Dreams previously reported , 'would transfer power away from voters, making the state more vulnerable to powerful interests.” 
Maine Question 4 
Question 4 on the Maine ballot asks voters if they 'want to raise the minimum hourly wage of $7.50 to $9 in 2017, with annual $1 increases up to $12 in 2020, and annual cost-of-living increases thereafter?” 
The citizen-initiated effort also seeks to raise the wages for tipped workers 'from half the minimum wage to $5 in 2017, with annual $1 increases until it reaches the adjusted minimum wage.” 
A poll conducted between Oct. 20 and Oct. 25 found that 57 percent of Mainers support the wage increase, while just 35 percent oppose it, and eight percent remain undecided. Proponents attribute its wide support to two years of organizing to build grassroots support and 'establish a narrative of an economy that can work for everyone, as Mike Tipping, communications director with Mainers for Fair Wages , the organization supporting Question 4, put it in a recent press call. 
Noting that the measure has strong support 'across every demographic,” including among small businesses and restaurants, Tipping said he's 'proud to see this enthusiasm translate into more young people voting and more Mainers voting early to raise the minimum wage.” 
Washington Initiative 1433 
The most ambitious of the 2016 ballot efforts, Washington State's Initiative 1433 supports incrementally raising the state's minimum wage from $9.47 to $13.50 by 2020 and mandates that employers offer paid sick leave. 
'Paid sick leave and minimum wage are issues that have had a deep effect on working families and drive support for our initiative at the polls,” said Carlo Caldirola-Davis, campaign manager for Raise Up Washington , the organization supporting Initiative 1433. 'Voters understand that hard working Washingtonians should be able to care for their families and make ends meet.” 
The most recent survey from pollster Stuart Elway found that I-1433 is leading 58 to 31 percent, with 11 percent undecided. The initiative has wide support, and has been endorsed by numerous publications, advocacy organizations, labor groups, and public officials, including Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who last spring tweeted: We have to do more to raise wages & support paid leave for hardworking families. I stand with @Raise_Up_WA in their work to do just that. -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 4, 2016 
In 2014, Seattle became the first major city to approve a $15 minimum wage.

How the American Political System Changed and No One Noticed Posted on Nov 4, 2016 
By Tom Engelhardt / TomDispatch Andrew Czap / (CC BY-SA 2.0) 
To say that this is the election from hell is to insult hell. 
There's been nothing like this since Washington forded the Rubicon or Trump crossed the Delaware or delivered the Gettysburg Address (you know, the one that began 'Four score and eleven women ago…”)—or pick your own seminal moment in American history. 
Billions of words, that face, those gestures, the endless insults , the abused women and the emails, the 24/7 spectacle of it all… Whatever happens on Election Day, let's accept one reality: we're in a new political era in this country. We just haven't quite taken it in. Not really. 
Forget Donald Trump. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Doh! Why did I write that? Who could possibly forget the first presidential candidate in our history preemptively unwilling to accept election results? (Even the South in 1860 accepted the election of Abraham Lincoln before trying to wave goodbye to the Union.) Who could forget the man who claimed that abortions could take place on the day of or the day before actual birth? Who could forget the man who claimed in front of an audience of nearly 72 million Americans that he had never met the women who accused him of sexual aggression and abuse, including the People magazine reporter who interviewed him? Who could forget the candidate who proudly cited his positive polling results at rallies and in tweets, month after month, before (when those same polls turned against him) discovering that they were all ' rigged ”? 
Whatever you think of The Donald, who in the world—and I mean the whole wide world (including the Iranians )—could possibly forget him or the election he's stalked so ominously? When you think of him, however, don't make him the cause of American political dysfunction. He's just the bizarre, disturbed, and disturbing symptom of the transformation of the American political system. 
Admittedly, he is a one-of-a-kind 'politician,” even among his associates in surging right-wing nationalist and anti-whatever movements globally. He makes France's Marine Le Pen seem like the soul of rationality and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte look like a master tactician of our age. But what truly makes Donald Trump and this election season fascinating and confounding is that we're not just talking about the presidency of a country, but of the country. The United States remains the great imperial state on Planet Earth in terms of the reach of its military and the power of its economy and culture to influence the workings of everything just about everywhere. And yet, based on the last strange year of election campaigning, it's hard not to think that something—and not just The Donald—is unnervingly amiss on Planet America. 
The World War II Generation in 2016 
Sometimes, in my fantasies (as while watching the final presidential debate), I perform a private miracle and bring my parents back from the dead to observe our American world. With them in the room, I try to imagine the disbelief many from that World War II generation would surely express about our present moment. Of course, they lived through a devastating depression, light years beyond anything we experienced in the Great Recession of 2007-2008, as well as a global conflagration of a sort that had never been experienced and—short of nuclear war—is not likely to be again. 
Despite this, I have no doubt that they would be boggled by our world and the particular version of chaos we now live with. To start at a global level, both my mother (who died in 1977) and my father (who died in 1983) spent decades in the nuclear age, the era of humanity's greatest—for want of a better word—achievement. After all, for the first time in history, we humans took the apocalypse out of the hands of God (or the gods), where it had resided for thousands of years, and placed it directly in our own. What they didn't live to experience, however, was history's second potential deal-breaker, climate change, already bringing upheaval to the planet, and threatening a slow-motion apocalypse of an unprecedented sort. 
While nuclear weapons have not been used since August 9, 1945 , even if they have spread to the arsenals of numerous countries, climate change should be seen as a snail-paced version of nuclear war—and keep in mind that humanity is still pumping near-record levels of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. I imagine my parents' amazement that the most dangerous and confounding issue on the planet didn't get a single question , not to speak of an answer, in the three presidential debates of 2016, the four and a half hours of charges, insults, and interruptions just past. Neither a moderator, nor evidently an undecided voter (in the town hall second debate), nor either presidential candidate—each ready to change the subject on a moment's notice from embarrassing questions about sexual aggression, emails, or anything else—thought it worth the slightest attention. It was, in short, a problem too large to discuss, one whose existence Donald Trump (like just about every other Republican) denies, or rather, in his case, labels a 'hoax” that he uniquely blames on a Chinese plot to sink America. 
So much for insanity (and inanity) when it comes to the largest question of all. On a somewhat more modest scale, my mom and dad wouldn't have recognized our political world as American, and not just because of Donald Trump. They would have been staggered by the money pouring into our political system—at least $6.6 billion in this election cycle according to the latest estimate, more than 10% of that from only 100 families. They would have been stunned by our 1% elections ; by our new Gilded Age ; by a billionaire TV celebrity running as a 'populist” by riling up once Democratic working-class whites immiserated by the likes of him and his 'brand” of casino capitalism, scam, and spectacle; by all those other billionaires pouring money into the Republican Party to create a gerrymandered Congress that will do their obstructionist bidding; and by just how much money can be 'invested” in our political system in perfectly legal ways these days. And I haven't even mentioned the Other Candidate, who spent all of August on the true 'campaign trail,” hobnobbing not with ordinary Americans but with millionaires and billionaires (and assorted celebrities ) to build up her phenomenal ' war chest .”

Politicians Will Feel the Heat From Rising Temperatures Posted on Nov 4, 2016 
By Kieran Cooke / Climate News Network New research shows that the hotter it gets, the quicker the pace of political change. (Gabor Dvornik via Flickr) 
LONDON—Voters who feel good about life—whether it is to do with their job, their marriage or even the success of their sports team—are more likely to support their politicians. On the other hand, those who are disgruntled and fed up are more prone to want a change of political leadership. That, at least, is the received wisdom of political pundits. Rising temperatures New research indicates that, in future, climate change—and specifically rising temperatures—could also be a key factor in undermining and determining political longevity. The hotter it gets, the theory goes, the quicker the pace of political change. 
Nick Obradovich, a researcher at Harvard University in the US, has conducted what is described as the first ever investigation into the relationship between temperature, electoral returns and future climate change. 
In a study published in the journal Climatic Change , Obradovich sets out to substantiate the idea that climate change, by threatening feelings of wellbeing, will lead to a quicker turnover of politicians and political parties. There is no doubting the thoroughness of his research: altogether, Obradovich analysed more than 1.5 billion votes cast in nearly 5,000 elections in 19 countries ranging from Argentina to Zambia between 1925 and 2011. This data was then set alongside meteorological records. The analysis indicates, says Obradovich, that 'warmer than normal temperatures in the year prior to an election produce lower vote shares for parties already in power, driving quicker rates of political turnover”. ' Warmer than normal temperatures in the year prior to an election produce lower vote shares for parties already in power, quicker rates of political turnover” The study also finds that voter disgruntlement is more pronounced in warmer countries where average annual temperatures are above 21°C . 'In these warmer places, voter support shrinks by nine percentage points from one election to the next, relative to office bearers in cooler electoral districts,” the study finds. Countries lacking historical electoral data—including those in sub-Saharan Africa already feeling the impact of climate change—were not included in the research. Obradovich also uses climate models to predict future voter behaviour, suggesting that the pace of political change in many countries between now and the end of the century is likely to considerably speed up. 'Climate change may increase the frequency of democratic turnover most in warmer, poorer nations,” says the study. Fickle electorates Global warming is a complex problem that can only be tackled through international agreement and long-term planning. Obradovich says that faced with ever more fickle electorates, politicians in future will be tempted to focus on short-term policies instead of adopting longer-term strategies. This could not only hamper the fight against climate change but also cause economic and political upheaval. 'Turnover in nations with weak democratic institutions can up-end political stability—if incumbents in weak democracies foresee a greater risk of losing office, they sometimes employ electoral fraud and pre-electoral violence to maintain power,” says Obradovich. 'If these methods fail, incumbents' loss occasionally precipitates post-electoral violence that can in turn induce broader civil conflict.”

North Dakota's Public Bank Is Funding Police Repression at Standing Rock Posted on Nov 4, 2016 
By Matt Stannard / Cowboys on the Commons Matt Stannard 
The brutal repression of indigenous and allied protesters at Standing Rock has shocked the conscience of fair-minded Americans, particularly those advocating economic and ecological reform. Although the protesters had in some cases been encroaching on 'company land,” they had done so peacefully, and their chief modes of political action have been prayer and nonviolent civil disobedience. The crackdowns of the last few weeks have seen attack dogs and rubber bullets causing bloody injuries to protesters, detention and malicious prosecutions, and other dehumanizing behavior from the cops and soldiers deployed there by North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple. 
For those of us in the public banking movement, used to holding up the Bank of North Dakota (the nation's only public bank) as an example of how promising public banks are, the recent news that Dalrymple and an emergency spending panel voted to add $4 million in additional credit onto a $10 million line from BND, to fund law enforcement expenses at Standing Rock, is troubling. It means BND is using its heralded public power over fractional reserve banking to pay for those rubber bullets and a host of logistical expenses involved in arresting and evicting protesters the federal government has refused to evict, citing free speech concerns. 
This financing is part of one of BND's core functions: providing emergency loans. A more positive deployment of that function happened in 1997, when BND provided emergency loans for the Grand Forks flood, at a time when communities desperately needed loans before receiving slow-moving FEMA reimbursements. Unlike the need to abuse   the flood was a real public emergency–the flooding caused structure fires and destroyed dozens of buildings via fire or water. Property losses in Grand Forks topped $3.5 billion. There were 50,000 evacuees. BND provided over $70 million in funds for relief. 
The Bank of North Dakota was conceived a century ago in the molding of distinctly American, agrarian-socialist populism. North Dakota farmers were in trouble, getting cheated by the big banks and big grain companies headquartered in Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Those entities knew they had farmers at their mercy, and so all the interest rates were double-digit, all the loan terms were unfavorable (and less favorable to those who relied on them the most), and as the grain companies operated every grain elevator along the railroad route; those companies offered farmers destructively low prices, often cheating on tonnage because the farmers had nowhere else to go. 
  
In 1915, led by a struggling farmer named A.C. Townley, a group of North Dakotans formed the Nonpartisan League to push back against those powerful grain and banking interests. The NPL ended up taking political power in the state, creating both the Bank of North Dakota and the North Dakota Mill and Elevator. Today, those two public utilities are the only institutions of their kind under any state government in the U.S. They've long outlived the NPL, whose inexperienced political leaders were subject to constant attacks and red-baiting from big business interests, exacerbating NPL infighting and corruption, culminating in the recall of Governor Lynn Frazier, alongside whom the state legislature had created one of the most progressive state agendas in American history. 
Since then, for understandable reasons, BND has been militantly apolitical. BND President and CEO Eric Hardmeyer has explicitly repudiated arguments that the BND ought to be a model, despite his effective touting of its successes. The Bank exists to help the state and its businesses function well and to maintain liquidity and economic stability. BND created the infrastructure for North Dakota's oil boom, and if the state were to commit to a truly proactive transition to renewable and clean energy (it has taken baby steps), the BND would make it happen financially–with an efficiency that would put the rest of the country to shame. 
But in the present political reality, cops and soldiers are brutally cracking down on Standing Rock protesters, and BND is funding it, and that makes BND not truly apolitical, but a facilitator of injustice. Public banks are tools, not sources of virtue in themselves. In the hands of bad policymakers, they can prop up bad policies. 
So what do we do with this unfortunate knowledge, besides continuing to support the Standing Rock protesters, calling the governor regularly (if you do, please mention that using BND to finance repression is shameful), and pushing for a just and sustainable transition to clean energy (including economic support for energy sector workers and their families)? What do these unfortunate events teach us about our movement? 
First, the awful actions in North Dakota don't undermine the idea of public banking. If anything, they're more evidence against private ownership and shareholding in both fossil fuels and the financial sector. In financing those rubber bullets and smoke bombs, BND is paying the security costs of private corporations, subsidizing the worst of big oil capitalism. But as my colleague, Ira Dember, pointed out to me yesterday, North Dakota is rich in wind and is building wind farms. That four million dollars could have been better lent to develop additional wind resources and technology, and to train workers to transition from oil fields to wind farms and more. That depends on a larger movement, which I'll talk more about below. 
Second, the actions illustrate the folly of pushing for state and local control without accompanying universal human and environmental rights. Economic and environmental justice advocates have long promoted local autonomy as a bulwark against big corporations and their puppets in national and state government. But local governments (often pushed by state legislators and governors) can do violence to indigenous communities just as they have enforced segregation and lynchings in the South. Human rights and environmental protection must be encoded in national and international norms and these norms need to have a complimentary and non-oppressive relationship with local communities. That makes our coalition-building and policy-making tasks bigger and more challenging. It makes allies and communication more important, and demands clarity about various movements' and organizations' ethical frameworks. 
Third, you can't keep people you disagree with ideologically out of single-issue movements. Sometimes this can be frustrating: There are all sorts of people in the public banking movement, including a few supporters who aren't committed to ending fossil fuel consumption, and even weirder and more disturbing, a tiny handful of extremists who want to take down big private banks because they associate banking with Jews. Thankfully, those toxic forces don't show up in any significant numbers (and the Public Banking Institute has explicitly repudiated them). While the movement is primarily white and bourgeois, there are powerful non-white, non-bourgeois voices in it, and its alignment with the New Economy Coalition and other economic justice coalitions helps considerably. It matters who you do your activist business with. 
Finally, whatever your own organization's commitment to justice, the policies and institution your movement creates, if it is lucky enough to create them, will only be as socially positive and ethically correct as the people working inside of them, and the communities overseeing them. Public banks can fund a post-carbon, sustainable energy transition–but only if people successfully demand a post-carbon, sustainable energy transition. Public banks can create safe and prosperous communities for all, but only if that's what communities are already committed to. 
Public banking advocates, in particular, ought to emphasize the ways public control of state and municipal finance can fund new structures of work and production that neither exploit nor extract. That has always been the most powerful argument for public banks: that they can produce justice because as community-controlled entities, we can make them just.

Dakota Access Pipeline Protesters Maced, Hit with Rubber Bullets in Standoff Over Ancestral Land Posted on Nov 3, 2016 
By Emma Niles 
Tensions flared again Wednesday between North Dakota law enforcement and protesters of the Dakota Access pipeline. Filmmaker and activist Josh Fox was at the scene of the violent confrontation, where journalist Erin Schrode, among others, was shot with a rubber bullet at the front lines of the protest. 
'This is an insane situation,” Fox begins in a video streamed live to his Facebook page after the confrontation. 'We had a line of peaceful water protectors in the water, up to their waists, who were freezing cold. Those people were standing in front of a line of police, the police were occupying treaty land—not their land. Police were there with riot gear on, with shotguns, with rubber bullets, with mace, with pepper spray.” 
According to NBC , Wednesday's conflict took place at Cantapeta Creek, which runs just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation. Protesters grew agitated when police 'dismantled a wooden bridge that demonstrators constructed to access the sacred site.” The 'sacred site” refers to the hilltop across the creek where Standing Rock Sioux tribal ancestors are buried. 
The Young Turks network shared a brief video highlighting the escalating tensions: 
'This is land that is theirs, per the Laramie Treaty of 1851 ,” Schrode says in the video above. 'This is a militarized police force up against an unarmed, peaceful, prayerful people.” 
  
Women and children were reportedly present at the demonstrations. 
Another video, streamed live on Facebook by user Cempoalli Twenny, provides a clear shot of the bridge in question. Drumbeats and chants can be heard as several 'water protectors” attempt to cross the river: 

In a separate video , Twenny says that while being interviewed, police 'shot at the reporter” but were 'possibly aiming for me.” 
'[A] sista reporter was hit [instead],” he writes, referring to Schrode. 
On Facebook, Schrode shared video of the incident, which shows her interviewing Twenny when suddenly she is hit: 

'I was just shot,” says Schrode, a journalist who has worked with CNN, NBC and The New York Times, in a Wednesday post . 'Militarized police fired at me from point blank range with a rubber bullet on the front lines of Standing Rock.” 
She continues: 
My body will be okay, but I am hurting, I am incensed, I am weeping, I am scared. Peaceful, prayerful, unarmed, nonviolent people on one side of a river; militarized police with armed vehicles and assault weapons occupying treaty land on the other, where sacred burial grounds have already been destroyed. What is happening here in North Dakota is like nothing I have ever seen in my life, anywhere in the world. … 
It is inexcusable for the President Obama to say he will 'let it play out for several more weeks.” It is unjustifiable for the Attorney General to not be here. It is unconscionable for mainstream media to not cover this. It is indefensible for all politicians to not condemn what is occurring here. It is disgraceful for more people to not speak out and show up to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. 
Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney provided a very different perspective on the conflict. 'In my 27 years in law enforcement, I have never seen such an absolute disregard for the law, or other people's rights because of someone else's ideology,” he states in a press release. 'The idea that because you have a strong opinion about something means you can threaten, harass and intimidate other American citizens is just plain wrong.” 
Numerous video accounts show police officers firing rubber bullets at those standing in the water. The Morton County Sheriff's Department released a statement regarding its tactics. 
'Law enforcement witnessed protesters building an illegal, man-made, wooden bridge across the Cantapeta Creek,” the statement reads. 'Protesters involved in building the bridge violated numerous federal and state laws including the Clean Water Act and the Safe River and Harbors Act.” 
The statement continues: 
Authorities used less-than-lethal ammunition to control the situation. In one incident a male was at a boat and was throwing bottles at officers on the police line. A second incident occurred when a man wearing a gas mask, refused to show his hands, refused to disperse and charged the police line. Officers also deployed pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the group of protesters who came across the water and camp at officers. No lethal shots were fired from law enforcement. 
According to the press release, one person was arrested for 'conspiracy to commit obstruction of a government function” after purchasing kayaks and canoes for the demonstrators. In the past few months, hundreds of people have been arrested while fighting to halt the DAPL. 
'It was like witnessing Gandhi's Salt March,” Fox says, 'then suddenly I am watching people being maced, and I hear a pop and see that they shot Erin Schrode with a rubber bullet. How is it possible that from 10 feet away, they are shooting at   journalists, bystanders, medics?” TAGS:

Turkish Government Arrests Opposition Parliament Members in Further Descent Into Dictatorship Posted on Nov 4, 2016 
By Juan Cole / Informed Comment 
The Turkish government has detained 11 members of parliament from the leftist, feminist and pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), including the party's co-chairs. This step is intended to give Erdogan the majority in parliament he needs to make himself president for life, and to give Turkey (currently a parliamentary government) an imperial presidency on the Egyptian model. The pretext was that these MPs declined to testify in a witch-hunt inquiry. I.e., this is precisely McCarthyism. 
Since the failed July 15 coup, the Turkish government of President Tayyip Erdogan has fired 110,000 people–10,000 of them just last weekend– from the police, judiciary and other government offices. He has had 12,000 professors fired. Some 15 private universities have been summarily shut down on the grounds that they have some Gulen link. If all of them were involved in the coup, that action might be understandable. But manifestly, all were not. It is true that the rightwing religious Gulen cult has seeded covert agents throughout the Turkish government and business sector. But surely there are hundreds of them, not 110,000. Among the authoritarian steps he has taken is the lifting of parliamentary immunity, setting the stage or his current coup d'etat. 
Erdogan has also closed down 45 newspapers , 16 television channels and all told, 130 media organizations. Some were accused of having Gulen tendencies. Others are pro-Kurdish. Still others are secular. Many are just sometimes critical of Erdogan, which apparently is no longer going to be allowed. 
In modern democratic law, you can't fire or arrest someone for thought crimes. The arrestees need to have actually done something wrong. Erdogan is trying to criminalize entire groups, and suspiciously enough the only group left that is not taboo is followers of Erdogan–i.e. right of center, at least somewhat religious Sunni Muslim Turks, who make up about 40 percent of the population. Secularists are likely at least 25%, Kurds are 20% and Alevi Shiites are 20 percent (many Alevis are also secularists, and some religious Kurds vote for Erdogan, so you can't just add these groups up–they overlap). So Erdogan is engineering a dictatorship on behalf of a minority. 
Erdogan moreover isn't understanding when the rest of the world won't arrest people for thought crimes. He had demanded that PKK members and Gulenists be extradited from Germany, but the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel declined. Erdogan then went on a rant accusing Germany of giving material aid to terrorism. I mean, this behavior is unhinged. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Erdogan now has three big domestic political struggles going on: 1) against the old secular Kemalist movement, now a shadow of its former self with only a quarter of the seats in parliament; 2) against all the major Kurdish political groupings; and 3) against the rival 'Gulen” Muslim fundamentalist movement. 
Saturday's arrests targeted the moderate pro-Kurdish HDP, which has stood for feminism, gay rights, and a multi-cultural Turkey with a place for both Kurds and Turks (hence it is the Democratic Peoples' Party, with peoples in the plural). 
In June of 2015, the HDP won 13% of seats in parliament and left the ruling AKP or Justice and Development Party, Erdogan's party, with only about 40 percent. This development threw a spanner in the works as far as Erdogan's aspirations to become a powerful president for life went. He needed an absolute majority for his party in parliament. Whether he deliberately engineered a renewal of the war with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a group that in the past has been radical and separatist but that had said it was moderating, is a matter of dispute. What is clear is that the polarization resulting from new hostilities hurt the HDP. Erdogan's party refused to make a coalition with any of the other three major parties, causing snap elections. On Nov. 1, 2015, the AKP got a little over 50% of seats in parliament and the HDP shrank to only 10%. That outcome allowed Erdogan's AKP to form a government without a coalition partner, but did not allow it to amend the constitution by fiat. 
If the HDP members of parliament are permanently removed, perhaps even jailed, then Erdogan may argue that he has a majority of the remaining MPs and can move forward with his coronation as dictator in chief. 
Unfortunately for Turkey, Erdogan's erratic behavior is likely to tank the economy. The tourism sector has collapsed. Foreign Direct Investment depends on confidence, which is slipping away. 
Every new assault that Erdogan launches on democracy in Turkey has brought queries as to whether Turkish democracy is now definitively dead. The answer each time is yes. TAGS:

Robert Scheer and Lizbeth Mateo Explore the Contradictions of U.S. Immigration Policy Posted on Nov 4, 2016 Lawyer and immigrant rights activist Lizbeth Mateo. (KCRW) 
In this week's episode of 'Scheer Intelligence,” the Truthdig editor in chief speaks with the lawyer and immigrant rights activist who self-deported in order to illuminate the plight of immigrants. 
Mateo came to the United States with her family at age 14 and attended college and law school. She returned to Mexico for several days in 2013 and was subsequently denied DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), calling into question her ability to live and work in the United States. 
In their conversation, Mateo tells Scheer why she decided to become an activist and self-deport, knowing it was a risky move. She discusses why President Obama has been called by some 'The Deporter-in-Chief,” and tells Scheer that whatever happens in the presidential election, immigrants will not forget the politicians who remained silent while Donald Trump insulted them. 
A rushed transcript follows. 
—Posted by Alexander Reed Kelly 
Robert Scheer: Hi. This is Robert Scheer. Welcome to another addition of Scheer Intelligence where the intelligence comes from my guests and in this case it is LIzbeth Mateo, a immigrant activist, who has had a rich history ever since she came into this country, dealing with immigration laws. She came in at the age of fourteen from Oaxaca, she went to local schools, graduated from Venice High School and actually, spent two years at Santa Monica College, where we are broadcasting from. Very proud alumni. Went on, then to Cal State-Northridge and another great local institution and then went up to Santa Clara College, a Jesuit institution in Silicon Valley and graduated from law school. 
All of which would now put her in position for a great career except there is a question about her documentation, which is actually the subject of this podcast. Everybody is now talking about immigration reform or getting rid of immigrants or what have you and there is a lot of hypocrisy around this issue but one of the bright spots, although maybe Elizabeth will disagree with me, is that at least here in the state of California, which has been ahead of the country, I think, on immigration reform as far as licenses. In one bill, Jerry Brown, our Governor, signed, you can actually get credentialed as a lawyer and function. 
Why don't we begin with that? On the one hand, you represent the great achievement of the American melting pot. A person who did everything right and yet you could have been eligible for the Dream Act that Obama has proclaimed or seems to support. There is a bit of a mixed record there from Obama on this, which you can discuss, but you have a problem in your record in that you were an activist and one of your activist actions was to self-deport, so why don't we talk about that. 
Lizbeth Mateo: Yes, first of all, thank you so much for inviting me, for having me here. I am essentially what a lot of people call a dreamer. I came to the US at a very young age. I went to high school, college in the area, I graduated from law school and yes, California has been, I think, at the forefront of immigrant rights issues for a long time. We are able to get in-state tuition, pay like everyone else who is a citizen. Also get certain financial aid and more recently, at least for me, the most crucial thing in my career is that I can actually get a license. I can take the Bar, get a license, and practice law. 
The issue is, now, I can't work legally in the US. I don't have a work permit because I do qualify, in my opinion, for deferred action for childhood arrivals or DACA as most people know it, which is a program that President Obama created in 2012. 
However, as part of my activism, I left the country in 2013, briefly, with two other young people and we joined a campaign called the Bring Them Home Campaign. We essentially met with other young people in Mexico who had been deported, who had left for family reasons, for other emergencies, who wanted to come home. We came back , the nine of us, we were named the Dream Nine and we presented ourselves at the border and asked the government to allow us to come home, which they did after seventeen days in detention and so, I went on to law school, thinking I am going to remain in this country, I have been allowed to come home and I am going to apply for DACA eventually, which I did, only to receive not one but two notices of intent to deny from the government citing that exit. That is what I am dealing with right now and that is what I am fighting for. 
Scheer: So this is a situation that a lot of people fall into. That something has gone array in their papers either because they were really great citizens, like you, activists to try to make the country better or they had some technical difficulty. 
Speaking as a lawyer, what can be done now, not just in your case, where do we stand on the immigration issue? I know the Democrats are saying they are great on it and they are getting a lot of votes based on that. They weren't always great and the Republicans are being led by an out and out neo-fascist, Donald Trump, who wants to just blame, when he is not blaming Muslims, he wants to blame immigrants, undocumented immigrants, for all of our problems. Of course, they have nothing to do with it. We are in a weird place where the good people haven't always been so good. 
Mateo: Yes, and that is a problem. Especially during this election that has been very negative, where immigrants have been described with some of the most horrible words but I think, at least for me, not so much from the stand point of a law graduate or a future lawyer, but more from the stand point of an immigrant and an organizer, I think that we need to be ready regardless of who becomes President. Even if it is Hilary Clinton. She is saying some great things about immigrants now but she hasn't always been on our side. She was the first one to call for the deportation of minors, refugee children from Central America. She has agreed with the policies of President Obama to deport almost three million people at this point, 2.5 million people, including many of those refugee children, many of who are still in jails across the country at this point. 
To me, that is just unacceptable that in this country we put kids in jails, in prisons. I think whoever becomes President, we have to be ready to keep organizing like we have so far and that is part of the reason why I am speaking out on my case and why the government wants to deny me a benefit that, one, I qualify for and two, that I think I have worked very hard for and have, in many ways, earned through my activism, through my work in my personal life and that is the kind of message that I am trying to send to the community at this point. 
Scheer: You know, living here in Los Angeles and running into a lot of people, students of my own at USC and elsewhere who have questionable status, they are a little angry with Obama and some of them, my students, have called him the Deporter in Chief. 
Mateo: He is the President who has deported more undocumented immigrants in the history of this country and that is ... 
Scheer: More than any other President.

Informed Rant': The Violence of Borders, Racist Mascots and The Real News Posted on Nov 4, 2016 Detail from the cover of Reece Jones' book, 'Violent Borders.” (Verso Books) 
In this week's episode of 'Informed Rant,” the podcast of Joshua Scheer, Scheer speaks with Reece Jones, associate professor of Geography at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, about Jones' book, 'V iolent Borders: Refugees and the Right to Move ” and the human cost of borders. 
Scheer also speaks with Paul Jay, co-founder and editor in chief of The Real News, about the site's significance, and Robert Holden, deputy director of the National Congress of American Indians, about racism and sports mascots after the world series. 
A rushed transcript follows. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Joshua Scheer: My guest right now is Professor Reece Jones, he's a geopolitical expert. He teaches geography at the University of Hawaii Manila. His book is 'Violent Borders”. We're discussing refugees. Thank you for joining me. 
Reece Jones: Thanks for having me on. 
Scheer: You ask this question in the book, and obviously every day there's some big story about migrants and refugees and what's happening in the world. We just saw it yesterday with the so-called jungle being torn down in France. This morning I woke up to the BBC saying 238 migrants may have drowned outside of Libya. You study this, talking about limiting the movements of the poor and you ask this question in the beginning of your book. Talk about this. The limiting of the movements of these refugees and what you've seen, both in your field research, but also in the media reports and everything else that we're all seeing right now. We've seen over the last, certainly the last few years, but this is not a new movement as you write about in your book. 
Jones: I've been studying borders for about 15 years now, and over that period of time, I've seen two big changes happening at borders. The first is the construction of a lot of border infrastructure that is designed to limit the movement of people across border spaces and to deter people from trying to make trips across borders. This infrastructure is both the deployment of a lot more border agents at borders, the use of new surveillance technologies and military technologies in border spaces, but it's probably most evident if you look at walls. 
Walls are a good way to symbolize the hardening of borders that's happened in the past 15 years. In 1990 there were about 15 border walls around the world, so relatively few. Today there are almost 70 walls on borders around the world, so there's been a dramatic increase in the number of walls. Those walls symbolize all of the other infrastructure that goes along with that. The militarization of the security in these spaces. 
The second trend that I've noticed that goes along with that is a dramatic increase in the number of people dying at borders. If you look at the edges of the European Union, in the 1990s there were less than a hundred deaths per year at the edges of the EU, whereas in the past decade, those numbers have gone up dramatically. We're talking about in the last 3 years in a row, over 3,500 people have died at the edges of the EU every single year. 
That's part of a global trend. From 2005 to 2014, 40,000 people globally died trying to cross the border. In the last 2 years, as you mentioned during your introduction, that's increased even more. Over 10,000 people have died trying to cross a border in just 2015 and 2016. 
Scheer: Yes, and you have the number in ... A lot of numbers in your book, and it's very interesting walls. Can you explain, we're going to get into the violence aspect, but explain this concept that was foreign to me, humanitarian fencing which you saw in Spain and elsewhere. What is humanitarian fencing? How does that relate? 
Jones: In some border areas, there's an effort to construct fencing that is meant to deter people from crossing rather than injure them in the crossing process. If you look at the US fence, the one that was built after the Secure Fence Act passed in 2006, it doesn't have a lot of barbed wire on it, instead it's a wall, it prevents movement, but it doesn't have the ways to injure people crossing. The EU fencing in Spain for example, is also similar in that respect. It doesn't have all the barbed wire that we see in other borders around the world. 
That doesn't mean that it doesn't have a dangerous effect on people's lives, because what we see over and over again is that as particular border crossing routes are closed, fences are always built in the easier places for people to cross between cities, it diverts people to ever more dangerous routes. That's why there's been this dramatic increase in deaths, because as borders become harder to cross, we've seen that it doesn't deter people from crossing as it was predicted to do. Instead, it forces them to cross in these very dangerous places, which means the deserts of the US Southwest. 
In Arizona for example, where the number of deaths increased dramatically as fences were built on the US border. At the edges of the EU it means the people are crossing in the Mediterranean. They're having to go to Libya, and having to use smugglers and are put in these very dangerous situations, which results in these really high death rates of people trying to cross into Europe. 
Scheer: My guest is Reece Jones, he's a geography professor at the University of Hawaii Manila, and his book is Violent Borders, Refugees and the Right to Move. This is not a new concept as you write about though. The Great Wall of China you write about, Hadrian's wall, it created a defensive control. Good taxes, and let's get into that a little bit. The walls that were created, like for the Great Wall of China, and then with feudal lords and common lands using hedges and other mechanisms. 
We start to shift the conversation into the state's responsibility, because as you write in your book, this is not ... One, as you write or as other geographers have also written, to be modern is to be ... Modern citizen it to be a mobile citizen, and also we have been always in migration. Our history's in migration. Let's talk about the history of basically creating walls and then where we have reached today in which states are protecting us and we have this national identity based on borders. 
Jones: What I argue in the book, the broader argument that I make in the book is that the walls that we see today and all of the security infrastructure that goes along with them at borders, the idea of citizenship, the use of passports, the imposition of border patrols, is new in the way that it's happening at borders, but I argue that it's part of a much longer term history that's part of this contest between people moving around and states' efforts to try to control that movement. 
I argue that a powerful historical process is the state using movement restrictions to contain the poor to particular places to lower their wages to to make them have no wages. What we see today is part of that longer history. In the past it was things like slavery, or serfdom, or vagrancy laws or poor laws, that kept the poor locked into particular places and allowed the wealthy to access their wages to they work at low wages or no wages. Today we see that with borders. 
The poor are restricted to the countries of their birth and this creates pools of low-wage labor that lets corporations move factories to locations where it's advantageous to them, but doesn't allow workers to move to places where they could demand higher wages. What I argue in the book is that the violence we see at borders today is part of that effort to contain the poor to particular places to protect the privileges and wealth that have accrued in other places.

Cast Your Vote: What Was Most Significant in Shaping the 2016 Election? Posted on Nov 4, 2016 Are you voting on November 8? ( Flickr / CC 2.0 ) 
In four days, the unprecedented political chaos that is the 2016 presidential election will ( hopefully ) come to a close. Looking back on the past year, we see innumerable instances of political turmoil that may shape Tuesday's outcome. 
Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has faced his share of obstacles. Most notably, a leaked tape from Access Hollywood almost derailed his campaign in October. Hillary Clinton's campaign, meanwhile, has been marred by the FBI's investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state—a topic that has yet again become a focus of national attention because of FBI Director James Comey's timing . 
Outside the two main-party candidates' own woes, other crucial issues have absorbed the nation throughout the election season: The battle over the Dakota Access pipeline . The changing role of third-party candidates . A renewed focus on racial inequality . And of course, the trove of information given to us by WikiLeaks. 
As we look toward Tuesday, the finale of an increasingly tight race to the White House, we at Truthdig turn to our readers to ask: What was the most significant story of the 2016 election season? Note that our poll is not intended as a scientific evaluation, but rather as a chance for readers to express their opinions and expand upon their answers in the comment section of this post. 
Let us know in the poll below. Vote early but not often: One vote per person, please. Several possible answers are offered, but you can also choose 'Other” and type in your own—we want to know what we've missed! 
(Make your selection and then click on 'Vote.” To see how others have weighed in, click on 'Results.”) Which event was most significant in shaping the 2016 election? The allegations of sexual assault against Donald Trump following his leaked 'lewd remarks” The FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server The battle over the Dakota Access pipeline The presence of third-party candidates like Jill Stein and Gary Johnson A renewed focus on America's racial inequality The 'Podesta Emails” released by WikiLeaks Other
