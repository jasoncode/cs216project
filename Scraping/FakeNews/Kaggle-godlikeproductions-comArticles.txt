Why the Jobs Aren't Coming Back. The 'modern day marvel.' The machines are taking over The candidates in the current campaign '“ or any campaign '“ are all promising to 'bring back good jobs' to 'create good jobs.' When asked how they would do that, they are all a little light on details.About a year ago, Joe Biden was in Michigan to celebrate the opening of a new manufacturing plant that made 'small metal clamps' used in all kinds of industries to hold wiring, hoses. Etc. in place. The largest market is the auto industry but they are sold to hundreds of other manufacturers. Depending on size, shape, and material, these parts sell for a few pennies or less. You have to make a lot of these parts to have any substantial billing numbers.This new plant is fully automated and runs 24/7/365 with just 14 people. Joe was quite happy saying 'manufacturing is returning to America.'However, there is a backstory. That plant had been around for years. It had employed 600 people on two shifts. Then, the Chinese began to undercut the pricing, and the plant was no longer profitable and closed. Two years later, it reopened as a fully automated plant and regained the business because it could now manufacture cheaper than the Chinese.There are several stories inside the main story.The first story is about the initial plant closing. Anytime 600 people lose their jobs, you know that some employee ended up losing their home, that some cars were reprocessed, that some college kid had to quit school, etc. Retailers got hit. Utilities at the plant were no longer needed. Suppliers got hit too.More at [ My mom said the only reason men are alive is for lawn care and vehicle maintenance." 09

 GOP Cites Success in Limiting Voter Fraud One of the best ways to limit voter fraud is to reduce the number of people able to vote, since, if the amount of voter fraud is constant percentage-wise, when there are less people voting, the voter fraud will automatically be reduced. It is particularly important to do this in areas with high numbers of democrats, since that is where such noted poll watchers and intellectuals as Alex Jones and Trump ally Roger Stone say the voter fraud actually occurs:

I'm so tired of all these psychotics babbling anti Trump Propaganda Fucking libtards are completely brainless.I don't like Trump. Never have. Never watched The Apprentice. Turned the channel every time he came on TV. He was like the Khardashians to me. Crass commercialism by a person who was neither talented nor interesting. But. I am sick of all this insane Bullshit. 1. He is not a racist. He has been a public figure for 50 freaking years and nobody ever said that until he runs for President. And we know that they call every Republican racist. So why the fuck are you repeating, it you brainless fucktard? Don't you know propaganda when you hear it?- building a wall and saying SOME Mexicans are criminals IS NOT RACIST. Some Mexicans are criminals. Just look at the Federal Prison stats, idiot.- saying we must ban Muslims UNTIL WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND WHY THEY ARE HERE is not racist. There are assholes walking into malls in Minneapolis now screaming 'Allah Ahkbar' as they stab my fellow Americans. They BLEW UP THE FUCKING BOSTON MARATHON. So take that 'Islamaphobia' propaganda and shove it up your fucking ass. - saying 'the mexican judge' who keeps ruling against me in a lawsuit is biased is not racist. The Fucker is part of LaRaza. The law firm that brought the suit is sending other La Raza lawyers into the court to try the case. That is a conflict of interest. And I don't care if the guy was born in fucking Illinois. There are all kind of guys I know, he was born in NY. He is still 'Irish' to me because his family was. Or 'Italian'. Or 'A Jew'. It's just a shorthand, especially used a lot by New Yorkers because everyone is something. 2. The sexual harassment crap is bullshit. The guy has been running for President for over a year. Not a tweet. Not a chirp. Then he whacks that fucking fat-ass midget with the mean streak and the history of documented lying who covered for her whore hopping scumbag husband for 30 years with it all, and suddenly Gloria Allred, A CLINTON DELEGATE TO THE DNC CONVENTION, starts popping up people from left field to make spurious claims out of the ass while CNN, run by MAJOR CLINTON SUPPORTER Zucker, shills for the whole thing. What are you fucking stupid eating that bullshit? You look like an idiot.3. Nuclear Codes. What a bunch of shit. First, Hillary is an old ill woman who has seizures, can't stand up, can't hear, and when she testifies before Congress claims she can't remember anything that happened. So....you are worried about Trump with the Nuclear Codes?Oh, yah, and she was Sect. of State exactly while the US policy in the Middle East went to shit, created ISIS and directly caused the greatest Human disaster since World War II which is now threatening to spread terrrorists all over Europe and the US. AND SHE IS COMPLETELY CLUELESS ABOUT IT. She will tell you that we need to be kind and nice to the religion of peace OR it will Cause Terrorism. Oh Ya? Well Obama did it your way...AND NOW PEOPLE ARE WALKING INTO MALLS IN MINNESOTA SCREAMING 'ALLAH AHKBAR' AS THEY STAB MY FELLOW AMERICANS.So, beside that what do we have? Your propaganda masters used to claim that the Republicans were all anti-gay christian bigots. Well, OBVIOUSLY NOT TRUMP. He is from New York. He bangs models. He used to hangout at Studio 54 in the coke and gay days. He knew Andy Warhol. Guy is middle of the road. Guy went to the Wharton School and has testified before Congress about Money Supply, Credit and Economics. Guy will fill his cabinet with the best people and run things like a CEO. Guy seems to care about Veteran Issues, Social Security and the safety net, healthcare. All the things you fugging libtards are usually all inflamed about. You are like Pavlov's dogs, sitting up on your hinds and barking on commands because your liberal propaganda masters tell you to. You are pathetic. You suck. You are a monumental asshole.

 Americans, never let them put voting machines for you, the election will be rigged Since 2000, the elections here has voting machines from SmartMatics, and since then, the socialists and leftists always win the presidential election. Sounds like it's just part of the globalist agenda, and the last election was rigged as fuck. The socialist Dilma won again, but her ass was kicked this year, she was impeached after put the nation into a severe economical and political crisis, almost causing a civil war, dividing the country.

 nuclear weapons question Hello all.. I have been a longtime lurker on this board but this is my first time posting. I have many questions that I'm hoping someone can help me with since you all seem to be very knowledgeable in this area..In terms of nuclear weapons I know we have tested over 1000 and I know the radiation has increased cases of cancer and killed livestock but shouldn't there be more of an impact? I know the theory with nuclear war ending life as we know it derives from the fact that it would cause a nuclear winter there for beginning some sort of ice age on earth.. with all the weapons that have been tested should we not have already brought ourselves to this or does it more have to do with all weapons going off all at once? Another question being I heard that radiation dissipates quickly (with the most dangerous time being the first 48 hours) if so then how would it cause a nuclear winter? I know these are silly questions I am pretty bad with science so I am hoping someone can explain better.Another question.. I am very sure this article has been linked here before but wondering if someone can give me their thoughts and either disprove the article or explain why it's true. [ link to heiwaco.tripod.com ] Personally I find it's safer to believe they work, if a crazy person threatens you saying they have a gun you take it for face value. You don't want to question them about it or dare them to prove it!In terms of world 3... have all biblical prophecies been fulfilled already to believe world war 3 is next on the timeline? I would be lying if I said I'm not scared. When it comes to death. .it sucks sure but I'm not afraid for myself.. I'm afraid for my one year old! I will do ANYTHING to protect her even if it means giving up my life so she can have a beautiful, healthy, long life! I do believe in God and I find myself turning a lot to him these last few days but I can't help but be angry and feel so guilty bringing this beautiful soul into this world.. for what? So she can suffer and die before she even turns 3? I just feel so lost and hurt. If anyone can give me advice or guidance I would appreciate it more than you know. The aspect of the end being at our door isn't too much a problem for me.. it's more the aspect that I don't want this for my child! I want her to live her life! Fall in love! See the world!I don't know.. maybe the time isn't here.. we've been close to a nuclear war once before maybe just maybe we can dodge this again. Page 1

Joint anti-Hungary media operation. Nice to see the attackers getting embarassed Ooh la la a joint anti-Hungary media operation has just started....October 23rd was the 60th commemoration of the 1956 Hungarian anti-communist revolution, so both Time and The Guardian used the opportunity to release articles comparing the 1956 Hungarian refugees with today's forced migration. They are basically saying: "shame on you, Hungary, back then the whole world welcomed Hungarians as refugees and now you are not welcoming refugees"Comments have been already disabled, but they're a telling read it just shows the stupidity of the editorComparing Hungarian war refugees who were being murdered by Soviets and who fled to a neighbour country , Austria, patiently waiting to be "transfered" wherever they would be accepted with this hoard of migrants who think they can go wherever they want by violating several countries' borders, raping children, raping women aso. is more than disgusting.Hungary is not a neighbour state to Syria, inor Afghanistan, nor Pakistan. These people are NOT refugees, they stopped being refugees as soon as they left the first safe country they got to!This disgusting and highly offensive article should be deleted on the spot!

I look forward to the bubble bursting again in the Bay Area. Those little high tech weenies bug me. And I'm a techie!!! The rumored second round of layoffs at Twitter '“ which in 2011 was granted by the befuddled city of San Francisco the 'Twitter tax break' on employment taxes '“ comes at a very inopportune moment for the glory of commercial real estate. These layoffs would amount to 8% to Twitter's workforce, or about 300 people, according to Bloomberg.Already, Twitter has thrown 183,642 square feet of vacant office space at its two-building Mid-Market headquarters on the sublease market, thus bringing it to 1.51 million square feet (msf).This comes at a time when, according to the 'snapshot' from Cushman & Wakefield, leasing activity nearly ground to a halt in the third quarter, with only 875,000 sf leased '“ the lowest since 2001!There was only one major lease deal over 100,000 sf: Amazon's live streaming video platform Twitch, which took 178,000 sf. The next largest deal was less than half that size: WeWork leased 78,000 sf.Leasing activity for the three quarters this year plunged 30% from the same period last year, to just 4.7 msf, according to a report released this week by commercial real estate services firm Savills Studley, which added dryly, 'The competition for space has calmed dramatically from several quarters ago.'And there is a lot of new supply coming on the market, according to Cushman & Wakefield: currently, 3.8 msf of office space are under construction, with 31% preleased.Overall vacancy rose 0.7 percentage points from the prior quarter to 9.0% in Q3, according to Savills Studley. In Class A buildings, availability jumped 1.1 percentage points to 10.4%. Some areas were still red-hot, but others are turning cold: In the SOMA area, there were practically no vacancies (1.0%). But at the other end of the spectrum, vacancies at the Financial District South spiked 2.5 percentage points to 12.3%.way more at [ link to wolfstreet.com ] "My mom said the only reason men are alive is for lawn care and vehicle maintenance." 1 Previous Page

comments circulating about the Republican presidential candidate Interesting: Not what I thought it was going to be. This is an eye-opener my friends. Please Read all the way to the bottom and pass it on! "He's been divorced and remarried. He can't commit to anything.""He's dangerously ignorant about international affairs. The Russianleaders will walk all over him.""He has no filter- doesn't think before he speaks.""Until recently, he was a Democrat. He's not a real Republican. Hehasn't paid his GOP dues.""He used to be Pro Choice. Now, suddenly he's Pro Life?""That can't be his real hair!""He's a loose cannon. No one wants HIS finger on the nuclearbutton.""His opponent has the experience and political savvy to bepresident. He does not.""His temperament disqualifies him from ever beingCommander-In-Chief.""He's proven himself to be mentally unstable.""The military will never accept him as Commander-In-Chief. He's notsmart enough.""The GOP doesn't want him to be the head of the party. He could never reach across the aisle to get anything done.""Most Republican voters will just stay home rather than go out andvote for him.""Evangelicals will never support him.""He says '(Lets) Make America Great Again'. How dare he say wearen't still great?""His intellect is thinner than spit on a slate rock."After all his gaffs, he doubles down on them instead of admittinghe made a mistake.""He's threatening to upend our treaties and relationships with ourallies by demanding that they pay for their own defense!""Because of his gross factual errors he might take rash action andneedlessly lead this country into open warfare!""He's racist, xenophobic, and fuels the fires of hatred!""The rising turnout of his voters are not loyal Republicans orDemocrats and are alienated from both parties because neither takes asympathetic view toward their issues. "The fact that he could be deemed a serious candidate for presidentis a shame and embarrassment for the country."Is he Safe? ...he shoots from the hip ... he's over his head ...What are his solutions?"Voters want to follow some authority figure, a leader who can takecharge with authority; return a sense of discipline to our government; and,manifest the willpower needed to get this country back on track -- Or atleast a leader from outside Washington."

HOT: "Norpoth's Model" Predicts Trump Presidency Trump Is Going To Be The Next President, According To This ModelBY: Eugene Daniels12:34 PM, Oct 26, 2016 LINK: [ link to www.theindychannel.com ] ARTICLE TEXT:Forget the polls. Donald Trump is going to be the next president &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#655'‹33;&#65533; at least according to one pretty accurate election model.This assertion isn't a surprise. In February, the model's creator, Helmut Norpoth, gave Trump a 97 percent chance of becoming No. 45 if he got the GOP nomination, though the model now gives Trump an 87 percent chance.Norpoth's model predicts general election results based on how the candidate does in his or her party's primary. Norpoth applied the model to past elections and says it worked for every presidential election except one since 1912."My feeling always has been, what I saw in the primaries, was that Donald Trump did very well," Norpoth said. "He beat a large field. According to my metric about how primaries are shaping up, he did better than Hillary Clinton in the Democratic race, so that gave him a leg up."There are a couple of issues with this. Usually, candidates shift their message after the primary to appeal to voters outside their base. Trump isn't doing that. His speeches haven't changed much, if at all, and he's not really bringing anyone new into his tent.Also, the model doesn't factor in anything that's actually happening in the country at the time. And factors like the economy, the incumbent president's approval numbers and the country's demographics all affect how people cast their vote in November.Outside of Norpoth's model, basically every other measurement out there shows Donald Trump's chance of winning 270 electoral votes is super slim. But, hey, this is 2016, and if we've learned anything, it's that there is nothing normal about this election cycle. Page 1

But when the left get in office the doomsaying increases. Now i am sure the effect is opposite. If trump gets in office i am sure the doomsaying will increase on the left side of the political spectrum. Page 1

 Unthinkable If it ever were discovered that the voting was total bullshit (and I'm not suggesting that) and that they decided in 2008 that Hillary was next, then chaos would ensue. It's just a passing thought but there has been so much fraud discovered so far by Hillary, like the debate questions given in advance and the meetings with reporters which influenced the Electoral College before the election. So you know what I think? I say we send in the military to grab all the voting machines and do the election entirely on paper. Even if it takes two weeks to count the votes. Just saying. Page 1

 If the Christian evangelicals believe Trump will save America then that means he will destroy it instead. These people are always wrong. They supported bush. The patriot act. Torture. The war in Iraq. They demonized anybody who didn't support the war. Called them unpatriotic. These also are the same people who want to bomb Iran because it would bring about the rapture. They told us Obama was the antichrist and would take away your guns but then nothing happened. And they think Putin(Mr. KGB)is a great man.

His favourite performer, Iris Chacon, crooned a birthday tune set to mariachi music."I feel happy," said the wheelchair-bound Mercado, who has difficulty hearing and has been blind for four years. He lives with a niece in the northwestern coastal town of Isabela.Mercado was recruited into the U.S. army in 1918, during the last months of the First World War. He was still in training when the war ended in November of that year.As a young man, Mercado said he worked for 50 cents US a day driving animals loaded with sugar cane to processing centres.The mayor of Isabela, Charlie Delgado, said a residence for the elderly would be named for Mercado in honour of a man who "ate healthy, had no major vices and who has put this island on the world stage."Guinness had recognized another Puerto Rican as being the world's oldest person.

 Planet nine might be pulling our solar system out of alignment Astronomers have speculated for years that there could be a large planet in the outer reaches of our solar system, but no such object has ever been directly observed. However, the harder we look, the more plausible the existence of 'planet nine' becomes. Astronomers Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown of Caltech have added another piece of evidence to the debate. Their observations indicate that planet nine could be causing a 'wobble' in the solar system.

 The media chooses our president (Hillary), because we're a nation of morons. If the media said, "Trump's a genius, women like him, he's a man's man, he's dynamic, he's vibrant... but Hillary is crooked and she's a criminal and no one likes her" Blah Blah... if that happened, women would support and vote for Trump, etc.Think about that. Just flip the whole thing.There's never been a pile-on in MSM history like the one against Trump.While he had a few unforced errors, I don't think it would matter much what he did. They would trash him, or drag up 10 year old Tweets and play them 24/7 all day, even if he had pivoted to being presidential.If they wanted to prop up Trump and destroy Hillary, we would have seen the opposite happen.This entire election has been nothing more than an exercise in mass propaganda. Hillary is the chosen candidate of the Establishment, and she shall win. Early voting totals already show the Democrats are showing up in big numbers for Hillary, and Republicans are lagging behind.The election IS rigged, but largely by the media and voting scams may not be necessary if the Sheeple are compliant .

I do care. 11:20 PM; as opposed to what? you only know me starting from a period where I experienced many of the worst things in my life, to be honest you don't have a strong baseline in knowing me yet, and it takes years for most 11:22 PM: just an intuition 11:22 PM; there's a difference between life is hard now and life is hard 11:23 PM; if you want to know what I meant, not expecting that she did. I see the same potential and value in all forms of life. I don't see humanity as any better or worse than any other species and if I were to attribute "genius" to anything it would be to the spirit that binds with the human body. I don't think she took it that way but her response was emotive as it was, no point in adding to it. She feels how she feels, I do how I do. An argument changes neither of our views and how we act in real life. Hence adding about practicality and empirical occurrence. If things don't change in real life, I don't see the point in arguing. 11:32 PM; out and about 11:34 PM: there is a value in exchanging ideas even if you don't mutually change your original opinion, it offers perspective 11:34 PM; I've been over that same notion with others before, I lean away from that 12:16 AM: why? 12:16 AM; start with why not? 12:17 AM: didn't I just say my opinion though? that would be my reason 12:17 AM; for me, cost benefit analysis is usually such that discussions carry more risk than potential benefit 12:18 AM: see, I don't feel that way at all. I feel exactly the opposite. I always feel that if you are open to learning about others, there's never a wasted discussion 12:19 AM; one can't give equal weight to all relationships, one can't be open to everyone yet give whole focus on who counts most in their life 12:21 AM: well, yeah you prioritize the people who count the most to you, but that doesn't have to exclude others you talk to either 12:21 AM; I mean things quite more broadly, taken in principle and in turn down to the minute. If I spent so much time engaging in random discussions with random people I'd hardly have the time and energy for discussions and people that are not so random to my life, let alone those not random at all. 12:23 AM: I disagree. I think there is plenty of time for discussions with random strangers and important people. We spend a lot of time online anyway, we might as well make the time we do spend meaningful. Plenty just browse social media or don't interact at all. We may be strangers but we are a real social circle. It may be far less important then the face to face interactions for you, but is there no time for it and is it meaningless? IMO no. 12:28 AM; You misunderstand. Before I speak for myself more, take a look at the fueds of the people you know. You can't choose equanimity for all of them even if you wanted to. 12:31 AM: sure, but that doesn't mean those people don't mean anything to me, or that I'd write them off 12:32 AM; It's not about that, especially if you're focusing on discussion/interaction in this case. If anything to opt out represents greater sense of caring for others. 12:33 AM: how? 12:33 AM; by sparing people hardship through disagreement for one 12:34 AM: disagreement is enlightening. as sun tzu says, those we disagree with often teach as the most. I think it's important to understand the perspective of others. it's not a hardship, discussion and disagreement is how the truth is found. if you avoid those who disagree with you you easily fall prey to a cognitive fallacy known as confirmation bias 12:35 AM; note I said cost benefit analysis before. the risks comes too great and people get heated and even friendships break. I say that from observation including of your own friends, and I say that from experience regarding mine. I spared ___ an argument just now that wouldn't have changed her view on anything if it happened, nor would it have changed mine. It's the same now, I won't change your view and you won't change mine. 12:37 AM: well that's silly imo ___. I think intellectual peers need to learn how to dissociate their ideas from their feelings and friendships and the people in this room are more then capable of that. are you? 12:38 AM Page 1

Question about the constitutional amendment that Trump proposed. Did anyone listen to his speech in Gettysburg, PA?He said, as a contract, and I quote, "a constitutional amendment to OPPOSE term limits on all members of congress."I think he meant IMPOSE, but he is a business man that works with wording of contracts.I tried to find more information on his website, but there is no reference to it.I like Trump, it was a tough choice between Giant Meteor and Trump, but in the end, I voted early for Trump (AZ).What he is asking to do is change the constitution, which we should never take lightly.In this video on this website at ruffly the 16 min 40 sec mark, is says "constitutional amendment to OPPOSE term limits on all members of congress"I even turned on the CC function and it took it as OPPOSE too.The media is reporting it as IMPOSE, but that's not what he said.I was wondering if anyone has direct reference from Trump's camp.THX

IPet Goat And The Solar Flare In the video IPet Goat II, you see many symbols, some appear to represent celestial movements. In Egyptian mythology the planets and stars are shown in hieroglyphs as moving about on boats. In the film IPet Goat II, there is a figure riding on a boat which has been called Messianic by some viewers. However, I think this figure is a representation of the sun, he is very yellow, like the Simp(suns), he appears to be covered in flames and his hair looks distinctly like flames. He also seems to have sunspots on his face. Sunspots are quite distinct from ordinary spots.The reason I mention the Simp(suns) is that their eyes are designed to look like the circumpunct, a circle with a dot in the centre which represents the sun. [ link to en.wikipedia.org (secure) ] Also in the simpsons, Homer is obsessed with doughnuts and the torus is a doughnut shape that is seen throughout nature and space and has been the subject of much theorising by physicists such as Nassim Harramein.Sorry, back to IPet Goat II. The II in the title suggests it could be the symbol of Gemini. In the celestial realm the sun is currently moving through the sign of Gemini and will be moving to Wasat, a fixed star in the constellation and which appears to be where you might locate the phallus part of the constellation.You can see the phallus around the 4 min mark [ link to en.wikipedia.org (secure) ] This area is where the water signs are located in the sky. The sun moved through this area over the past few months.A little further in the video, just after the phallus scene, you see the sun produce either a massive solar flare or possibly an EMP which knocks out the grey men in the suits.Now I know there is much speculation about a possible celestial event and/or a financial collapse happening soon, perhaps these events have been foreshadowed by this video.The sun reaches the phallus around 11th July and if the video is prophetic, then we can expect some solar related event to happen very soon after that.This is the sun's position on 11th July Re: IPet Goat And The Solar Flare "The more you know, the crazier you look"  Re: IPet Goat And The Solar Flare Maybe the Christ figure is a representation of you and your journey through this reality.

God Has Hidden This For 2,000 Years. Right now those who are truly Christs Body are hidden. Hidden from others knowing they are "REAL" believers and hidden even from themselves.This is true, because Jesus said "Many will say Lord, Lord....and Jesus will say...Depart from me for I don't know you".They thought they knew Jesus, they proclaimed to Jesus "Look at our works"... But Jesus said "I do not know you".The world has only seen this true church once, 2000 years ago.We read about them in the book of Acts. The local church, and the universal church together, for the first time.Now we wait. The whole creation waits, mankind waits, for this "REAL" church to be revealed...Even God waits, for this real church being exposed to the physical churches, and to mankind. Because this will allow a separation, and later a judgment by God.Will this real church {man-child) be seen soon? I think so, for in September of 2017 the "sign of Rev CH 12 occurs in the heavens...This means "The Woman" is pregnant right now.The man-child is not Israel or Jesus...Why because ALL the events in the book of Revelation were prophetic, it is a book of prophecy (meaning future), it says so in CH 1... It was after the birth and resurrection of Jesus. So it's talking about the future.Being that a woman is pregnant for 9 months, and the birth takes place in September 2017 what will we see.Surly this child born will be mature, it won't have to grow for 33 yrs, that is why it is called the man-child...It is also the body of Christ, but plural, meaning MANY.It is not singular, as when Jesus came the first time, and that one singular body died on the cross.
