The Great Wall Street/Washington Con Job: Part 4 Of The Recovery Which Didn't Happen By David Stockman.   During the last few days we have been debunking the notion that Imperial Washington's massive monetary and fiscal stimulus caused the so-called "recovery". To the contrary, it has actually poisoned the regenerative powers of American capitalism by causing capital and resources to flow out of the main street economy and into the speculative casinos of Wall Street.

The Great Wall Street/Washington Con Job: Part 5 of The Recovery Which Never Happened By David Stockman. Posted On Friday, October 28th, 2016 In Part 4 of this series we introduced the idea that the US is now in a Say's Law Economy, which is being dragged down by a Keynesian ball and chain. That is, the traditional credit channels of monetary transmission are now broken and done owing to Peak Debt and the Fed-induced mutation of the money and capital markets into gambling casinos.

The Mother Of All October Surprises---Why The House Of Cards Will Now Come Tumbling Down By David Stockman.   FBI Director Comey's Friday afternoon letter to Congress about new email evidence was a lot more than a "bombshell". It was the equivalent of an election-cycle DEFCON 1. That's because Comey has to be a desperate man doing the very last thing imaginable. To wit, blowing up the establishment which he has obeisantly served for the last three decades.

The Most Interesting Chart In The World - Part 1 By Lee Adler.   The most important chart you may ever see on the current US market is one derived from data on the European banking system. Why would a chart of European banking data would have anything to do with the US markets? Because in this interconnected world, "liquidity anywhere is liquidity everywhere." And some of that liquidity flows to and through Wall Street sooner or later because US securities markets are the Last Ponzi Game Standing.

The So-Called OPEC Cartel Whiffs Again Marathon Talks, No Deal By Wall Street Journal. Posted On Monday, October 31st, 2016 A weekend marathon of talks between major oil producers failed to finalize plans to implement an output cut, threatening the viability of an agreement reached last month to reduce production by as much as 2%. The talks were also aimed at securing coordinated cuts with producers outside OPEC, such as Russia, the world's largest oil producer. Instead, Iraq and Iran's insistence on exemptions emerged as a big sticking point Friday as those members refused to agree to cut their burgeoning output. You need to login to view this content.

725 Days To Nowhere---A Stock Market Inhabited By Machines And Fools By David Stockman.   Way back on October 28, 2104 the S&P 500 first crossed the 2090 marker. So here we are 725 days later and it ends up smack dab where it started. And that was before anyone thought Trump was actually running or crowds were chanting "lock her up" about Hillary. It was also before the Fed had demonstrated it was fully as craven and confused as is now evident.

Construction Spending Is A Lagging Indicator and It's Sinking By Lee Adler.   The Commerce Department reported this week that total construction spending fell in September by 0.4% on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis. Economists had guessed that the figure would rise by 0.5%. This was the largest decline in the seasonally finagled headline number in 9 months.

Front-Running The Central Banks----How The Fast Money Does It By Financial Times.   A small New York hedge fund has generated double digit investment returns this year as it targets distortions in government debt markets caused by central bank bond buying. Haidar Capital, a $300m fund, has been employing a highly leveraged trading strategy to take bets in advance on bonds that it believes the European Central Bank and Bank of England intends to buy.

Phony Jobs, Phony Recovery, Phony Regime----Now Comes The Reckoning By David Stockman.   We just had another "Jobs Friday" report and the underlying message could not have been more inimical to the "all is awesome" meme of the Wall Street/Washington establishment. Nor could it have been more timely and apt on the eve of an election where Donald Trump's insurgent candidacy has a fighting chance of crossing the finishing line.

Little Known Treasury Committee Gives Us a Look At Market's Most Powerful Players By Lee Adler.   Have you ever considered how the US Treasury decides how much debt to sell each month to raise the cash it needs to pay its bills in full? If you are like 99.9% of us, probably not. But for investors and traders, it's important.

Election Day In America: The Political Earth Could Move---Trump's Route To 270 By David Stockman. Posted On Tuesday, November 8th, 2016 The political earth could move today.

Bubble Trouble At US Banks By Lee Adler. Posted On Tuesday, November 8th, 2016 Following the balance sheet data from the Fed's weekly H.4.1. and H.8 reports can be like watching grass grow for long stretches. I have pored over this data for 15 years and have sometimes wondered, 'Why bother?' The answer is that over time we can note subtle changes in pattern that lead or reveal the changes in the season of the market. Right now is one of those times.

YOU'RE FIRED! By David Stockman. Posted On Wednesday, November 9th, 2016 America's voters fired their ruling elites last night. After 30 years of arrogant misrule and wantonly planting the seeds of economic and financial ruin throughout Flyover America, the Wall Street/Washington establishment and its mainstream media tools have been repudiated like never before in modern history.

Trump's True Mission----Lance The Boil By David Stockman.   It can't be emphasized enough. On Tuesday night the Wall Street/Washington ruling elites got fired and their policies of war, debt and bubble finance got ash-canned. But Donald Trump was just the agent of the voters' dismissal order not the recipient of a programmatic mandate ala beltway briefing books or even the airy nostrums of standard party platforms.

Insufficient Liquidity For Sustained Rally In Stocks By Lee Adler.   US macro liquidity was flat again in October. Over the past 12 months, the SPX has risen 3%, while the Composite Liquidity Indicator rose by 3.7%. That they are tracking this closely is a bit unusual, but the fact that they continue to trend together over the intermediate and longer term is consistent. Even the slopes of the trends tend to be similar over longer time periods. That tends to support a bid for stocks when prices sell off. But it has been insufficient to push prices materially higher since mid-2014.

Memo To Trump: Slash Payroll Taxes For Workers, Not Income Taxes For The Elites By David Stockman.   Donald Trump needs to pivot fast on his core economic program and embrace cutting payroll taxes for the working class, not income taxes for the elites. That means jettisoning the campaign's $3.3 trillion individual income tax cut (10-years), which reflects warmed over GOP dogma about a Laffer Curve that has gone missing. He should replace it with a far bolder idea that is right for the present times and is based on far more compelling economics and super-smart politics.

Dear Mr. President- How Many Jobs Will Building a Wall Create? Part 1 By Lee Adler.   If you have ever wondered what's the best business to be in for wages and growth, there's no contest. It's doctors' offices. This includes not just the doctors, but the office staff, including nurses, medical secretaries, medical assistants, and receptionists. That little tidbit came out of a deep look I took at BLS data on job growth, current wages, and the growth of real wages during the economic 'recovery' since 2009 until last month.

Dear Mr. President- How Many Jobs Will Building a Wall Create? Part 2 By Lee Adler.   In this report, we drill down into industry subsectors to see who the biggest losers and biggest winners might be, and whether any of these smaller employment groupings offer any hope for the future. I will demonstrate to you that they do not, and that you should plan your investments accordingly.

Why The "Trump Reflation Trade" Is For Chumps By David Stockman.   If you need any evidence that the world's central banks have destroyed honest price discovery in the financial markets, the last few days have provided it in spades. The nearly $2 trillion sell-off in the global bond markets since last Tuesday was warranted but happened for the wrong reasons, while the 600 point gain in the Dow index gives stupid a whole new definition.

Wall Street's Calling The Sheep To The Slaughter Again!   We return to the fiscal theme because one thing we are endeavoring to accomplish here at Contra Corner is to stay ahead of the shocks and surprises that neither Wall Street nor the mainstream media can seem to even remotely anticipate. In that regard, we believe that the shock of Donald Trump's election will soon be vastly exceeded by an even more shocking shutdown of Washington governance within days of the inauguration.

The Trumpflation Scam And The Fiscal Bloodbath Ahead By David Stockman.   Without claiming too much credit, we think we hit the nail on the head in Trumped! We saw the Donald as the great populist battering ram that could overturn the destructive rule of the Wall Street/Washington elites, but also warned that Trump had no coherent or workable economic plan and that if elected the Imperial City would descend into chaos. That is, we never expected Trump to fix the mess, let alone make America great again.

Mainstream Media Totally Blows It On Retail Sales By Lee Adler.   "U.S. Retail Sales Rose Briskly in October" screamed the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. It was talking about the top line seasonally adjusted version of the month to month change, including inflation. Here at Contra Corner we're not really interested in what the seasonally finagled, nominal numbers say. We want the unvarnished, not seasonally manipulated truth.

Draining The Swamp 2.0: Trump Versus Reagan By David Stockman.   After nearly three decades of Bubble Finance, Wall Street is populated with stimulus addicts and gamblers, while the financial press has been reduced to a collection of megaphones, stenographers, dopes, parasites, propagandists and webbots. In that milieu, the capacity for critical thinking and historical perspective has not merely been weakened; it has been extinguished entirely.

Memo To Trump: Fire Janet Yellen Now Or The Swamp Will Take You Down By David Stockman.   During her Capitol Hill testimony last week, Janet Yellen insisted that she would serve out her full term (until January 2018) and then rather cheekily lectured Congress about the dangers of political interference with the central bank. Oh, my.

Housing Starts News A Double Edged Sword and It's Pointed Right At Us By Lee Adler.   As usual, the mainstream media spun the news on housing starts last week as great news. Indeed the numbers were strong for the month, but the data contains a hidden warning about what comes next.

This Sucker's Rally Is Done----Soon Comes The Carnage By David Stockman.   This is about as irrational as it gets. Financial markets are heading straight into a perfect storm of central bank failure, bond market carnage, a worldwide recession and a spectacular fiscal bloodbath in Washington. Investors should be heading for the hills with all deliberate speed.

Single Family Housing Starts Surge Before Long Winter of Our Discontent By Lee Adler.   Yesterday we looked at total housing starts for October. The numbers were very strong. I concluded that within those strong numbers lay the seeds of destruction. Total housing starts are comprised of single family and multi family units. The total number can be misleading about one of the two markets if one is materially stronger than the other.

Why Trump's Already In Trouble: Steve Bannon---Rightwing Statist By David Stockman.   If Steve Bannon is going to be the chief White House political and policy strategist, Donald Trump is in deep trouble before he even gets started. But the problem is not the mainstream media's baseless caricature of him as some kind of white supremacist. What's actually troubling are the views on which the liberal press gives him a thumbs up...

Existing Home Sales- Another Reason Why You Should Take the Money and Run By Lee Adler.   The Wall Street Journal reported today that existing home sales, 'rose in October for the second straight month to a new cyclical high despite rising prices and shrinking inventory, a sign housing demand remains buoyant as the year comes to a close.' The headline was less cautious.

The Bond Vigilantes Are Back----Just In Time To Stop Trumponomics By David Stockman. Posted On Friday, November 25th, 2016 Early Wednesday the yield on the 10-year US treasury note tagged 2.4o%. That means it's up 65 bps since election day and 105 bps from the post-Brexit low in July. You can call that the return of the bond vigilantes, and just in the nick of time. We have always been skeptical of the Trump economic program because it really wasn't one; it was just a collection of aspirations, quips, bromides and wrong-headed panaceas like the big infrastructure build.
