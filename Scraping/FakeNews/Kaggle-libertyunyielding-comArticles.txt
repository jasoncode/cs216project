Some of the emails that have come to the public's attention via WikiLeaks are out-and-out bombshells , while other chains are so fragmented and enigmatic that an understanding of what they portend requires reconstruction and some guesswork. 
One that fits the latter category centers on an exchange between Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta and Neera Tanden, of the hard-left Center for American Progress , concerning an apparent leak that needed — shall we say? — plugging? 
The original email was from Tanden to Podesta, dated March 8, 2015 and time-stamped 4:49 p.m. Here's the message: 
Ron Fournier is a writer for National Journal. The highlighted link in the email takes you to an article at National Journal with the intriguing title 'Emails May Be a Key to Addressing 'Pay-to-Play' Whispers at Clinton Foundation.' The article is protected by a pay wall which prevents me from providing more information, but I can tell you the subhead: 'There are not two Clinton controversies. There is one big, hairy deal.' 
Here is Podesta's response, sent a half-hour later: 
Eric Braverman, the name Podesta throws out as the likely mole, is a former CEO of the Clinton Foundation. 
Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone has posted a tweet in reaction partly to this exchange in which he advances the claim that Braverman was working with WikiLeaks and now fears assassination by the Clinton machine: Word on the street is Eric Braverman, Clinton Foundation CEO, has fled the USA and is attempting to gain asylum in Russia. Anyone confirm? 
— Stone Cold Truth (@StoneColdTruth) October 25, 2016 
How ironic that Braverman, according to the scuttlebutt, is seeking asylum from Russia, of all nations!

Communist Party USA, Democratic Socialists of America, Workers World Party, the Institute for Policy Studies, Council for a Livable World — it reads like a who's who for radical anti-Americanism. But these and other groups bent on the destruction of America as we know it are not just fringe elements on the outside looking in. They have infiltrated our government, including the halls of Congress. 
Who are they and what are their names? Both questions are answered in a riveting film by Trevor Loudon , a celebrated author, filmmaker, and political commentator from New Zealand, who has been researching the radical left for more than 30 years. 
In 'The Enemies Within,' a trailer for which follows, Loudon profiles fourteen Senators and more than fifty Representatives who seek to complete Barack Obama's fundamental transformation of the United States of America, which —Loudon argues — is the last bastion against the total suppression of freedom as we know it. 
Readers are urged to purchase a copy of this eye-opening documentary and share it with as many patriots as you can. The nation's future depends on it.

[Ed. – If this is a 'calibration error,' why is it happening only in this direction?] 
Some early voters in Texas said that when they reviewed their straight-ticket Republican selections on voting machines one significant candidate choice was changed. 
While all down-ballot names indeed reflected GOP candidates, their presidential choice showed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton instead of Republican nominee Donald Trump, the Dallas Morning News reported . 
But elections officials counter that the claims are probably false or due to user error, the paper said. More from the Morning News: 
Garland City Council member Stephen Stanley said he went to an early voting station at Nicholson Memorial South Branch Library on Tuesday morning while campaigning for candidates on the ballot. 
He said around noon a woman came out of the library and told him she had tried to vote straight ticket Republican but the machine said she had voted straight Democrat.

There has been a surge of immigrants illegally crossing into the United States leading up to next month's presidential election. 
CBS News reports dozens of immigrants have been streaming through the streets of McAllen, Texas, on a daily basis. They have been taken to a migrant center at Sacred Heart Catholic Church where they were released by Border Patrol, with ankle monitors, while they file for asylum. 
Agent Chris Cabrera told CBS News that they've been seeing a spike in immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, thanks in part to the election. 
'The smugglers are telling them if Hillary [Clinton] gets elected, that there'll be some sort of amnesty, that they need to get here by a certain date,' Cabrera said. 'They're also being told that if [Donald] Trump gets elected, there's going to be some magical wall that pops up overnight and once that wall gets up, nobody will ever get in again.' 
Cabrera added that they've encountered up to 1,000 immigrants along McAllen's stretch of the border some days.

Donald Trump's star took a beating Wednesday morning — literally. 
The reality TV host's Hollywood Walk of Fame star was destroyed by a vandal rendering the fixture completely unreadable, according to Deadline Hollywood . 
The vandal was dressed in a city construction worker, taking his sledgehammer to the five-point brass star at approximately 5:45 am. 
The man reportedly said he wanted to remove the souvenir so that it could be auctioned off, with the proceeds set to go toward helping the women who have come forward in recent weeks to accuse Trump of sexual assault. 
The allegations all came out after a 2005 recording surfaced of Trump claiming that his 'star' status allows him to grope and kiss women whenever he wants. 
While this is the first time a star has been completely defaced, Trump's has been vandalized at least twice since he announced his presidential run a year and a half ago.

Protesters blocked the upper level of the George Washington Bridge into New York City during the busy Wednesday morning rush hour, causing extensive delays in both directions of the span. 
The upper level eastbound lane was closed for 15 minutes as police arrested 10 protesters around 8:15 a.m., officials said. Delays continued to build on the George Washington Bridge as a result. 
Motorists headed to New York who earlier faced a 60 minute delay are now looking at a 90-minute wait as of 9 a.m., according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
A reporter on the bridge tweeted the protesters are demanding 'equal rights for immigrants' and 'political power for marginalized communities.' 
As of 8:55 a.m., the deomonstration has ended, according to Port Authority police spokesman Joe Pentangelo.

Pittsburgh City Council rewrote a proposed rule change that included a $500 penalty for members who talk publicly about closed-door meetings, but the new stipulation still could violate free-speech rights, an open meetings law expert said. 
Council President Bruce Kraus on Tuesday introduced legislation that revises rules governing council's operation that were last amended in 2011. Kraus of the South Side sponsored the bill with three other members. 
Council last week was prepared to introduce a version of the rules that contained a gag order and fine for members found to be in violation of attorney-client privilege by speaking publicly about private meetings known as executive sessions. Kraus said council tweaked the legislation to censure members found to be in violation of attorney-client privilege for talking publicly about private meetings with city attorneys. The rule does not define attorney-client privilege but keeps the $500 penalty. 
The previous version empowered the council president with doling out punishment to members. Kraus said that was changed to require a unanimous vote of council.

While the mainstream media has been working day and night promoting Hillary Clinton's candidacy, it has largely ignored or downplayed violent attacks against supporters of Donald Trump. 
But assaults on Trump supporters appear to be growing increasingly common as Election Day approaches and tensions intensify. Reports of Trump lawn signs and banners being stolen and defaced are everywhere on social media. 
Making matters worse, undercover video evidence emerged showing senior Democrat operatives Robert Creamer and Scott Foval acknowledging using dirty, likely illegal tricks against the Trump campaign. Their goal was to generate negative media coverage of Trump rallies by fomenting violence at them. The media eagerly used the various fisticuffs and melees the Democrats created to attempt to discredit Trump by depicting his supporters as violent, knuckle-dragging crazies. 
The videos, shot by ACORN slayer James O'Keefe's group Project Veritas Action, show Foval on camera saying his agents 'infiltrate' Trump events. 'It doesn't matter what the friggin' legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherf****er.' He adds, 'we're starting anarchy here.'

The Riverside County District Attorney's Office is seeking the death penalty against John Felix, charged with the murders of two Palm Springs police officers earlier this month, according to a press release from the DA's office. Felix previously pleaded not guilty . 
Felix, 26, allegedly shot and killed officers Jose Vega, 63 and Lesley Zerebny, 27, on Saturday, Oct. 8. Felix, described as 'self-admitted and known gang member' in the release, is believed to have ambushed the officers when they were responding to a family disturbance call. 
'This was a heinous crime involving the murders of two police officers who were gunned down simply because they were police officers,' Hestrin said in the release. 'The victims in this case were responding to a call for service and died in the line of duty protecting our community.' 
[…] 
Felix also faces three counts of attempted murder involving other Palm Springs officers, including one who was wounded by gunfire before being treated and released. Felix allegedly possessed an assault weapon, armor-piercing ammunition and was wearing a body vest.

Two chief fundraisers for the Clinton Foundation pressed corporate donors to steer business opportunities to former President Bill Clinton as well, according to a hacked memo published Wednesday by WikiLeaks. 
The November 2011 memo from Douglas Band, at the time a top aide to Mr. Clinton , outlines extensive fundraising efforts that Mr. Band and a partner deployed on behalf of the Clinton Foundation and how that work sometimes translated into large speaking fees and other paid work for Mr. Clinton. 
The memo, part of a cache of emails stolen from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, resurfaces an issue that she has had a hard time shaking: questions over the relationship between the Clintons' charity work and their personal business. 
Mr. Band and an associate introduced top corporate executives to the former president, on the golf course and elsewhere, and then asked them to contribute money to the Clinton Foundation or attend the Clinton Global Initiative, an annual foundation event.

Hillary Clinton began conducting focus groups and polling swing state voters as early as December 2014 to figure out how to brand herself and find a 'rationale' for running for president. 
Nearly two years before the election, Clinton's team circulated a timeline of research objectives for which the nascent campaign would spend $2 million on focus groups and surveys, according to recently released hacked emails. 
A 'fundamental question' was how to brand Hillary as either 'Badass/hip,' or a 'Grandma.' 
'Attached is an updated summary of the research process and a budget,' Robby Mook, who would become Clinton's campaign manager, emailed on Dec. 8, 2014. 'I want to emphasize that THIS *WILL* CHANGE because the team will have better ideas on methodology and the strategy will evolve as the project progresses.' 
'I would still assume our budget will be in the $2+ million range per my earlier memo, even though the attached budget is lower than $2 million (obviously, we are going to make this as cheap as we can without sacrificing thoroughness and quality),' he said.

Sen. Bernie Sanders laid out the ways he would leverage his popularity that emerged from the Democratic primary to continue to push Hillary Clinton to the left if she wins the presidency next month. 
In an interview published Monday with The Washington Post, Sanders argued that the Democratic Party is 'more progressive' than its presidential nominee. 
He emphasized that he saw it as his role to 'demand that the Democratic Party implement' the party platform his allies helped shape, and would be 'vigorously in opposition' if Clinton attempted to abandon the platform's progressive elements. 
'The leverage that I think I take into the Senate is taking on the entire Democratic Party establishment, and, you know, taking on a very powerful political organization with the Clinton people,' Sanders said. He then referenced the number of states he won during the primary, 22. 
'That gives me a lot of leverage, leverage that I intend to use,' he added. 
The Vermont senator also emphasized that he would not be cowed by the knowledge that his proposals would not be well received by a likely Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

On Wednesday's broadcast of 'CNN Newsroom,' MIT Economics Professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber argued that 'The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that, we need a larger mandate penalty.' 
Gruber said, 'Obamacare's not imploding. The main goal of Obamacare was two-fold. One was to cover the uninsured, of which we've covered 20 million, the largest expansion in american history. The other was to fix broken insurance markets where insurors could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they had been sick. Those have been fixed, and for the vast majority of Americans, costs in those markets have come down, thanks to the subsidies made available under Obamacare.' 
When asked about the 22% Obamacare premium increases, Gruber stated, 'the 22% increase, let's remember who that applies to. That applies to a very small fraction of people, who have to buy insurance without the subsidies that are available.'…

Students at the University of California, Berkeley held a day of protest on Friday to demand the creation of additional 'safe spaces' for transgender and nonwhite students, during which a human chain was formed on a main campus artery to prevent white students from getting to class. 
The demonstrators were caught on video blocking Berkeley's Sather Gate, holding large banners advocating the creation of physical spaces segregated by race and gender identity, including one that read 'Fight 4 Spaces of Color.' 
Protesters can be heard shouting 'Go around!' to white students who attempt to go through the blockade, while students of color are greeted with calls of 'Let him through!' 
Students turned away by the mob are later shown filing through trees and ducking under branches in order to cross Strawberry Creek, which runs underneath the bridge. 
Protesting students went on to march through the Berkeley Student Union, chanting and disrupting students who are studying.

It would be hard to imagine a Saturday night at your favorite bar or restaurant without music playing in the background. It would be equally hard to imagine a long road trip without music blasting from the car radio. But a new ruling from a judge in New York has the ability to change all of this, limiting our access music by drastically increasing music costs. 
The Department of Justice (DOJ) spent over two years reviewing its antitrust consent decrees with ASCAP and BMI, the leading music collectives that control the rights to nearly 90% of all music compositions. 
This summer, the DOJ made the sound decision to keep the decrees as-is with no alterations. 
This was the right move. The decrees have been in place for more than 75 years, allowing ASCAP and BMI to maintain their monopolies while also protecting consumers from monopoly pricing. 
Despite breaking revenue records this year, ASCAP and BMI are thirsty for more profits and lobbied DOJ to relax the consent decrees, allowing them to price gouge music copyrights the way they did before the decrees' enactment. 
ASCAP and BMI's goal was to transition to 'fractional licensing,' a process that would greatly increase their profits and make it nearly impossible for small businesses to license music. 
Under current law, known as 'whole work licensing,' a bar or restaurant that wants to license music simply goes to one of the music collectives and purchases a single license for a basket of songs. This process has worked well for decades. However, under 'fractional licensing', small businesses would have to buy the individual rights to million songs, many of which have multiple owners. 
Fractional licensing would give an owner with a 1% stake in a song the same negotiating power as an owner that had the other 99%. Negotiating usage rights with each owner would be extremely complicated, surely driving up the cost of licensing music. In fact, negotiating with the millions of copyright owners would be a full time job in and of itself, so many wouldn't business owners would be forced to raise prices or stop licensing music altogether. 
The DOJ spent years considering the long-term ramifications before it ruled on the consent decrees. The body held numerous meetings with stakeholders and offered multiple rounds of comment periods. Ultimately, they made the right decision to maintain the decrees in their current form because of the potential harm changes could make to the marketplace. 
Yet, just as a bratty child runs to Dad after Mom says no, BMI ran to the courts to appeal the decision. Unfortunately for consumers of music, a judge from the Southern District of New York ruled in BMI's favor during a pre-hearing. Unlike the two years of research and consideration the DOJ gave the case, this judge spent less than an hour before making a decision. No testimony on the 'merits' of such changes were heard before the judge released a six-page decision that would allow BMI to license music on a fractional basis. 
The judge's decision was based on his belief that the consent decrees do not specifically prohibit fractional licensing. But it was unnecessary to mention fractional licensing because the consent decrees require ASCAP and BMI to provide a license for every work in their catalogs. If the sign says the speed limit is 70 miles per hour, it doesn't mean that you can drive 80, just because the sign did not specifically say, 'Do not drive 80 mph.' 
It is very likely that the DOJ will appeal this decision. If not, it will wreak havoc on the millions of businesses that pay music — and it will deny all of us the pleasure of listening to the songs we love. 
BMI and ASCAP are make billions of dollars a year — they shouldn't be able to manipulate pricing and force business owners to select music based on licensing prices. The time is now for the DOJ to stand firm with its previous decision and do what's right for music consumers everywhere.

A top confidant to Hillary Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta suggested the person who told the former secretary of state she could use a private email should be 'drawn and quartered,' according to a leaked email chain. 
'Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email?' Neera Tanden, of the Center for American Progress, asked Podesta in a July 2015 email . The email was one of thousands released by WikiLeaks from Podesta's hacked Gmail account. 
'And has that person been drawn and quartered?' Tanden added. 'Like whole thing is f*cking insane.' 
Clinton has said former Secretary of State Colin Powell suggested she use a private email, just as he did, while serving as the U.S.'s top diplomat. Clinton also said she used a private email server for 'convenience' and it was done in accordance with State Department guidelines. Though, she did say it was a 'mistake' for her to use a private server. 
Powell, however, criticized Clinton for trying to bring him into the email issue. 
'Sad thing,' Powell wrote to a friend in a hacked email. 'HRC could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me to it.' 
'I told her staff three times not to try that gambit. I had to throw a mini tantrum at a Hampton's [ sic ] party to get their attention. She keeps tripping into these 'character' minefields,' Powell wrote, adding he tried to meet with Clinton aide Cheryl Mills to settle the issue.

You know, canoes? Those boats that you powered around the lake when you went to summer camp? Betcha didn't know they were the epitome of evil — of white privilege, genocide, and a whole host more of crimes against social justice. 
So saieth Misao Dean, professor of English at the University of Victoria in Canada, who shared her views on CBC Radio , which reveals in its intro that Dean wrote the book on the evils of canoe appropriation. Its title is 'Inheriting a Canoe Paddle: The Canoe in Discourses of English-Canadian Nationalism.' 
You can listen to the interview here , or if you have something more important to do (what could be more important?), be advised that Heat Street provides portions of the enlightening Q & A. For example, when asked whether we should look at the canoe as a non-controversial symbol or as a symbol of colonialism, Dean responds: 
Absolutely a symbol of colonialism. It seems to me that this narrative we tell ourselves about the canoe about how canoeing makes us in touch with nature, how canoeing makes us in some way guiltless of the terrible things that the Canadian government and Canadians in general did to First Nations people. 
If you prefer the dissenting view, scroll down to the comments section of the CBC Radio page, where reader Patrick Saunders opines, 'Academia has become a sit-com. A not really funny, sad-in-a-car-crash-sorta-way sit-com.' Then there's this from Kawartha Cottager: 
As soon as the ice is out of the lake I am going to head to the cottage and burn down my boat house so myself and my family will no longer be tortured by those symbols of colonialism like my canoes, kayaks and worst of all my Laser sailboat, that other symbol of colonialism. Those Euros arrived on sailboats back in the 15th century after all. Once I am done that, I will head back up the hill behind the cottage and torch my outhouse so I can destroy that ultimate symbol of colonialism…..the toilet seat. 
Well, garsh —if no one's going to take this seriously, what's a social justice warrior to do?

Douglas Band, one of former President Bill Clinton's closest advisors, boasted to outside auditors that his for-profit corporation had a 'historical role in carrying the majority of the fundraising burden' for the nonprofit Clinton Foundation. 
A Nov. 16, 2011 memo Band authored , which WikiLeaks made public Wednesday, raises disturbing questions about charitable law violations due to mixing for-profit activities with the nonprofit foundation. 
Band authored the extraordinary memo for the law firm of Simpson Thacher, in which he bragged that his for-profit Teneo raised 'well over $150 million, much of it from people who did not know President Clinton when he was in office.' 
Band co-founded Teneo with Declan Kelley who then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had appointed to serve as the U.S. Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland in 2009. 
'This is a confession of widespread fraud that must have sent Simpson Thacher into overdrive,' Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has reviewed multiple documents related to the Clinton Foundation controversy, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. 
When he wrote the memo in 2011, Band was under pressure to defend his fundraising work to the law firm, which had been retained by Chelsea Clinton to conduct a ' governance review' of the Clinton Foundation. The law firm is one of the nation's foremost authorities on ethical nonprofit management and regulation. 
Band described Teneo as devoted to 'merchant and investment banking services, corporate restructuring, public relations and communication services, and strategic advising services.' 
But he said he 'leveraged' his business activities to raise millions of dollars for the Clinton Foundation. 
'Throughout the past almost 11 years since President Clinton left office, I have sought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the foundation,' Band wrote. 
Band admitted in the memo the 'unorthodox nature of my roles' at the foundation, but he defiantly defended his work, saying: 
[R]ightly or wrongly, I believe – given the foundation's need to raise funds, the willingness of the partner owners of Teneo to help fundraise, and my historical role in carrying the majority of the fundraising burden – that Teneo should help raise funds for the Foundation, which it has. 
Ortel told TheDCNF that neither Band 'nor any of the Teneo folks ever bothered to register as professional solicitation agents in NY, or anywhere else.' The revelation could put Band and the foundation in legal jeopardy with the New York state attorney general's office, which regulate charities. 
Band also revealed for the first time the wide-ranging for-profit activities he undertook that helped enrich the Clintons. The conservative government watchdog group Judicial Watch has described Teneo as 'Clinton, Inc.' 
Band said in his memo that 'independent of our fundraising and decision-making activities on behalf of the Foundation, we have dedicated ourselves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities – including speeches, books, and advisory service engagements,' adding: 
In that context, we have in effect served as agents, lawyers, managers and implementers to secure speaking, business and advisory service deals. In support of the President's for-profit activity, we also have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, in-kind services for the President and his family – for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like. 
Former President Clinton has frequently used free corporate jets for himself and his family, including those owned by people like convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein . 
At the time Band authored his memo, Chelsea Clinton was disturbed about the ethics of mixing Band's for-profit activities with the foundation's non-profit fundraising. She retained Simpson Thacher — one of the top law firms in nonprofit management – to review all of the foundation's activities, including those of Band. 
Band lashed out against Chelsea Clinton in a number of emails to John Podesta, the former White House chief of staff under former President Clinton who is now Hillary Clinton's national presidential campaign manager.

No doubt she prefers it doused liberally with hot sauce from the bottle she carries in her purse at all times . 
It's one thing to kiss up to different voting blocs when you're running for elective office: It's the currency of politics. But when you do it in as transparently crass a manner as Hillary Clinton, you have to wonder why the other guy isn't beating her by 50 points . 
Here she is, making a guest appearance on the Univision show 'El Gordo y La Flaca.' The title translates to 'The Fat Man & The Thin Lady,' as the abuela-in-chief could on doubt tell you. See for yourself by watching the portion of the video below beginning at 2:18. As the Thin Lady addresses her audience in rápida e spañol , Clinton nods along as though she has the first clue what the woman is saying. 
Before the panderfest is over, Clinton also adds that her granddaughter is already learning Spanish , which is frankly quite an achievement since the child turned two at the end of September. 
Clinton's stomach-turning hijinks know no limits. The day after her appearance on Univision, she joined black radio host Charlamagne Tha God live on air where she claimed that rappers had influenced her fashion sense . Tha God was apparently too gracious to ask, 'What sense?'

While Donald Trump talks of repealing and replacing Obamacare and Hillary Clinton talks of reopening the conversation about the public option , the state of Vermont has begun dealing its own personal health care crisis by invoking something called the 'all-payer model.' 
The Green Mountain Care Board on Wednesday voted to approve this methodology for paying for health care, but understanding what that means requires reading the fine print of the agreement. 
By approving the all-payer model agreement, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin seeks to align incentives across Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance so health care providers are paid for keeping patients healthy, not for providing individual services and procedures. 
The board's approval makes Vermont the first state to pursue an all-payer model statewide. 
In a statement sent from the governor's office, Shumlin thanked President Barack Obama and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell for negotiating the agreement with the state, and he said the model would control health care costs and reward doctors for a more preventive approach to care. 
'Vermont will now become the first state in America to ensure that your doctor can focus on keeping you healthy, rather than running tests or procedures,' Shumlin said, adding: 
By shifting the focus away from the current fee-for-service system to one that rewards primary care and prevention, we will help Vermonters lead healthier lives and more effectively manage chronic diseases, allow doctors to better treat their patients and identify health issues before they become severe, and reduce costs in a health care system that, if left unchecked, will bankrupt our state and Vermont families. 
Green Mountain Care Board Chair Al Gobeille called the event 'an important next step in provider-led health care reform,' adding that the program will save Vermont $10 billion over the next decade. 
However, the board's action did little to address concerns raised by the Joint Fiscal Office. In a report released Friday , the JFO weighed the supposed benefits of the new system against a list of critiques and uncertainties. Among the uncertainties are the administrative costs of the program, as well as where funding will come from. 
The JFO report also notes that the next governor could refuse to go forward with the program. Republican gubernatorial candidate Phil Scott has said he does not support the program. 
In a statement sent to local media, State House Minority Leader Rep. Don Turner, criticized the plan. 
'The proposal raises many important, but unanswered, questions regarding the ability to cap healthcare cost growth, the use of the ACO model … and the competency of the Shumlin Administration to successfully run another complex regulatory system given its dismal record with Vermont Health Connect,' he said. 
Darcie Johnston, director of Vermonters for Health Care Freedom, said she was shocked at the speed with which the board approved the draft. 'Our legislators made a huge mistake in giving the GMCB so much power — the power to enter into contracts to further destroy our health care system.' 
Amy Cooper, executive director of HealthFirst, an independent practice association representing over 250 medical professionals, told Vermont Watchdog she believes 'the concept could be a good one' but nevertheless is 'nervous about the State's ability to implement it, especially with such a short timeline of reviewing the details that were only released a month ago.' 
Shumlin will sign the revised draft document at 2 p.m. Thursday in his ceremonial office in Montpelier. 
Over the past month, health care officials held public forums to explain Vermont's 44-page draft agreement with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Still, many doctors and patients feel unsure of what the 'all-payer model' will mean for them, in part because of the program's many complexities. 
For starters, despite the administration's talk of an 'all-payer waiver,' the draft document contains a waiver only for Medicare, not Medicaid or commercial insurance — the other two 'payers' in Vermont's health care system. Instead, the document gives state health care officials permission to operate accountable care organizations, or ACOs, under a restructured payment system. 
For health care providers, the new payment system will start to replace current fee-for-service payments with a state-run global budget, the goal of which is to reward positive outcomes and overall population health. 
Once the agreement is finalized, Vermont will start using its state-approved ACO, called the Vermont Care Organization. That network of health care providers is comprised of representatives from existing ACOs, including OneCare, HealthFirst and Community Health Accountable Care. 
The smaller ACOs have not yet committed to being managed by the Vermont Care Organization. They have until 2018 to decide whether to remain as fee-for-service operators or transition to global budgeting within the Vermont Care Organization, as overseen by the Green Mountain Care Board. 
Dr. Paul Reiss, chief medical officer at HealthFirst, told Watchdog his ACO is not recommending that physicians sign on with the Vermont Care Organization until details of the offer are known. 
'There's no proposal to change the way physicians are paid under Medicare in 2017,' Reiss said. 'We'll recommend signing on when there are actually offers on the table.' 
At recent public forums, both Gov. Peter Shumlin and Al Gobeille, chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, said the Vermont Care Organization would be 'risk bearing.' That means the umbrella ACO network, not individual providers, will absorb losses if providers exceed their budget for the year. 
While the risk-bearing stipulation may allay providers' worries about going over budget, page 8 of the agreement states that the ACO is responsible for 'at minimum 30 percent' of shared losses. Put another way, providers in some cases will be responsible for paying up to 70 percent of the cost of exceeding the state-determined budget. 
Delivering care under a global budget worries some doctors, who may not be able to survive under a budget cap and offer effective care at the same time. 
When an audience member at the Norwich public forum asked what impact failing practices might have on the system, Shumlin replied, 'You cannot be refused care. … It's the ACO's problem to deal with the bankruptcy. … It would not affect care in any way. It might not be the same provider, because they would be out of business theoretically, but someone would have an interest in caring for you.' 
Gobeille agreed that private practices might face bankruptcy 'because they couldn't make it work in the independent practice world.' He added that such practices could be absorbed into the hospital system. 
Since the draft agreement was announced , some physicians have criticized the plan on the grounds that hospitals may continue getting reimbursed for services at a higher rate, because of their bargaining advantage with insurance companies and the Green Mountain Care Board. 
While it's generally expected that the all-payer model will fix the payment reimbursement differential between Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurers, Reiss said he's skeptical. 
'There are no [plans] currently diagrammed on any drawing board to make that happen,' Reiss told Watchdog. 
In fact, the draft agreement doesn't fix the reimbursement differential. Instead, it says by 2020 the state must deliver 'a report on options to narrow the Payer Differential between payers.' 
The long delay could disappoint independent physicians, who have been told they don't have to join the state-run ACO if they don't want. That freedom of choice may be illusory at best, since financial pressure cited in the agreement could coerce doctors to join the network or face financial consequences. 
Specifically, the draft agreement says the state will 'encourage' providers and beneficiaries to participate. One 'encouragement' includes a potential Medicare payment reduction for practices that remain outside of the ACO. 
However, in an Oct.19 email exchange obtained by Vermont Watchdog, state Sen. Tim Ashe, told Burlington psychiatrist Robert Emmons that he contacted Ena Backus, health policy chief at the Green Mountain Care Board, and the financial penalty is now removed from the updated agreement. 
Funding to help Vermont abandon a fee-for-service model includes a one-time payment of $9.5 million dollars from Medicare. The state also has a verbal agreement with Medicaid for $200 million — likely $110 million in federal money and $90 million in state funds. 
It's unclear where this money, and the administrative expense of Vermont Care Organization, will come from. 
On Tuesday, Johnston unsuccessfully called for the board to delay its vote until outstanding questions are answered. 
'We believe that doctors and patients have significant concerns, and that the delivery of health care to Vermonters could be significantly impacted. We are concerned about the rationing of care,' the Vermonters for Healthcare Freedom director said in a statement. '…There are too many questions that deserve answers before the Green Mountain Care Board should agree to support such a risky venture.' 
Other concerns of Johnston's include a lack of transparency and the model's impact on Vermont's doctor shortage. 
A timeline of key events reveals the long road ahead for the all-payer health care model.

Who knew The Donald had those kinds of magical powers? 
Mainstream media bias took a bizarre turn Tuesday when the pro-Hillary New York Times published a report that Donald Trump is now invading the dreams of Muslim children. To illustrate that point, author Samantha Schmidt used anecdotal evidence of a child who said she had a scary dream involving the GOP nominee. 
Schmidt wrote: 
Bilal Elcharfa was pouring cereal for his children before school this month when his 7-year-old daughter, Maaria, walked into the kitchen, calling for him. 
'Baba, I had a scary dream,' she said, hugging him tight. 'About Donald Trump .' 
It was the morning after the second presidential debate, which the Elcharfa family's two youngest daughters watched in the basement of their Staten Island home with their parents. In the middle of the night, Maaria went to her parents' room twice, unable to sleep, and walked to the living room and checked her family's security camera. 
That morning, Mr. Elcharfa, 52, asked his daughter what she saw in the nightmare. 
'He was so mean to us,' she said. 'He had a scary face, like a zombie or something.' In the dream, Maaria later said, Mr. Trump came to the home of every Muslim family in the country and put each one in jail. 
'Many Muslim parents fear that the tensions could push their children away from the faith entirely. 'We don't know how to handle it sometimes,' Elcharfa is further quoted. 'Maybe someday they won't believe in anything,' Schmidt added. 
But how is this Trump's fault? Isn't it the parents' job to raise their children? 
A post at the American Thinker observed: 
Here we have an article blaming Donald Trump for terrorizing children for something he has never said or even intimated. He doesn't want to put all Muslims in jail; he just wants to reduce immigration from countries that are un-vettable in the Middle East. One does not translate into the other. 
But that assumes one deals in facts, logic, and reason. As we've seen this election season, the so-called 'mainstream media,' known here as the Democrat-media complex, have decided to toss facts, logic and reason out the window in a concerted effort to elect Democrat Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most evil person ever nominated to the White House by a major party, by any means necessary — even using propaganda the likes of which would make Josef Goebbels smile. 
There's no question — if Democrats nominated Satan, the media would worship him and call you a bigot for opposing him.

Print On a rooftop overlooking the walls of Jerusalem's Old City, around 200 American-Israeli fans of Donald Trump gathered to proclaim their support for the Republican candidate, convinced he will be Israel's best friend if elected. Wearing 'Make America Great Again' baseball caps, the small crowd, ranging from Holocaust survivors in their 80s to grinning teenagers in Trump t-shirts, said they didn't care about the sexual assault allegations against the candidate or the online anti-Semitism of some of his supporters. 'Trump will let Israel be itself and make its own decisions, that's what I like,' David Weissman, a 35-year-old from Queens, New York, who moved to Israel three years ago, said at the event late on Wednesday. 'He's not a saint, but look at his achievements. He's not afraid to identify the enemy as radical Islam, and he's not going to support the two-state solution,' he said, referring to long-standing efforts to forge peace with the Palestinians.

He claimed she had been 'forced' by teachers to memorise the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24. 
The handout read: 'Oh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you.' … 
The incident comes just weeks after parents complained to German newspaper Hessian Niedersächsische Allgemeine (HNA) that their children's nursery was refusing to acknowledge 'Christmas rituals' to accommodate the 'diverse cultures' of other pupils.

[Ed. – The earth has lost millions of species throughout its history, according to current research. You couldn't prove a catastrophic loss of wildlife since 1970 by the experience of humans; the animals are still all around us, and many of them are flourishing to the detriment of human-inhabited areas. This report sounds like the tendentious exaggeration of something that is to be expected, but is framed in alarmist terms.] 
The number of wild animals living on Earth is set to fall by two-thirds by 2020, according to a new report , part of a mass extinction that is destroying the natural world upon which humanity depends. 
The analysis, the most comprehensive to date, indicates that animal populations plummeted by 58% between 1970 and 2012, with losses on track to reach 67% by 2020. Researchers from WWF and the Zoological Society of London compiled the report from scientific data and found that the destruction of wild habitats, hunting and pollution were to blame. 
The creatures being lost range from mountains to forests to rivers and the seas and include well-known endangered species such as elephants and gorillas and lesser known creatures such as vultures and salamanders. 
The collapse of wildlife is, with climate change, the most striking sign of the Anthropocene, a proposed new geological era in which humans dominate the planet. 'We are no longer a small world on a big planet. We are now a big world on a small planet, where we have reached a saturation point,' said Prof Johan Rockström, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, in a foreword for the report.

No IT professional looking at the metadata on her emails could fail to recognize a private, freelance server. When do these repeated bombshells become so repetitive we don't even hear them anymore?] 
If this wasn't enough, the way Obama's BlackBerry is set up offers even more proof the White House knew about Clinton's email. 
President Obama's high-security BlackBerry used a special process known as 'whitelisting' that only allowed it to take calls and messages from pre-approved contacts, two former senior intelligence officials with knowledge of the set-up told Fox News – pointing to the detail as further proof the White House knew Hillary Clinton's private account was used for government business. … 
[T]he 'whitelisting' safeguard means Clinton and other contacts would have had to be approved as secure for data transmission – covering everything from emails to texts to phone calls. The Obama BlackBerry would have also been configured to accept the communications. 
'Whitelisting happens by design. The IT professionals who whitelist devices at places like the White House only add the email addresses authorized by management. To do otherwise would be to violate policy in ways that could introduce threats to the system,' Bob Gourley, former chief technology officer for the DIA, told Fox News.

This is a breaking story, and there will be time to update it later. But it's important for people to get the word out, not only that Ammon Bundy and his co-defendants have been found not guilty on all charges, but that federal marshals who were present used a Taser on Bundy's attorney, Marcus Mumford, when Mumford asked the judge to order Bundy freed, unless the feds had a detainer that would give the federal district a reason to keep him in custody. 
First, the news about the acquittals (and one hung jury outcome): 
A federal jury on Thursday found Ammon Bundy, his brother Ryan Bundy and five co-defendants not guilty of conspiring to prevent federal employees from doing their jobs through intimidation, threat or force during the 41-day occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. 
The Bundy brothers and occupiers Jeff Banta and David Fry also were found not guilty of having guns in a federal facility. Kenneth Medenbach was found not guilty of stealing government property, and a hung jury was declared on Ryan Bundy's charge of theft of FBI surveillance cameras. 
The jury didn't have to deliberate for long: 
The jury of nine women and three men returned the verdicts after five hours of deliberations on Thursday in the high-profile case that riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the federal bird sanctuary in rural eastern Oregon. 
The defendants and their legal teams were naturally thrilled and relieved. But the real drama started when Ammon Bundy lawyer Marcus Mumford asked for documentation on a pending case against Bundy in Nevada, for which a detainer would give the feds a reason to keep him in custody. 
The coda to the stunning verdict, undoubtedly a significant blow to federal prosecutors, was when Ammon Bundy's lawyer Marcus Mumford argued that his client, dressed in a gray suit and white dress shirt, should be allowed to walk out of the court, a free man. 
U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown told him that there was a U.S. Marshal's hold on him from a pending federal indictment in Nevada. 
'If there's a detainer, show me,' Mumford stood, arguing before the judge. 
Suddenly, a group of about six U.S. Marshals surrounded Mumford at his defense table. The judge directed them to move back but moments later, the marshals grabbed on to him. 
'What are you doing?' Mumford yelled, as he struggled and was taken down to the floor. 
As deputy marshals yelled, 'Stop resisting,' the judge demanded, 'Everybody out of the courtroom now!' 
Mumford was taken into custody, a member of his legal team confirmed. 
Ammon Bundy's lawyer J. Morgan Philpot, said afterwards on the courthouse steps that Mumford had been arrested and marshals had used a stun gun, or Taser, on his back. Another member of Ammon Bundy's legal team Rick Koerber, echoed Philpot, saying he heard Mumford questioning in court why they were using a Taser against him. 
Philpot decried the marshals' treatment of Mumford in the courtroom. 'What happened at the end is symbolic of the improper use of force by the federal government,' he said. 
By 6:30 p.m., Mumford was released from custody. He confirmed that he was struck with a stun gun once while he was on the floor of the courtroom. 
I would say this is unreal, except that things like this are happening far too often now. 
Mumford was merely doing what a good lawyer would do, arguing zealously for his client. There is no reason why he should have remained silent. Demanding a detainer document, if Bundy was not to be released, is exactly what any defense attorney should have done in the situation. 
The Oregon-standoff situation has been full of such unjustified high-handedness by the federal government from the beginning, and this latest event just raises the red flags again. Americans should be very alarmed at what our federal government feels entitled to do now, including federal officers disobeying a judge in her courtroom in order to manufacture an 'incident' out of nothing. 
Don't assume that word of what actually happened will get out through the MSM. Here is how the New York Times reported the marshals' rugby scrum against Mumford: 
In a sign of the tension that ran through the trial, Ammon Bundy's lawyer, Marcus R. Mumford, frustrated that the Bundys were not being released, was restrained by four United States marshals after an outburst. 
This makes it sound as if the marshals were acting under the judge's order, when in fact — according to the Oregonian account — she told them to back off after they converged on Mumford. 
One of these accounts is, essentially, a lie. I know which one my money is on. We no longer live in a world in which MSM outlets can be assumed to be acting in good faith. 
But it's up to us whether we have such a world again.

It's funny how Clinton scandals always seem to get covered up by a loss of emails. Hillary's current email scandal is not the first time this has happened to her or her hubby. During Bill Clinton's tenure in the White House, a 'glitch' (or person) turned off an automatic email archiving system causing the loss of around one million emails . The emails that just 'happened' to disappear were the same ones Kenneth Starr was subpoenaing for the Monica Lewinsky scandal and that Congress was asking for in its investigation of 'Filegate.' 
Also coincidentally, the lost emails were from the server that controlled the email accounts of President Clinton and other potential witnesses in the above scandal. The people who discovered the emails were missing were threatened with jail if they spoke about the loss. 
According to the House Oversight Committee report released in December 2000: 
The White House installed an Automated Records Management System (ARMS) to store all email correspondence in one central place, and make it easier to respond to document subpoenas. Due to a misconfiguration in the system, e-mail to about 500 White House officials was never recorded. E-mail was first discovered missing in January 1998, but the extent of the problem was not realized until later that year. 
Top White House officials were notified in June. Despite the fact that e-mail was being subpoenaed in a number of civil and criminal cases, including the Lewinsky affair and the Filegate scandal, the White House did not notify investigators that some of it was missing. In mid-February 2000, the ex-chief of White House computer operations, Sheryl Hall who had moved to the Treasury Dept. came forward with allegations that Clinton administration officials were involved in an e-mail cover-up. Betty Lambuth, working for a private employer under contract to the White House, charged that White House technicians had been threatened with loss of job, arrest, and jail if they revealed the problem. 
The White House later said the problem was resulted from an'unintentional 'glitch' and blamed it on 'human error,' attributing the problem to a 'disconnect' between technicians and lawyers who, apparently, did not realize that the computer mistake might have an effect on the pending subpoena requests.' 
Betty Lambuth, who worked for CEXEC, a subcontractor for Northrop-Grumman that ran and maintained the White House computer system, heard about the missing emails from one of her subordinates, Robert Haas. Hass audited the White House system in June 1998 because he and other technicians discovered that automated archiving system wasn't scanning and storing Internet email sent to the server used by the Executive Office of the President. Lambuth testified under oath, that when she informed the White House, Office of Administration counsel Mark Lindsay told her, 'If I or any of my team who knew about the email problem told anyone else about it we would lose our jobs, be arrested and put in jail.' 
She said Lindsay specified that she was not to tell even her private-sector boss, Steve Hawkins, who she said eventually removed her from her White House assignment when she refused to tell him about the e-mail problem. Lambuth said she and her co-workers dubbed the e-mail problem 'Project X,' [as a joking reference to the TV show 'The X Files'] and because of the threats, she and her staff took to meeting in a park close to the New Executive Office Building and in a nearby Starbucks when discussing the matter. 
Lambuth also told the court , a subordinate told her some of the emails deal with 'Vice President Al Gore's involvement in campaign fund-raising controversies' and 'the sale of Clinton Commerce Department trade mission seats in exchange for campaign contributions.' The subordinate also told her the emails also contained 'information on the White House's improper gathering of FBI background files of long-ago Republican appointees and the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal' 
A Northrop Grumman official, Joseph Vasta, testified that the Clinton-Gore White House intimidated the email contractor, into participating in the e-mail cover-up. 'Vasta testified that it was made apparent that Northrop Grumman could lose its $50 million contract if it didn't play ball with the Clinton-Gore White House.' 
Not all of the White House emails were lost– just the ones on the Mail2 server. The officials served by the Mail2 server included Doris Matsui, Marsha Scott, Sidney Blumenthal, Cheryl Mills, Bruce Lindsey, Erskine Bowles, Rahm Emanuel, Nancy Hernreich, John Podesta, Ira Magaziner, Ann Lewis, Charles Ruff, Lanny Breuer, Paul Begala, and President Clinton. 
If some of those names sound familiar, they should. People such as Sid Blumenthal and Cheryl Mills have been questioned as part of the present Clinton email scandal, and John Podesta is running Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. 
Bruce Lindsey, now the Chairman of the Board of the Clinton Foundation, was the foundation's CEO from 2003 to 2013 during Hillary Clinton's term as secretary of state which, according to Peter Schweizer's best-selling book 'Clinton Cash,' was a time when the foundation and the State Department were involved in cronyism. 
As far as the historic documents and reports remaining on the web, news about 'Project X' began to fade in October 2000 as the country approached the presidential election – perhaps, because liberal media were trying to protect then-Vice President Al Gore as he campaigned for a promotion (which sounds like the current Clinton email case, where the lefty media are doing their best to cover up the scandal). Betty Lambuth even testified that some of the missing emails involved possible Gore campaign fund-raising controversies. 
Additionally neither the documents examined nor a subsequent internet search, turned up any mention that the Project X emails dealing with the possible Bill Clinton White House scandals have have ever been recovered and turned over to the national archives. 
From Bill Clinton's Project X to Hillary Clinton's private server scandal, losing large volumes of important emails seems to run in the family.

'Look at illegal immigrants voting all over the country,' Donald Trump recently claimed in a Fox News interview, part of his ongoing effort to cast doubt on the integrity of the presidential election. There's no evidence to support the Republican nominee's claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include noncitizens. 
The latest is San Francisco, where the Nov. 8 ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the city's public schools to vote in school board elections. The right would be extended to those with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all. 'One out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesn't have a voice,' says San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, the son of Taiwanese immigrants. 'We've had legal immigrants who've had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.' Undocumented immigrants should also have the right, Chiu adds, to bypass the 'broken immigration system in this country.'

In 2012, voters in Elliott County, Kentucky, came close to breaking a streak that, at the time, had lasted 136 years. Elliott County was formed in 1869, and since its first presidential election, in 1872, it had voted for the Democratic nominee every time — the longest span of any U.S. county. 
President Obama — like the previous Democratic candidates for president — won Elliott County in 2012 , extending its streak. But the margin by which he won — 2.5 percentage points — made it, by far, the closest presidential election the county had ever seen, and the first time the Democratic share of the vote fell below 50 percent. 
Will 2016 be the end of the streak? Demographically, Elliott County looks like the kind of place where Donald Trump could do well.

Men are increasingly turning to virtual assistants to have sexually explicit conversations, it has been claimed. 
Some teenagers and 'truckers' who do not have partners are also developing feelings for female and male-voiced chatbots such as Siri , one expert said. 
Ilya Eckstein, the chief executive of Robin Labs, said his company's virtual assistant – Robin – was used by some men for up to 300 conversations a day. 
He told The Times it was 'mostly teenagers and truckers without girlfriends' who were turning to the virtual world. 
'This happens because people are lonely and bored…. It is a symptom of our society,' he said. 'As well as the people who want to talk dirty, there are men who want a deeper sort of relationship or companionship.' 
Virtual assistants – such as the iPhone's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana – are included on smartphones and computers to make life easier, allowing users to issue commands, such as 'call mum', or easily search for nearby facilities such as restaurants and petrol stations.

Shortly after the story first broke in March 2015 that Hillary Clinton had used a private email account and homebrew server during her tenure as secretary of state, the Democratic nominee went into damage control. Her first public remarks came in the form of a press avail at the U.N. , where she told reporters: 
[W]hen I got to work as secretary of state, I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two. 
She went on to emphasize that everything she did was above board and according to Hoyle. 
But despite her assurances — and perhaps as a direct consequence of her propensity for lying — the story refused to go away. Questions arose about whether any of the emails transmitted from or to her personal account contained classified information, which she vehemently denied. 
Now, thanks to WikiLeaks, an email written by her campaign's director of communications, Jennifer Palmieri , has emerged that suggests Clinton's denial may have been less than forthright. The email is dated May 22, 2015 and addresses the candidate's demeanor at another press event: 
The highlighted portion of the text seems pretty conclusive in its confirmation that her campaign team and Clinton herself knew at that early date that some of the communications in her private account had indeed contained classified data. 
Clinton has still never admitted, despite evidence to the contrary unearthed by the FBI, that she used her email to conduct affairs of state. Perhaps now she will?

More dirt on the Clinton camp in WikiLeaks's latest Podesta dump. In one email sent by Clinton soldier Brent Budowsky to the campaign chairman, Budowsky complains about what he calls the 'plan' of fellow Clinton lackey David Brock to rely on the stupidity of black voters. The controversy centers around a previous email sent to Podesta regarding a Bernie Sanders campaign ad that featured 'many black faces.' 
Here's the money portion of the email: 
Oops! Democrats have always taken the black vote and black Americans for granted. The black voting bloc has always been expected by Democratic candidates, despite the Democratic Party's long history of gross racism. One has to wonder how much damage has been caused to that relationship by the WikiLeaks revelations over the past few months. No wonder Hillary wants to drone Julian Assange!

In the final 11 days leading up to the monumental 2016 presidential election, reports have filtered in that thousands of immigrants are headed for the U.S.-Mexico border to illegally enter the United States. Their motivation is crystal clear, according to CBS News York , which explains the sudden influx: 
'The smugglers are telling [the masses of illegal] if Hillary [Clinton] gets elected, that there'll be some sort of amnesty, that they need to get here by a certain date,' [Border Patrol Agent Chris] Cabrera said. 'They're also being told that if [Donald] Trump gets elected, there's going to be some magical wall that pops up overnight and once that wall gets up, nobody will ever get in again.' 
Cabrera added that they've encountered up to 1,000 immigrants along [the Texas city of] McAllen's stretch of the border some days. 
It's not just Donald Trump's imagination that Democrats are manipulating the immigration process to register as many Hillary Clinton voters as possible. Bloomberg notes independently that a number of American cities are opening allowing illegals to vote. In some cases, an ad hoc workaround is being impemented to give the process an air of respectability.

Last week, the UN's premier cultural agency, UNESCO, approved a resolution viciously condemning Israel (referred to as 'the Occupying Power') for various alleged trespasses and violations of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Except that the resolution never uses that term for Judaism's holiest shrine. It refers to and treats it as an exclusively Muslim site, a deliberate attempt to eradicate its connection — let alone its centrality — to the Jewish people and Jewish history. 
This Orwellian absurdity is an insult not just to Judaism but to Christianity. It makes a mockery of the Gospels, which chronicle the story of a Galilean Jew whose life and ministry unfolded throughout the Holy Land, most especially in Jerusalem and the Temple. If this is nothing but a Muslim site, what happens to the very foundation of Christianity, which occurred 600 years before Islam even came into being? 
This UNESCO resolution is merely the surreal extreme of the worldwide campaign to delegitimize Israel. It features the BDS movement (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions), now growing on Western university campuses and some mainline Protestant churches. And it extends even into some precincts of the Democratic Party.

Joe Biden is at the top of the internal short list Hillary Clinton's transition team is preparing for her pick to be secretary of state, a source familiar with the planning tells POLITICO. 
This would be the first major Cabinet candidate to go public for a campaign that's insisted its focus remains on winning the election, and perhaps the most central choice for a potential president who was a secretary of state herself. 
Neither Clinton, nor her aides have yet told Biden. According to the source, they're strategizing about how to make the approach to the vice president, who almost ran against her in the Democratic primaries but has since been campaigning for her at a breakneck pace all over the country in these final months. 
'He'd be great, and they are spending a lot of time figuring out the best way to try to persuade him to do it if she wins,' said the source familiar with the transition planning.

Will shake things up 
Media ratings magnet / Likely to steal all the thunder 
Since Trump's June 2015 announcement speech, every word or phrase listed above describes what the American electorate witnessed or felt during the campaign because, as I said, Trump's consistency has been uncanny. 
Now, let's now examine three quotes from the speech and then refer back to the list. All three reinforce the premise in my headline. But it was the following statement that haunted Trump's campaign from the second the words left his mouth: 
When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people. 
Watching Trump say that on live television, I immediately thought, 'There goes the Hispanic vote!' The fact is demographic voter data shows that for a Republican to be elected president, he or she must win at least 47% of the national Hispanic vote. Then poof, in one 20-second rant, Trump destroyed all the Republican Party's Hispanic outreach rendered since Romney won only 27% of the Hispanic vote in 2012. 
From the 'impression list,' Trump's inartful Mexican statement branded him with 'lacks a political filter,' and 'lacks presidential demeanor' to put it mildly. These two major negative 'branding phrases' may have begun with his much-maligned Mexican comments, but later applied to numerous Trump-isms which popped up over the last year slowly undermining and unraveling his chances of ever winning 270 electoral votes. 
Next is a Trump foreign policy gem about terrorism: 
Islamic terrorism is eating large portions of the Mideast. They've become rich. I'm in competition with them. 
What the #@& does that mean? Let's go to the 'impression list' where we apply incoherent, inarticulate, uninformed, and desperately in need of a speech writer , to name just a few. And once again, repeat after me: 'Aall we need to know we learned….' 
For my last selection, I chose an example of how Trump, right out of the starting gate, tried to antagonize and denigrate other Republican presidential candidates (and later high-ranking party leaders.) It is important to note that Trump made the following statement within the first minute of his announcement speech: 
The other candidates — they went in, they didn't know the air conditioning didn't work. They sweated like dogs. They didn't know the room was too big because they didn't have anybody there. How are they gonna beat ISIS? I don't think it's gonna happen. 
Yikes! That nonsensical statement exploded the 'impression list.' It was the opening act of an obstinate candidate who, we found out too late, is totally resistant to change even after his campaign began its slow-motion meltdown. 
Sadly, Trump's announcement speech stands as living proof that he flunked kindergarten etiquette. Circling back to Flughum's theory, during his campaign, Trump never learned to clean up his own mess and has never said he was sorry after hurting someone (or a group of someones.) 
In the end, Trump's likely defeat will be written off as an historical fluke. He will be viewed as a charismatic, untested, one-time outsider candidate who spearheaded a successful movement of fed-up voters. Through his celebrity status, he managed to parlay mass frustration into winning the Republican presidential nomination but, along the way neglected to learn the basics of kindergarten-level political behavior.

In his 29 years in prison, David Bonner has mopped floors, cooked hot dogs in the cafeteria and, most recently, cut sheets of aluminum into Alabama license plates. 
The last job paid $2 a day — enough to buy a bar of soap at the commissary or make a short phone call. 
'This is slavery,' said Bonner, who is 51 and serving a life sentence for murder. 'We're forced to work these jobs and we get barely anything.' 
He was speaking on a mobile phone smuggled into his 8-by-12 foot cell in Alabama's Holman Correctional Facility, where he and dozens of other inmates were on strike. 
David Bonner, an inmate at Alabama's Holman prison, went on strike from his job last month at a factory on prison grounds where inmates manufacture state license plates. (Alabama Dept. of Corrections) 
They're among a growing national movement of prisoners who have staged work stoppages or hunger strikes this fall to protest dismal wages, abusive guards, overcrowding and poor healthcare, among other grievances. 
Prisoners' rights activists say the coordinated effort is one of the largest prison protests in modern history, drawing in at least 20,000 inmates in at least 24 prisons in 23 states.

After all those scam phone calls — and threats we'd be arrested if we didn't pay up — many of us just knew that it wasn't really the IRS on the line. But who was it? And when would the authorities ever catch these jerks? 
And could somebody please make those awful calls stop? 
At last, we're hearing about a major break in the case. After a three-year joint investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice obtained an indictment involving 56 alleged fraudsters based in the United States and also five call centers in India, all accused of tricking people into paying fake tax bills either by wire or placing money on prepaid cards. 
The United States will be seeking the extradition of those based in India and warned others engaged in similar schemes. 
The indictment accuses the U.S. arm of the network of grabbing the cash off the prepaid cards and then laundering the money. It also accuses fast-talkers at the call centers of tricking victims into thinking they were talking to the IRS — or authorities from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

The number of migrants sleeping rough on the streets of Paris has risen by at least a third since the start of the week when the 'Jungle' shanty town in Calais was evacuated, officials said. 
Along the bustling boulevards and a canal in a northeastern corner of Paris, hundreds of tents have been pitched by migrants – mostly Africans who say they are from Sudan – with cardboard on the ground to try and insulate them from the cold. 
While the presence of migrants there is not new, it has grown substantially this week, Colombe Brossel, Paris deputy mayor in charge of security issues, told Reuters. … 
Between the Stalingrad and Jaures Paris metro stations, migrants who spent the night camped out on the median strip of a major road, with traffic passing on either side, had scattered on Friday morning, many carrying their tents while police patrolled the center of the boulevard. 
Migrants and officials said police checked ID papers and asylum requests and later let the migrants return to the central reservation of the avenue where they put their tents back up. 
'There's a lot of new people here,' said Mustafa, 21, from Darfur, as he waited on the side of the road.

It takes a lot for the FBI to reopen an investigation. It takes even more for the FBI to reopen an investigation of a presidential candidate eleven days before the election. But that's exactly what has happened. 
Early this afternoon it was announced that the FBI was reopening the criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton's conduct as secretary of state, with regard to her email server and America's secrets. And don't listen to any Clinton surrogates who say it's not a criminal investigation. The FBI doesn't do any other kind of investigation. 
The first inkling of the news was a tweet from Rep. Jason Chaffetz : 
FBI Dir just informed me, "The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation." Case reopened 
— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 
About ten minutes after Chaffetz's tweet came this letter from FBI Director James Comey to congressional leaders: 
The new information didn't come from WikiLeaks, according to the New York Times ; it came from Hillary Clinton ultra-confidante Huma Abedin (thanks to the sexting scandal investigation involving her estranged husband). Federal law enforcement officials confirmed Friday that the new emails uncovered in the closed investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server were discovered after the FBI seized electronic devices belonging to Abedin. 
We don't know when this new criminal investigation will be over, or what exactly the new material is. However, in this highly charged political year less than two weeks before Election Day, Comey would not reopen the criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton and do it so publicly unless he thought it was significant. Whether this will have any effect on people's vote is also unknown. It may be that this kind of news is already baked in to people's attitudes about Clinton. We shall see. Either way, if you are a Trump supporter, it can't hurt.

'Premiums will go up sharply next year under President Barack Obama's health care law, and many consumers will be down to just one insurer, the administration confirmed Monday.' The Associated Press explains at this link . Arizona will see the biggest spike (a whopping 116 percent), while Oklahoma will see a spike of 69 percent and Tennessee, Minnesota and Alabama will see spikes around 60 percent. The national average will be about 25%, the Obama administration says. 
Mary Katharine Ham recently wrote a column titled ' My Defective Obamacare Health Insurance Product Just Blew Up . Last year, her insurance plan's cost went up 'by almost 60 percent.' The plan had been purchased on the Affordable Care Act 'marketplace.' This year, things got much worse: 
My premium is going up 96 percent. Ninety-six percent . My monthly payment, which was the amount of a decent car payment, is now the size of a moderate mortgage. The president refers to these for thousands of citizens as 'a few bugs' when to us it feels like a flameout. 
For this astronomical payment, I get a plan with an astronomical deductible that my healthy family of three will likely never hit except in the most catastrophic of circumstances. 
Before Obamacare, she, like many other people , had a better plan at a lower price: 
During the run-up to Obamacare, President Obama referred to these plans as 'junk' plans, but my family and I received perfectly good care and service through them. We were responsible, healthy citizens consuming a small amount of health care, paying out of pocket for most of it, and making sure we weren't deadbeats should something catastrophic come to pass. Our health insurance was a rational and responsible purchase. 
But thanks to Obamacare, that plan no longer exists, even though Obama got Congress to approve Obamacare by falsely claiming that 'If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.' (A claim that even biased left-leaning fact-checker PolitiFact later called the ' lie of the year .') 
As Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute noted in the Chicago Tribune, 
Obamacare inflation impacts everyone. August saw the biggest monthly gain in prices for medicine, doctor appointments and health insurance since 1984. . .The average employer-sponsored family policy now costs more than $18,000 a year. 
That means family coverage costs $4,400 more today than before the health law passed in 2010. So much for President Barack Obama's promise families would save $2,500 a year. 
Further, the Government Accountability Office found the Obamacare website is a magnet for fraud. The office created 14 fictitious enrollees who were approved for $60,000 in health insurance subsidies. 
Turner argues that an expansion of Obamacare recently proposed by Hillary Clinton would 'double down' on its failures, replicating on a much larger scale the flaws of the 'health insurance cooperatives concocted by Obamacare. The co-op program cost taxpayers $2.4 billion, but 17 of the 23 state co-ops have failed.' 
Obamacare has already reduced employment in most states by between 1.5% and 3%, according to Georgetown University's Tomas Wind. The 'healthcare law will slow economic growth over the next decade, costing the nation about 2.3 million jobs and contributing to a $1 trillion increase in projected deficits, the Congressional Budget Office said in a report released' in 2014 .

[Ed. – Videos are starting to come out, like the one here . Reportedly, it took 40 police officers to gain control of the situation.] 
An Israeli speaker's talk at a London college campus scheduled for this week was canceled on Wednesday. Why? Because, according to the cancelation notice sent by the student union, 'there had been controversy' when he spoke at the campus two years prior, and the hosting organization failed to disclose that when the room was booked for the talk. 
After cries of suppression of speech and vehement protests, the university stepped in and 'un'canceled the talk. Hen Mazzig's talk at University College, London, was reinstated. It would take place, as scheduled, on Thursday evening, Oct. 27. 
The response by the anti-Israel mob was swift and the attack was vicious. A protest was called. Outside the room where Mazzig was scheduled to speak, livid demonstrators screamed for murder and the end of Israel. 'Intifada, Intifada!' and 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!' They barred the entrance to the talk while pummeling the doors and windows, leering malevolently. Two thugs yanked open a window, hurling themselves into the room, launching several students inside into panic attacks. A woman inside kept repeating: 'This is like the Warsaw Ghetto!'

[Ed. – Lawmakers are saying she's basically 'pleading the Fifth.' But it appears to be more than that, if her deputy is warning members of Congress about publicly disclosing what they know about the payments. There cannot be any justification for that.] 
Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by [mis]leading members of Congress about the Obama administration's secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has 'pleaded the Fifth' Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon . 
Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. 
In an Oct. 24 response , Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch's behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran. 
The response from the attorney general's office is 'unacceptable' and provides evidence that Lynch has chosen to 'essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding [her] role in providing cash to the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism,' Rubio and Pompeo wrote on Friday in a follow-up letter to Lynch, according to a copy obtained by the Free Beacon .

[Ed. – Suddenly, Newsweek cares that the Hillary case might be politicized? When Comey and the media have been politicizing it all along, by giving Hillary special treatment that no one else on earth would have gotten in the same circumstances?] 
Why did FBI Director James Comey shock Washington on Friday with an announcement that the FBI 'has learned of the existence of emails' related to Hillary Clinton's private email server, and what does it mean? 
The truth is Comey didn't have a choice. Because the new information followed his sworn testimony about the case, Comey was obligated by Department of Justice rules to keep the relevant committees apprised. 
Under oath Comey had stated that the bureau had completed its review. Once he learned that there were new emails that required examination, Comey had to notify Congress that he had to amend his testimony because it was no longer true. … 
Had Comey not told Congress and it emerged after the election that new materials had come into its possession, the director and his entire agency's credibility might have been questioned. 
In his letter, Comey did not use the phrase being touted by Republicans that the case had been reopened. Technically it was never closed.

[Ed. – Don't know if Dutch law can/will compel his attendance. Most nations' laws provide for being tried in absentia, but in Western nations, it's not usually because the defendant refuses to be there.] 
Defiant Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders said Friday he will refuse to attend his hate speech trial next week, dubbing it a travesty aimed at silencing him as the country prepares for 2017 elections. 
The trial opens on Monday before a three-judge bench with the far-right politician facing charges of insulting a racial group and inciting racial hatred for comments he made about Moroccans living in the Netherlands. 
'It is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country,' Wilders said in a statement Friday, dubbing the case 'a political trial, in which I refuse to cooperate'. 
It comes as opinion polls have shown his far-right Freedom Party (PVV) doing well ahead of March elections. … 
Set to last until November 25, the trial focuses on a comment made at a March 2014 rally when Wilders asked supporters if they wanted 'fewer or more Moroccans in your city and in the Netherlands?' 
When the crowd shouted back 'Fewer! Fewer!' Wilders answered: 'We're going to organise that.'

The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint Friday against FBI Director James Comey with the Department of Justice, alleging interference with the 2016 presidential election. 
The coalition, an arm of the Keep America Great PAC, filed the complaint with the DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility, after Comey announced to Congress that because of new emails discovered on Huma Abedin's electronic devices relevant to the Hillary Clinton email investigation, the agency would review those emails and assess their relevancy to the investigation . 
For Scott Dworkin, senior advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, the announcement is evidence that Comey, a registered Republican, is attempting to undermine Clinton's chances of taking the White House. 
In a statement, Dworkin submitted: 
It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election. It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton. 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump has filed numerous complaints with federal agencies about figures connected to the 2016 election. 
On Monday, the group filed a complaint with the FBI against Donald Trump himself for allegedly violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In other words, the group thinks Trump has called for voter intimidation and suppression on a national level. 
Earlier in October, the group also filed a complaint against the Trump campaign and political strategist Roger Stone, saying both were involved with WikiLeaks and also a 'foreign government' behind the hacks that lead to the release of emails from John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chair. 
Podesta referred to the FBI's Friday announcement as 'extraordinary.' 
'It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election,' Podesta said . 'The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining.' 
In July, after the FBI came to a conclusion on Clinton's private email server and said that no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with criminal charges, the Clinton campaign praised Comey as a 'well-respected Republican who served as George W. Bush's Deputy Attorney General.' 
Brian Fallon, press secretary for the Clinton campaign, shamed Republicans in September , particularly GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley , for 'trying to bully the FBI into serving partisan interests.'

Of all the weeks to turn in a late Follies post from your LU Football Commentary Service. 
We've already had two outcomes for our Inner Circle (more below, in case you're still in suspense). 
But we're also in a position to ask the eternal question: if Cal and USC play and no one pays attention, did anything happen? (FWIW, USC won, 45-24. Another Storied Rivalry settled for 2016. Cal ballcaps back in the closet, folks.) 
Next week: CFB rankings to lampoon. 
Tennessee whupped up on Jacksonville Thursday night in the pros. As nature seems to have intended this year. Get a defense, Jags. 
Inner circle 
The University of Tulsa Golden Hurricane (4-2), which beat Notre Dame 28-27 on 30 October 2010, will be at Memphis Saturday for an American West showdown. The Tigers are giving 6.5, but we think TU has a better shot than that. Should be a good game. 
Oklahoma, holding steady at #16, hosts Kansas (motto: 'What difference, at this point, does it make?') on Saturday evening, while laying a ridiculous 40.5. Has the betting fraternity been held in isolation for the last six weeks? Kansas isn't nearly as bad as they were a year ago, and Oklahoma's defense couldn't stop a gum-wrapper chain if it were barreling down the field. Anything could happen, but this is just the sort of situation where Oklahoma ends up struggling in the final 2 minutes to stay on top of a 3-point lead. We'll believe 40 when we see it. 
Oklahoma State gets to host #10 West Virginia, pride of the Big 12, in Stillwater early Saturday. As befits a ranked visitor facing a Gundy squad, the Mountaineers are giving, but not a lot – 3.5. That said, WVU could well find a way to rattle Cowboy QB Mason Rudolph. Game by game, the Mountaineers have tended to be a one-trick pony on defense this year, but they keep finding the right trick to get the job done. 
New #22 Navy will be squaring off with South Florida at Ray-Jay in Tampa by the time this goes to post. The 6-2 Bulls top the American East at the moment, while 5-1 Navy leads the American West, so there will be a lot of talk about a conference-champ preview. The Bulls scored 35 on Florida State in a wild early-season loss, but just took a bad dive last game against Temple. They're favored by 6, but Navy's likely to cover. (Umm. Well, any minute now, Navy's going to start getting in the same hemisphere as 'covering.' Good grief, Navy's secondary just can't keep up with these guys.) 
Army will be in Winston-Salem to take on Wake Forest Saturday, on the short end of 7. Wake could more than cover, but Army took a drubbing from North Texas last week, and will be out for blood. Key week to see if this year's Black Knights are for real. 
Air Force , also coming off a painful loss to Hawaii, heads to Fresno State Friday evening for the late game. Falcons give 14.5. We think the Bulldogs will cover. 
Virginia Tech , back at #25 (for now), knocked off Pitt 39-36 in a rock-'em-sock-'em slugfest last night in Pittsburgh. Hard-fought battle with major yardage on both sides, but some intermittently impressive defense poking through as well. See what you can do, Hokies, when you don't eat yourselves alive with penalties and turnovers? 
Nevada , we're happy to say, has the week off. New #19 LSU is off this week as well, preparing for the rivalry bout with Alabama next week. 
For all you offense fans out there, TCU hosts Texas Tech on Saturday. We, personally, are going to be extremely disappointed if the combined total points clock in anywhere south of 130. Toads give 9.5. 
Kansas State is off to Iowa State to see what the Wildcats can do with the 1-6 Cyclones' bad habit of losing. K-State is 4-3 and a solid shot for a bowl bid – but, still facing OK-State, Baylor, rival KU, and TCU down the stretch, they really want to add to the 'W' column this weekend. 
Toledo is our other Thursday night winner, because we just know they had a Great Learning Experience coming in second to Ohio last night (31-26, for those with a thirst for data). Apparently it's been quite a while since the Bobcats won in Toledo. Seemed to be all anybody could talk about. Rockets go to 6-2; their biggest conference game at division-leader (and #20) Western Michigan will be Thanksgiving week, and when they win that one, they may just get another crack at Ohio for the MAC crown. 
Wyoming hosts #13 Boise State, and it's a measure of the Cowboys' improved performance this year that the Broncos are only laying 13.5. It wouldn't surprise us, exactly, for the Pokes to cover. 
Top 10 
#1 Alabama is off, preparing as any sensible team would to meet LSU. 
New #2 Michigan heads to East Lansing for something they've been wanting to do since 2012: win the Paul Bunyan Trophy back from Michigan State. This is the year they can do it. The Wolverines give 24 at the moment. The 2-5 Spartans will play them tough, of course, but we're figuring on Blue from out here in the cheap seats. And who cares if the trophy looks like a manly man's Hummel figurine? There's nothing foofy about, you know, collecting. 
In default of better options, Clemson is cycling back through #3, and takes on #12 FSU in Tallahassee, in the marquee slot on Saturday evening. Tigers give only 4, even though the 'Noles haven't been all that, recently. The one and only Paul Bunyan Trophy, in play once more. (Image: Wikipedia) 
New #4 Washington is at #17 Utah, giving 11. 
New #5 Louisville heads to Charlottesville with a gift of 33 for hapless Virginia. 
New #6 Ohio State, which owes us all an apology for upsetting the top 10 in this incontinent way, hosts Northwestern, giving 27.5. 
New #7 Nebraska will be at #11 Wisconsin, facing the real probability of losing top 10 standing in their Storied Rivalry game, not to mention the Freedom Trophy. Which may be Just A Trophy, but is discreetly attractive at least. Badgers give 9.5. Why they fight. (Image: UW Athletic Communications via Fox Sports) 
New #8 Baylor is at Texas, giving 3.5, and better watch its six. 
#9 Texas A&M hosts New Mexico State, which makes for a meeting of Aggies but doesn't seem to have a lot of other merits. A&M is laying 43.5. 
Best of the rest 
We can't vouch in advance for the football, but it's always an exciting weekend when Florida (#14) and Georgia meet in their Storied Rivalry to fight for the Okefenokee Oar. 
#15 Auburn at Ole Miss might be kind of interesting. Miami at Notre Dame holds possibilities, featuring a tight 1.5-point spread (Arsh) and the usual primo slot on the Notre Dame Broadcasting Channel. The Okefenokee Oar's glamour shot from its Facebook page. 
Other ranks 
In FCS, McNeese State hosts Abilene Christian for the Cowboy Homecoming on Saturday evening. Abilene Christian is 1-7 and sucks royally, but they are coming off their one win (over Incarnate Word), and McNeese has whiffed on some softballs this season. But Go Pokes! 70s and clear for the 6 PM game start. 
In Div II, Slippery Rock (5-3) heads to Clarion to take on PSAC rival Clarion U. on Saturday. The Eagles are 2-6 and have already had their obligatory losses to ranked powerhouses California U. (PA) and IUP. We don't want to say it's cake for Clarion from here on, but we do suspect SRU may be a tad more motivated. Little Clarion P-A (pop. 5,000) is northeast of Pittsburgh (and Slippery Rock), and just southwest of the Allegheny National Forest, where it will be in the 60s and clouding up something fierce for the noon kickoff. 
In Div III, Rose-Hulman , AKA The Bomb, is now 6-2 and perched atop the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference after the epic win over Franklin. The Fightin' Engineers host Bluffton U. (OH) in Terre Haute on Saturday, in a game that could be a showstopper. The Beavers come in 6-1 (4-1 conference), and although they lost to Franklin, they beat RHIT's archrival Mt. St. Joe in September. Fight hard, Engineers. 70s and overcast for the 1:30 PM kickoff. 
Christopher Newport , now 5-2 after the owwie at Frostburg State, could do itself some major good hosting Salisbury U. (MD) for Homecoming Saturday night. Salisbury (6-1) is second in the NJAC, behind Frostburg, but also ranked #17 in the Coaches' Poll. See how easy? Vault Salisbury and Wesley (which CNU beat a few weeks ago) in the NJAC, and maybe surge back into the top 25. Well, it's a goal. Topping out at 70, with clear skies, for the 4 PM game start. 
Merchant Marine has the week off. 
Pros 
Our Redskins lead us off Sunday morning, playing Cincinnati at the ungodly hour of 6:30 AM PDT because they'll be at Wembley Stadium in London. Bengals give 3. 
New Orleans hosts Seattle (-2.5) in the (godlier) early slot. 
San Diego and Denver are going to get right back on that horse in Sports Authority at Mile High, and we'd like to see the Broncos do something with their 4-point give this time. They did wallop the Texans, for what that's worth. 
Dallas has a big one coming up Sunday night, hosting Philly in Arlington. The 5-point Cowboy advantage isn't completely unjustifiable. 
Steelers have the week off. 
Monday night gives us Minnesota (-4.5) at Chicago.

[Ed. – It does seem a bit thoughtless of the Italians, to have not at least arranged to clothe the migrants from the couture designers' off-the-rack lines.] 
African migrants who took the streets in protest and blocked traffic in Venice this week have been demanding designer clothes, the president of the Cooperativa Sociale Onlus has revealed. 
Lorenzo Chinalleto, whose cooperative hosts migrants at the Hotel Byron in the Venice province, said migrants respond with displeasure when receiving clothes from Catholic charity Caritas and other charitable bodies, because the goods are unbranded. 
He explained: 'Unfortunately they come to Italy with the asylum reception systems of northern Europe as a model. When they arrived we gave them clothes, standard clothes. 
'But they want brand-name clothes like Armani and Boss, and they asked for Pirelli shoes. These are their models. When they came to us, they didn't have clothes, but they all had smartphones,' the Italian added . 
Forty of the migrants hosted at the Hotel Byron took to the streets to express their dissatisfaction, blocking the traffic. In a video taken outside the hotel on Monday protesters can be seen shouting, in English, that they don't want to eat pasta. The migrants originate mostly from Senegal, Nigeria, Somalia, Mali and Ghana, Il Gazzettino reported .

[Ed. – Far from striking any blows with this move, the administration actually craps on both U.S. credibility and the making of foreign policy by the U.S. federal government. There were two and only two correct ways to behave in this situation. One, vote against the resolution and veto it on the UNSC. Two, change U.S. policy the lawful way, by putting legislation through Congress and crafting a government agreement to end the embargo. The Obama administration chose to be passive-aggressive — and therefore slimy, weasely, and dishonorable. Exit question: was this betrayal of both the American and Cuban people a signal of what may be in store for Israel , and a pending UN resolution 'condemning settlements'?] 
For the first time ever, the United States abstained from voting on a United Nations resolution condemning America's embargo on Cuba. 
This breaks decades of bipartisan support for U.S. law on the international stage. It shows just how far the Obama administration is willing to take its misguided and ill-informed Cuba policy. 
For the past quarter century, the Castro regime annually introduced a U.N. General Assembly resolution blaming America's trade embargo for the island's chronic economic and social problems and calling for the end of the embargo. Until Wednesday, the U.S. has always voted against the resolution, often standing virtually alone in defense of human rights and democracy for the Cuban people.

It looks like the vaunted air space coordination between the U.S. and Russia in Syria isn't producing a safe flying environment. 
U.S. officials said Friday that a Russian fighter 'flew dangerously close' to a U.S. warplane in eastern Syria on 17 October – something that can't possibly be unavoidable, in light of the prior agreement by Russia and the U.S., in 2015, to deconflict air operations there. 
The AFP report provides this description: 
The near miss occurred late on October 17, when a Russian jet that was escorting a larger spy plane manoeuvred in the vicinity of an American warplane, Air Force Lieutenant General Jeff Harrigan said. 
The Russian jet came to 'inside of half a mile', he added. 
Another US military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the American pilot could feel the turbulence produced by the Russian jet's engines. 
'It was close enough you could feel the jet wash of the plane passing by,' the official said. 
It appeared the Russian pilot had simply not seen the US jet, as it was dark and the planes were flying without lights. 
'I would attribute it to not having the necessary situational awareness given all those platforms operating together,' Harrigan said. 
One is tempted to go heavy on the sarcasm, in response to that. 
But OK. AFP offers a bit of analysis: 
The incident raises serious questions about the extent to which pilots are able to track the complex airspace they operate in. 
Well, sort of. Basically, there are two separate networks exercising command and control over the same air space – and that's your problem, right there. Add to it the likelihood that the Russians are not squawking IFF in a way that U.S. systems can interpret, and you have the potential for a nice fecal focaccia. 
Looking at the air command/control assets that seem to be available for operations, there shouldn't have to be a safety or awareness issue, at least not during planned air strike and air support operations. When they have aircraft operating, both coalitions, Russian and U.S., have the technical means to maintain good, fine-grain air pictures in the area in question. (The general area the encounter occurred in can be inferred from where the U.S. coalition conducted air strikes on 17 October . See map.) Locations of coalition air strikes in Syria on 17 Oct 2016. The locations at Ayn Isa, Abu Kamal, Al Shaddadi and possibly Palmyra could qualify as 'eastern' Syria, the region reported for the close air encounter. If the Russian fighter was escorting the Tu-214R, the night Russian commanders expected to see ISIS fighters making their way into Syria, the easternmost area where Al-Shaddadi and Abu Kamal — or Al-Bukamal — are located would be the most likely. (Google map; author annotation) 
The Russians have their S-300 and S-400 radars and command vehicles, along with the radars and command center of the Syrian national system. Russia has also operated the A-50 Mainstay AWACS over Syria since December 2015, although there's no way to know if it was operating on 17 October. The A-50 isn't forward-based in Syria, but rather operates out of Mozdok in southern Russia. (It may well have been operating that night, given the other things going on.) 
The U.S. coalition has E-2C Hawkeyes from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69) airwing, which come up from the Persian Gulf to support operations in both northern Iraq and eastern Syria.

The U.S. coalition can also interoperate right now with E-2Cs from FS Charles de Gaulle , which has been in the Eastern Mediterranean , and flying its airwing over Syria, since September. It's not clear where Charles de Gaulle 's E-2Cs are flying, but they are capable of providing interlocking air space coverage with Ike 's E-2Cs, when both are airborne. French carrier FS Charles de Gaulle. (File image via Le Parisien) 
Working with de Gaulle on 17 October were also two destroyers, USS Ross (DDG-71) and FS Chevalier Paul , one or both of which would have been able to track Russian aircraft to some distance inland over Syria. (Their more-constant but less extensive air picture(s) would complement and enhance that of the airborne Hawkeyes.) 
These operational-level assets keeping up an area air picture supplement the on-scene information an individual aircraft has from its own radar system, as well as enabling the air defense command/control platform to keep each aircraft under combat direction. 
At the time of the encounter, U.S. and French systems had the ability to know where Russian aircraft were, even if the Russians had to be identified by default, rather than by positive confirmation from Identification Friend or Foe (IFF). (The Russians, recall, up in the Baltic, have been going out of their way to not 'squawk' IFF in good faith where NATO systems can detect it. They presumably reserve the right to behave the same way over Syria. From what U.S. officials have sometimes been careful not to say, it sounds to me like that's what they're doing. That said, there aren't so darn many unidentified aircraft zorching around over Syria at 500 knots that it would have to take very long to know you've got either a Russian or a Syrian jet fighter.) 
Russian systems also had the ability to know where U.S. coalition aircraft were on 17 October. It's not credible to claim that they had no awareness. And they probably had the IFF codes of those aircraft, and knew whose they were, since the coalition is presumably squawking as per normal. 
The 'incredibility' of the claim that the Russian aircraft 'couldn't see' the U.S. warplane is compounded by the fact that the Russian fighter was said to be escorting a 'large spy plane.' This was probably the Tu-214R , Russia's newest, uniquely capable airborne ISR platform, with a sensor suite somewhat similar to the U.S. E-8 JSTARS. If the Russian fighter escort really didn't know that a U.S. fighter was within weapons range of the 'spy plane,' the fighter pilot's head should have been delivered on a platter 15 minutes after he got back on the ground. (The search sector of his radar isn't an issue. He's getting paid to make it comprehensive, maneuvering as necessary, while he's up their escorting a high-value asset. The fighter plane was probably an Su-30SM using a Bars N011M series radar system, incidentally.) 
So it would take a lot of convincing for me to believe that the close encounter the night of 17 October occurred because of any inadequacy in system capability. The dangerously inadequate coordination arrangements the U.S. is tolerating are the real issue, I suspect. 
A couple of points about those arrangements. One, let's review the assessment from earlier again: 
Basically, there are two separate networks exercising command and control over the same air space – and that's your problem, right there. Add to it the likelihood that the Russians are not squawking IFF in a way that U.S. systems can interpret, and you have the potential for a nice fecal focaccia. 
This is the situation when two hostile forces are operating in the same air space. Another word for that is 'combat.' There's no political will for combat between the two forces in question, of course. But the mechanical arrangements of military operations in the battle space don't reflect that. It's an incredibly stupid situation. 
Two, the close encounter occurred at an interesting time; i.e., the second night of the ground assault on Mosul , which started on Sunday, 16 October. The U.S. had been striking targets around Mosul for about three days at that point, and had started pounding ISIS positions on the outskirts of Mosul with artillery late Saturday or early Sunday, according to local sources. Russia, at the time, was playing up a non-credible report that the U.S. planned to let thousands of ISIS fighters leave Mosul and move into Syria – implicitly to fight Syrian regime forces and thwart the intentions of the Russian coalition. (Trying to track such a stream of guerrilla evacuees, if the Russians really believed their own hype, would have been an ideal mission for the Tu-214R 'spy plane.') 
One more significant thing was happening at exactly the same time. A NATO AWACS contingent was deploying to Turkey to support the U.S. coalition in Syria and Iraq. Russia opposes that move. Although the NATO AWACS hadn't flown a mission yet, its first mission was three days later, on 20 October. The Russians knew it was there, in Turkey, setting up for operations. 
In other theaters, Russia has been signaling dissatisfaction through dangerous, unsafe military encounters for many months now. We can conclude with strong confidence that that's what has happened in Syria. We can expect it to happen again.

An increasingly common form of theft has been occurring at gas stations around the country…. 
'Most of the time, gas station customers leave their car doors unlocked and items like purses and wallets are often left in plain view,' explains the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC). 'A thief is able to drive up next to the victim's car, open an unlocked door, and grab any valuables within reach. Then, the thief quickly drives off. It happens in a matter of seconds.' 
[…] 
As the gas station surveillance camera shows in the video below, a while a customer is pumping gas with her back turned away from her car, the driver of another car pulls up and 'slides' into the passenger side door of the woman's car, grabs her purse, and then drives off — all in a matter of seconds.

A tipsy Texas collegian was taking a topless Snapchat photo for her boyfriend last night moments before she crashed her car into a cruiser, according to cops. 
Miranda Kay Rader, 19, drove her SUV into the rear of a squad car whose driver had exited the vehicle to investigate a disturbance call. Rader, seen at right, was not injured in the 8:30 PM crash in Bryan, a city bordering College Station, home to Texas A&M (where Rader is a freshman). 
When a patrolman approached Rader's Acura, he noticed that the student had on an 'unclasped brassiere' and was 'attempting to put a black blouse on.' When the officer asked why she 'was not dressed while driving,' Rader replied that she had been 'taking a Snapchat photo to send to her boyfriend while she was at the red light.' 
Rader said she was en route to her Texas A&M dormitory at the time of the crash, according to a probable cause affidavit .

Speaker Paul Ryan blasted Hillary Clinton over the Friday news that the FBI is launching a new review into her use of a private email server while secretary of State. 
In a statement released minutes after the news broke , the Wisconsin Republican reasserted his call for Clinton to be denied the classified briefings she receives because she is the Democratic presidential nominee. 
'Yet again, Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame. She was entrusted with some of our nation's most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information,' he said. 
'This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators. I renew my call for the Director of National Intelligence to suspend all classified briefings for Secretary Clinton until this matter is fully resolved.'

In a story that predictably did not make the mainstream media, and with video surveillance very difficult to find, a massive mob of black teens viciously attacked white Temple University students, police officers and even a police horse in Philadelphia on Friday night. 
[…] 
In the limited local coverage this story did receive, the race aspect was generally avoided. It is way past time to take back the media, and fill it with truth-tellers, not apologists. 
'More than 150 teens, spread out in groups of 20 or 30, descended upon the campus at around 8:30 p.m. Friday — wreaking havoc for nearly two hours before eventually dispersing,' according to NBC 10 …. 
But there is a reason for all of this horror, according to Solomon Jones of Philly.com . It evidently boils down to the progressive canard 'white privilege.' 
The black teens are feeling excluded because evil white 'others' have come into their neighborhood and built rental properties for college students, raising the property values of their neighborhoods in a way that evidently excludes the angry teens, who were used to having their blighted turf unmolested.

[Ed. – It's that bad.] 
President Obama has received higher approval ratings in his final year than he has for most of his presidency. While most voters expect Hillary Clinton to continue many of his policies if she wins, a sizable majority of her current supporters would vote for Obama instead if the rules allowed it. 
A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey shows that 70% of Likely U.S. Voters who support Clinton in the election say they'd vote for Obama if it was a legal option. Just 11% of Republican Donald Trump's voters agree. (To see survey question wording, click here .) 
Among all Likely Voters, 41% say that if Obama was legally allowed to run for a third term in office, they would vote for him over Clinton and Trump. Just over half (52%) still say they would not vote for him in that case. 
Earlier this year before the presidential nominees were decided , 31% said they would vote for Obama if he legally could seek a third term, but twice as many (62%) said they would not support him. Those findings were little changed from last year after Obama commented about winning a third term in a speech in Africa.

Republican nominee Donald Trump has claimed that the media is rigging this election against him. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
The media has made Donald Trump. Without the media, Trump would be nowhere in this election. The real rigging by the media is their shameless reporting on documents illegally leaked by the Russians to influence our election in Donald Trump's favor. 
Trump is a creation of the media. He has expertly played the media in this campaign, gaining vastly more coverage than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . He even received some 20 minutes of free coverage when the media covered a purported announcement about his claim that President Obama was not born in the United States. 
Trump spent about 30 seconds on the birther issue and the rest of the coverage amounted to about $1 million dollars' worth of free media advertising for his campaign and, incidentally, his new hotel as well. 
According to the TV News Archive, Trump has received about twice as many television mentions as Clinton: 1.1 million for Trump as compared to 571,485 for Clinton.

[Ed. – How to take the fun out of Halloween.] 
As Halloween approaches, hair-raising yard displays can often cause people to stop, gawk and whip out their cellphones. 
Larethia Haddon is well aware of that, and is using it to shine some light on real-life horrors, rather than typical Halloween themes. 
In her yard at the corner of Mendota and Santa Maria avenues in Detroit, there are six dummies portraying police shootings, slain children, the Flint water crisis, and other horrors. 
Last year, a single dummy placed face-down in the grass, realistically depicting a dead body in her yard, shocked passersby and caused fearful calls to the police. 
This time around, Haddon wants to inspire a broader range of thought, rather than just shock. 
'We're trying to do something positive instead of just having a dead body laying in the yard,' she said. 'Want to get people to be a little more focused on the issues, what's going on in the world. We need to stick together more. We need to come together. And if we don't, this scene in my yard is going to be reality every single day.'

Willmar Senior High School in Willmar, Minnesota held a mock election among their students this past Tuesday during the lunch hour. The election was part of a statewide program designed to get young people more engaged in the election-voting process. Throughout the state of Minnesota, around 282 high schools are participating in the mock election program. 
[…] 
In Tuesday's vote, around 40% of the Willmar's 1,200 students took time during their lunch hour to cast their ballots. A total of 514 ballots were cast of which 207 were for Trump and 179 for Clinton. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received 41 votes and Legal Marijuana Now party candidate Dan Vacek received 17 votes. A number of ballots had write-in names and other candidates received less than 10 votes.

Watching Hillary Clinton run from a hardball question like a roach from Raid should give every American a sense of satisfaction. When a reporter asked the former secretary of state about the Project Veritas undercover videos , which featured disgraced former Democratic operatives Scott Foval and Bob Creamer bragging about provoking violence at Trump rallies and perpetrating mass voter fraud, Clinton panicked and pulled the plug on the entire press conference. 'I know nothing about this,' said Clinton. 'I'm not — I can't deal with every one of [James O'Keefe's] conspiracy theories but I hope you all have something to eat and something to drink on the way back to New York. Thank you!' 
Conspiracy theories? Was she really trying to imply that videotaped confessions from two of her surrogates amount to a 'conspiracy theory?' Yes, she was. It's become something of a habit for her — every time Hillary wants to deny plain facts she calls them a 'conspiracy theory' — which is quite delicious coming from Ms. 'Vast Rightwing Conspiracy' herself. 
To call something a 'conspiracy theory' doesn't reveal much about its validity. Of course, some conspiracy theories are legitimately kooky. Tune in to Coast to Coast AM for a while to see what I'm talking about, or listen to Jesse Ventura expound on secret US government weather control machines in Alaska. Most of these loony conspiracy theories originate on the political Left, by the way, such as the assertion that Lee Harvey Oswald was 'sheep-dipped' to look like a communist so that JFK's real capitalist/imperialist murderers could make a clean getaway. 
But other conspiracy theories are at least plausible. Whenever two or more people plot in secret, that's a conspiracy. Anyone who suspects that a conspiracy's afoot is by definition a conspiracy theorist. If you come home from vacation to find a car parked on your lawn and the back yard strewn with red Solo cups, you might suspect that your teenaged sons conspired to throw a raging party. That's a conspiracy theory. Watergate was a conspiracy among at least the four burglars. The ensuing coverup was a conspiracy that reached all the way up to the president. Watergate has been proven to most people's satisfaction so we don't think of it as a 'theory' anymore, but there was a time, in the nascent stages of the investigation, when the whole picture was not yet known. In other words, it was a conspiracy theory — and yet it turned out to be true. 
Hillary Clinton employs the term 'conspiracy theory' because of its derisive connotation. What she means by it is that a certain accusation — in this case that her campaign has engaged in illegal election tampering — is so absurd that it would be a waste of her time to respond. It's crazy talk . File it over there with alien abductions and Illuminati shadow governments. 
Unfortunately for Hillary, the 'conspiracy theory' alleged by Project Veritas happens to be very credible. Just listen to Democratic operative Scott Foval's videotaped confession: 
We've been busing people in to deal with you f***ing assholes [Republicans] for fifty years and we're not going to stop now. We're just going to find a different way to do it. 
Foval's 'different way' is using rental cars rather than buses to get impostors from polling place to polling place on election day. That's a conspiracy theory for sure but not an unreasonable one. It's the same old shenanigans Democrats have been pulling since the heyday of Tammany Hall. Lying, cheating, and ballot box-stuffing — it's what Democrats do. Richard Daley did it in Chicago, Lyndon Johnson did it in Texas, and Hillary Clinton's doing it nationwide. 
Hillary Clinton and her media sycophants have gotten a lot of mileage out of the 'conspiracy theory' dodge this election season. When Mrs. Clinton was haunted by persistent rumors of ill health, the media countered them with accusations of conspiratorial thinking. In a column conveniently titled 'Can We Just Stop Talking About Hillary Clinton's Health Now?' the Washington Post's Chris Cillizza wrote : 
Beyond the Clinton conspiracy theorists who believe she had something to do with Vince Foster's death and that she was secretly responsible for everything from Y2K to the SpaceX explosion last week, it's hard to plausibly insist, based on the available data, that Clinton is ill. 
HuffPo contributor Melissa Jeltsen went even further, blaming both conspiratorial thinking and — you guess it! — bigotry : 'Let's get real: The wild conspiracy theories around Clinton's health are a convenient way to mask misogyny inside 'legitimate' medical concerns.' 
As it turns out, those 'conspiracy theories' weren't so 'wild' after all. Hillary Clinton later collapsed after a 9/11 memorial service but refused to go to the hospital for fear that her critics would be proven right. Thank goodness for camera phones — if the incident hadn't been recorded, Hillary would be claiming that it never happened while maligning anyone who said otherwise as a nutty conspiracy theorist — and the press would be helping her. After the incident, Clinton admitted (or 'admitted') that she was stricken with walking pneumonia, a conveniently transitory illness. If you suspect that she suffers from a more permanent medical condition you're probably a 'conspiracy theorist.' It's becoming painfully obvious that Hillary Clinton's definition of a 'conspiracy theory' is anything that contradicts her lies. 
The 'conspiracy theorist' epithet has become the media's lazy retort to every possible attack on their candidate — and make no mistake about it, she is their candidate. Earlier this month, CNN contributor Jackie Kucinich dismissed talk of Bill Clinton's sexual assaults on various women as 'conspiracy theory land,' which is frankly outrageous. Bill's accusers form a line around the block, almost as long as Bill Cosby's. We know at very least that he's a sexual harasser and, if the most serious accusations lodged against him are true, a rapist as well. He has a track record that simply cannot be denied. Oddly enough this 'conspiracy theory' would actually be a conspiracy theory if, as Kucinich implies, the accusers were lying because it would imply some shadowy group working behind the scenes to smear Bill Clinton with an endless barrage of slander. The simpler, non-conspiratorial explanation is just that Bill is a horndog off his leash. 
Jackie Kucinich is in fact a bona fide member of her own little conspiracy. In April 2015, the Clinton campaign held an 'off the record' cocktail party with friendly reporters hosted at the Manhattan home of prominent Clinton supporter Joel Benenson. Among those journalists (if you can call them that) was Jackie Kucinich. According to a hacked email: 
Much of the group consists of influential reporters, anchors, and editors. The goals of the dinner include: (1) Giving reporters their first thoughts from team HRC in advance of the announcement (2) Setting expectations for the announcement and launch period (3) Framing the HRC message and framing the race (4) Enjoying a Frida[y] night drink before working more. [Emphasis added.] 
While many reporters on the list have impotently protested that their presence at the event does not amount to media coordination with a campaign, it's hard to make the case that Kucinich is not a Clinton lackey after she spouted Clinton campaign talking points about Bill's predatory nature on national television. It takes a certain gall for Kucinich, one of Hillary Clinton's known co-conspirators, to go on television and whine about 'conspiracy theories.' 
Nearly everyone on earth harbors 'conspiracy theories' because conspiracies really do happen. Most people, however, prefer not to think of their own conspiracy theories as such because of the negative connotation associated with the term. Some conspiracy theories are downright silly but others are quite plausible. There are enough real conspiracies in the world to concentrate on the ones that are reasonably substantiated, such as Hillary Clinton's coordination with dirty tricksters Foval and Creamer. As the conspiracy theory television program The X-Files used to say, 'The Truth Is Out There.' Don't be afraid to pursue it.

Hmm, how about that? Eleven days before the game-changing 2016 presidential election, FBI Director James Comey announces that his agency is reopening the criminal investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . 
All of the expected angst and apoplexy from the Left come gushing out. An anti-Trump PAC issues a complaint against the FBI for interfering with the eletoral process . Better still, the Clinton campaign issues a statement via — of all people — its chairman, John Podesta. In it, Podesta accuses Comey of bending to presure brought by 'Donald Trump and his Republican allies' regarding the director's initial determination that no indictment against the former secretary of state should be brought. 
Podesta's prepared remarks also paraphrase Comey's declaration in July that 'no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this,' which at the time prompted much head-scratching since he also affirmed that Clinton had indeed sent and received classified information using her non-secured private email account . 
Call me a conspiracy theorist if you like — my colleague Benny Huang probably would — but I have to wonder whether all this is too convenient. Could we be witnessing a calculated plan to divert attention from the WikiLeaks emails, which have been hurting the Democratic candidate's standing in the polls? This development might even gain some sympathy for Hillary Clinton, who has long maintained the vast right-wing conspiracy — which, nota bene, includes James Comey — has it out for the Clintons. 
Or better yet, suppose that the FBI does put a rush on its investigation, as Clinton herself has now demanded, and determines for a second time that there are no grounds for an indictment. 
All the while, the press and impressionable voters would be focused on this probe. Envelope, please !

The Supreme Court said Friday it will hear a case regarding transgender students' right to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. 
The justices will hear the case sometime next year. 
At issue is whether a Virginia high school student is allowed to use the boys' bathroom. NPR's Nina Totenberg reports: 
'Gavin Grimm, a 17-year-old senior in Gloucester County … came out as transgender when he was a freshman in high school. The school principal allowed him to use the boys' bathroom, until some parents complained, and the school board adopted a policy that required students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their biological sex, or a separate single-stall restroom office.' 
So Grimm, who has been taking hormones and has grown facial hair, sued the school board. In April, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit agreed that his case could proceed. Gloucester County then petitioned the court, and in August, the justices ruled 5-3 that the school board did not have to follow the lower court's order. Justice Stephen Breyer said he voted to stay the lower court order as a 'courtesy' to maintain the status quo while the court considered whether to hear the lawsuit.

For thos who stubbornly insist that the words election and rig have never been uttered in the same sentence by wannabe president Hillary Clinton, here's a little sound bite you might have trouble making sense of.

In the clip, which appears below, Clinton can be heard plainly saying: 
I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.

As cities nationwide grapple with fatal police shootings, many involving unarmed black men, Pennsylvania's legislature on Thursday passed and sent to Gov. Wolf a bill that would block public officials from immediately releasing the names of officers involved in such incidents. 
The measure, sponsored by Republican state Rep. Martina White of Philadelphia and approved by the GOP-controlled legislature, stoked sharp opinions and drew votes largely along partisan lines. 
Supporters say the bill, supported by several local police unions, is necessary to protect police officers and their families after such incidents. 
'We are the protectors of our protectors,' said one proponent, Rep. Dominic Costa, a Pittsburgh De mocrat. 
Opponents said the bill flies in the face of transparency, which they believe is even more critical in tragic circumstances involving police shootings. 
'Do not undermine the bridges that have been built between law enforcement and communities of color,' said Rep. Margo Davidson (D., Delaware) during a floor debate. 'This legislation will do nothing but breed suspicion.'

UC Berkeley students wanted to make a point about the importance of safe spaces on campus. And what could make the campus of any university safer than converting it into a hostile environment for white students by blocking their access? 
Actually, if you read the full report at the Washington Times , you discover that the protest was never meant to include white students. Which is not to say the event wasn't inclusive, to borrow one the popular battle cries of social justice warriors. Except in this case, the only groups included were transgender and nonwhite students. 
From the Times: 
The demonstrators were caught on video [forming a human chain] blocking Berkeley's Sather Gate, holding large banners advocating the creation of physical spaces segregated by race and gender identity, including one that read 'Fight 4 Spaces of Color.' 
Protesters can be heard shouting 'Go around!' to white students who attempt to go through the blockade, while students of color are greeted with calls of 'Let him through!' 
The aforementioned video appears below and is well worth watching if for no other reason that to count the number of white faces among the protesters. To me it appears that most of them are white, and presumably self-hating. 
Who else but Berkeley progressives could find a way to demonstrate in favor of segregation on campus. Martin Luther King Jr. has to be rolling in his grave.

On Thursday, Malta withdrew permission for a Russian Navy replenishment tanker to refuel at its port. UK and American diplomats had applied pressure to the Maltese government to deny access to the tanker, as they believed the fuel would be used to replenish the Admiral Kuznetsov battlegroup. The carrier and seven accompanying vessels are believed to be headed to Syria to support the siege of Aleppo. 
Earlier this week, Spain cancelled permission for the Kuznetsov's auxiliaries to take on fuel at the North African port territory of Ceuta. The Spanish government had come under intense diplomatic pressure to deny access to the Russian vessels. 
Russian officials say that the Kuznetsov battlegroup carries enough supplies to be self-sustaining for at least 45 days, and several military spokespeople denied that they had ever asked for formal permission to call at Ceuta or Malta.

[Clinton's allies] said they were 'dumbfounded' by the revelation that the new FBI review may have been spurred by a separate investigation into Anthony Weiner sending lewd texts to a minor. Weiner is separated from wife Huma Abedin, one of Clinton's closest aides. 
And they worried that Clinton's unconventional email arrangement had finally caught up to her and might imperil her presidential bid less than two weeks before Election Day.

And they didn't and now we're all paying the price.'

You just want to watch movies and TV shows where and when you want to, so you probably think a column about utility taxes has nothing to do with how you get your entertainment. Wrong. The city of Alameda, California, has put a measure, Measure K1, before its voters that would allow Alameda to tax pay-per-view and video streaming services like Netflix and Hulu as if they were public utilities. Watsonville has a similar measure. Other California municipalities have passed similar language. They haven't begun to levy utility taxes on these platforms, but figure as soon as one city decides to levy this tax, there will be a stampede across California. … 
Michael Petricone of the Consumer Technology Association calls Measure K1 'an absurd expansion of the definition of utility.' Think of 'the precedent this sets,' he noted, if cities can tax services that don't utilize public easements or infrastructure as utilities.

[Ed. – Every now and then the facade cracks. Somebody asks a question the media haven't intervened to spin yet, and a bit of truth peeks out about what the public really thinks. CNN is our poster child on this one, but it could be any number of them.] 
Two national polls released late last week confirmed the public widely recognizes the news media's agenda in favor of Hillary Clinton and decidedly against Donald Trump, a reality documented in a NewsBusters study earlier in the week. 
'By nearly 10-1, all those surveyed say the news media, including major newspapers and TV stations, would like to see Clinton rather than Trump elected,' Susan Page and Karina Shedrofsky reported deep into a Thursday USA Today story on the latest USA Today /Suffolk University poll on the Clinton-Trump race. 
The October 27 article elaborated on how even a solid majority of Clinton supporters also realize journalists want Clinton to win: 'That includes 82% of Trump supporters and 74% of Clinton supporters. Six in 10 Trump supporters say the news media is coordinating stories with individual campaigns, rather than acting on its own accord. Three in 10 of Clinton supporters feel that way.'

Using his well-honed Barack-knows-best attitude, the president has overruled yet more federal judges, prosecutors and juries, commuting the prison sentences of 98 additional drug dealers. 
This brings to 872 the number of commutations the Democrat has granted, 688 of them this year alone, a record. More than 200 of these individuals were originally sent away for life by the nation's legal system. Many of their crimes involved firearms. 
The growing early-release figure for Obama, who has admitted his own past drug use, is already larger than the last 11 presidents combined , according to a boastful White House lawyer. And with 84 days remaining on his Oval Office lease, the Chicagoan claims he is far from done. 
Two years ago he vowed to release 10,000 felons before leaving office.

I would like to briefly sum up the message from the thought leaders of conservatism in this election cycle. 
This is their basic thesis: 
The problem with conservatism today is all these people who are wrong and stupid and horrible about everything. 
They usually don't put it so bluntly. They frame it in terms of some people being fossils, or some people being opportunistic, or some people being narrow-minded, or one-dimensional in their thinking, or one thing or another that's a tad more inventive than 'wrong, stupid, and horrible.' But not much more inventive, really, when you get right down to it. 
It's time to declare all stop, because this isn't helping anything. 
David Brooks, who tries hard to speak without brutality, has produced the latest such meditation. I don't want to pick on him. But he's written an op-ed that seems to encapsulate a lot of what's wrong with the current conservative discourse, starting with a passage like this: 
This is a sad story [about the state of conservatism]. But I confess I'm insanely optimistic about a conservative rebound. That's because of an observation the writer Yuval Levin once made: That while most of the crazy progressives are young, most of the crazy conservatives are old. Conservatism is now being led astray by its seniors, but its young people are pretty great. It's hard to find a young evangelical who likes Donald Trump. Most young conservatives are comfortable with ethnic diversity and are weary of the Fox News media-politico complex. Conservatism's best ideas are coming from youngish reformicons who have crafted an ambitious governing agenda (completely ignored by Trump). 
We could pick this apart in a number of ways, but just start with the fact that it's an exercise in contingent, situational innuendo about other conservatives. 
Older conservatives, apparently, are not 'comfortable with ethnic diversity,' and are barkingly enthusiastic about 'the Fox News media-politico complex.' My goodness, they sound awful. But what does that even mean? How do you distinguish between the implied states of being here? By what criteria? And what difference does it make, to the meaning and purposes of conservatism? 
It's as if Barack Obama appeared on the scene, and a mere eight years later, no one can remember what it was like to talk about conservatism without talking about other conserva tives as if we're all snotty gossip reporters. Heck, the folks at TMZ give their celebrity targets more mercy and benefit of the doubt. 
We can't cover everything in one post. I want to look at just one aspect of the conservative dialogue, one that isn't about the 'Trump test,' or the 'Fox News' test (who knew?), or the 'ethnic diversity' test, or the 'my Christianity is more righteous than yours' test, or any other test I see being applied out there. 
Here's the topic: the loss of moral touchstones in our culture due to the breakdown induced by cultural Marxism. 
If we want to know why conservatives can't talk to each other today, I'd suggest we start with that. 
The Berkeley test 
Many readers will have their own ideas of how to frame this with examples. I'm going to use this one . 
A mob of young people, who have been encouraged for years to believe very destructive things about their world, comes together at Berkeley. The mob's purpose: to block white students from making their way to their classes. 
Here, in the next sentence, is the result of the breakdown induced by cultural Marxism. Conservatives, for the most part, can't really think what to do about this. 
Conservatives have a good-hearted desire for a positive outcome. But this thing at Berkeley is a tough problem; it's a real problem; it's a perennial type of human problem (albeit with modern refinements) – and conservatives today are often too muddleheaded in their thinking to navigate this form of whitewater in human dynamics. 
The progressive left isn't even in this discussion, because it sees no need to defend any rights for the white students in the case. 
It's conservatives who have been stymied and silenced by the application of cultural Marxism. As little as 20 years ago, I think a lot more conservatives could have made a cogent case for what to do, based on core moral principles. Today, too many conservatives wander in a fog of doubt about those principles – and so they criticize each other instead, over irrelevancies like weariness vs. enthusiasm for Fox News. 
I propose the following as the conservative response to the event at Berkeley. Detain and identify everyone involved in blocking students' passage to class – classes those students or the taxpayer, or both, are paying good money for them to attend. Stand up, as the school administration, and inform the miscreants that this won't happen again, and if it does, they'll be expelled. Put the campus police behind this policy. Follow through as necessary to stop the tortious interference with paying customers' access to the service they are paying for. Expel students who don't obey the rules. Penalize faculty who abet them and lead them astray. 
Conservatives who think we can have a working society without such impartial enforcement need only look around them to realize that we can't. The evidence is staring us in the face, that there is no such condition as one in which we can deconstruct the rules of respect and decency through endless, unresolved, resentment-based 'dialogue,' and yet also be able to function. 
'We' can't function at all, when that so-called 'dialogue' rules us. The 'dialogue' serves to paralyze people who want good and positive things, and to leave only the people with destructive goals free to act. 
Reclaiming some core moral ideas 
There's a beating heart of society that badly needs reclaiming, and it's the function of moral authority and common expectations. Conservatives once thought systematically about that very issue, because they understood that one way or another, we are under authority. At Berkeley, students are under the de jure authority of the administration – or they are under the de facto authority of a mob. 
But on the 'de jure' side, there should be a conservative alternative to what the progressive left wants to do with authority. The left wants to use government's enforcement authority to dictate common expectations to everyone, about everything. That's the progressive left in a nutshell. 
What I outlined above, for the Berkeley situation, is a conservative concept for the use of authority to enforce some minimum common expectations, in the interest of impartiality, equality of treatment, and rightful use of services lawfully obtained. It's a decentralized concept too, with authority being wielded by the institution, and only implicitly backed by the government – but without the government being directly involved. 
That conceptual outline ought to be a recognized alternative to what is actually being done at Berkeley. But how many conservatives could really make the case for it today? How many conservatives can look at the Berkeley situation and do something besides shake their heads over how stupid everything has gotten? 
Conservatism itself is paralyzed by the nervous moral fear induced in people by cultural Marxism – which has been meant from the beginning to undermine moral confidence at the most basic level. Conservatism's problem isn't Donald Trump. Conservatism's problem is that Donald Trump isn't paralyzed by the guilt-mongering of cultural Marxism – but conservatism is . 
The answer is not for conservatism to insist that nothing move out there, until we decide what forms of paralysis will continue to suit us. The answer is that conservatives must fearlessly reclaim the necessary social concepts of authority and common expectations, and start producing results. 
The reality of 2016 
People know today that conservatives couldn't handle the situation at Berkeley the way it should be handled. Conservatives would be afraid to. People also know that progressives won't handle it properly. Progressives don't want to. 
But oddly enough, weird old Donald Trump probably would handle it the right way. He'd recognize clearly the principle of lawful access to the service you've paid for. And he wouldn't fear to enforce that principle, even though there'd be some caterwauling from the mob. 
People get that. 
Conservatives won't make headway by being angry or alarmed that Trump seems to be walking off with the 'effectiveness' rep. Sure, he probably has a lot of wrong thoughts in his head on the general topic of authority. Most people do. 
But the cost of remaining paralyzed by that concern is going up by the hour. Somebody's got to take order to this problem. The people can't afford to wait for conservatives to shake off the fear, and start acting again like what we believe in ought to be enforced. 
What do conservatives believe in? Litmus tests involving Fox News, and the excitement of an 'ambitious governing agenda'? Other equally situational, buzz-thought-sounding checklists? If so, we are in a box, right where cultural Marxism wants us. 
I submit that that, and not intransigent personalities, is our problem. There's a vacuum where our moral philosophy should be. We offer no alternative to the left's grand vision for government, and the mob's destructive rule by default. That's not because of Donald Trump. It's because we fear to engage with the reality that for human social life, there must be authority and common expectations. 
Our ears hear the wrong thing in those words. Cultural Marxism has taught us, as it has everyone else, to hear inferences like 'Hitler' and 'fascism.' 
But in fact, authority and common expectations, wielded accountably and from the right elements of society (like the family, parents, and faith, as well as the thoughtful consent of individuals), are necessary for liberty, prosperity, and hope . 
And only conservatives will think systematically about how to both limit authority, and use it beneficially. 
Don't complain about Donald Trump if your contribution to conservatism is to fuss about the other conservatives who annoy you. The conservatives who disagree with you haven't lost their way, in a static situation frozen back in 1955, because of something that's wrong with them. There is no static situation. Given that reality, they're just doing the best they can. 
Our entire civilization is in a great crisis, one that has been creeping up on us for decades. And that crisis is laying bare flaws in our conservative thinking that we have left unattended for too long. The flaws aren't about failing to accept cultural Marxism and its prejudicial tropes (like 'ethnic diversity,' used as a bell-ringer for implied guilt). The flaws are about failing to reject and defeat cultural Marxism. Its proper end is on the ash heap of history. Yet conservatives are paralyzed by being in thrall to it. We fix that, or we perish. 0 shares

Imagine if, during the Jim Crow era, a newspaper offered advertisers the option of placing ads only in copies that went to white readers. 
That's basically what Facebook is doing nowadays. 
The ubiquitous social network not only allows advertisers to target users by their interests or background, it also gives advertisers the ability to exclude specific groups it calls 'Ethnic Affinities.' Ads that exclude people based on race, gender and other sensitive factors are prohibited by federal law in housing and employment. 
[…] 
When we showed Facebook's racial exclusion options to a prominent civil rights lawyer John Relman , he gasped and said, 'This is horrifying. This is massively illegal. This is about as blatant a violation of the federal Fair Housing Act as one can find.'

According to CBS News , a Des Moines woman has been charged a woman with election misconduct, a Class D felony, after officials said she voted twice. 
Des Moines police Sgt. Paul Parizek says officers charged 55-year-old Terri Rote with first-degree election misconduct on Thursday after being notified by elections officials that she had submitted two absentee ballots. 
The real bombshell comes in paragraph 3: 
According to an Iowa Public Radio report, Rote voted two times for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. 
After quoting Trump's 'oft-repeated line on the … campaign trail: 'The polls are rigged,'' the CBS reporters note that Thursday's development is not a one-off deal. They quote Polk County Attorney John Sarcone as saying, 'This [is] maybe the third [time] we've had some irregularity that's resulted in a criminal charge.' 
From there, the writers go on to express their newfound support of voter ID laws, adding that Republicans have been right all along and some method for keeping elections honest is long overdue. 
Oh, wait a seond: No they don't. That would be the logical conclusion, but since when are liberals capable of logical thought? 1 shares

An Iranian woman has been sentenced to six years in prison after Iran's Revolutionary Guard searched her home and found a notebook that contained a fictional story she'd written about a woman who was stoned to death, according to the Eurasia Review . 
Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, 35, is the wife of political prisoner Arash Sadeghi, 36, who is serving a 19-year prison sentence for being a human rights activist, the publication reported. 
'When the intelligence unit of the Revolutionary Guards came to arrest her husband, they raided their apartment – without a warrant – and found drafts of stories that Ebrahimi Iraee had written,' the article stated. 
'One of the confiscated drafts was a story about stoning women to death for adultery – never published, never presented to anyone,' the article stated. 'The narrative followed the story of a protagonist that watched a movie about stoning of women under Islamic law for adultery.

Whispers of 'payback' are being directed at Hillary Clinton after she decried as 'unprecedented' the surprise FBI revival of its probe of her email scandal. 
That's because 24 years ago, as former President George H.W. Bush was surging back against challenger Bill Clinton, a special prosecutor raised new charges against Bush in the Iran-Contra probe, prompting Clinton to claim he was running against a 'culture of corruption.' 
Many Republicans claimed that the indictment made by special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh against former Reagan-era Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger the weekend before the 1992 election cost Bush a second term. The indictment, later thrown out, challenged Bush's claim that he did not know about a controversial arms-for-hostages deal that dogged the Reagan-Bush administration. 
When it came, Clinton seized on it, saying for example, 'Secretary Weinberger's note clearly shows that President Bush has not been telling the truth when he says he was out of the loop.' Clinton added, 'It demonstrates that President Bush knew and approved of President Reagan's secret deal to swap arms for hostages.'

Donald J. Trump has slowly but surely improved his standing in state and national polls since the final presidential debate. 
A New York Times Upshot/Siena poll released Sunday is consistent with that trend: It gives Mr. Trump a four-point lead in Florida, 46 percent to 42 percent, in a four-way race. In our first poll of Florida a month ago, Mr. Trump trailed Hillary Clinton by a percentage point. 
The survey is Mr. Trump's best recent poll in Florida, and it should be interpreted with caution. In general, it is best to look at an average of polls. Mrs. Clinton still leads in an average of recent Florida surveys by nearly three points. 
But the poll is not the only one to show Mr. Trump in the lead. A Bloomberg/Selzer poll , which is methodologically similar to the New York Times Upshot/Siena poll, showed Mr. Trump with a two-point edge last week.

For those who were hoping or dreading the continued presence of Crazy Joe Biden in a presidential administration after the Barack Obamas belatedly leave the White House, the loose-lipped 73-year-old has confirmed that the nation won't have Joe Biden to kick around any more. 
Biden, who was rumored to be on Hillary Clinton's short list for secretary of state and prior to that was being groomed as a late contender for the Democratic Party nomination in the event Clinton failed to carry California in the primary, told a Minnesota radio station Friday he has 'no intention' of serving in Hillary Clinton's administration as secretary of state or in any other role. 
'I don't want to remain in the administration.… I have no intention of staying involved,' Biden told Minnesota radio station KBJR . 
He added, though, that he wanted to 'help [Clinton] if I can in any way I can.' 
It's not clear whether Biden's lack of interest is absolute, or if he could be talked into serving as secretary of state despite his doubts. 
This report, by Blake Neff, was cross-posted by arrangement with the Daily Caller News Foundation.

A drawing of the Democratic donkey (or is that an ass?) should appear alongside the dictionary definition of the word hypocrisy . It is a rare day indeed that members of the party aren't acting in a nakedly political, self-interested manner, but the announcement last Friday that the FBI is reopening the probe into the Clinton email scandal has them in overdrive. 
Take DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile … please! She has been tweeting out a steady stream of condemnations of FBI Director James Comey ever since his letter of intent to relaunch their investigation into potential wrongdoing arrived in the hands of Congress. 
Here as an example is what she wrote yesterday: Justice officials warned FBI that Comey's decision to update Congress was not consistent with department policy https://t.co/N2yMIDnErR 
— Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) October 29, 2016 
But back in July, Brazile had only praise for Comey's wisdom and fairness. If she was lambasting anyone it was the GOP for its petulent refusal to accept the director's learned judgment: Pathetic. Simply pathetic to watch members of Congress grill Director Comey because he's not playing their game of gotcha. #Overreach 
— Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) July 7, 2016 
But when it comes to two-facedness, Brazile can't hold a candle to Team Clinton itself. In his statement on Friday, Clinton campaign honcho John Podesta wrote, 'It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election. The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining.' 
But it was not that long ago that Clinton and her enablers were singing Comey's praises. Here's Clinton campaign mouthpiece Brian Fallon: So now @realDonaldTrump is calling the former head of the FBI cyber division a liar? Pathetic. https://t.co/sXp5CCS5oL ) 
— Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) June 15, 2016 Comey was not just Deputy AG under Bush 43. He was also deputy counsel on Senate Whitewater Committee that investigated the Clintons in 90s 
— Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) July 7, 2016 Grassley now resorting to trying to bully the FBI into serving his partisan interests. Shameless. http://t.co/993cFQyDYA

It still remains to be seen what is in the emails that have prompted Comey's actions in the last 72 hours, but liberals aren't content to hold off on idle speculation . 7 shares

There's no clear consensus as of yet whether the emails were sent by Clinton herself, to Clinton, whether they were from her private server, or even whether any of the emails were new. 
Here's a breakdown of what has been reported thus far: Los Angeles Times : 'The emails were not to or from Clinton, and contained information that appeared to be more of what agents had already uncovered, the official said, but in an abundance of caution, they felt they needed to further scrutinize them.' The Washington Post : 'The correspondence included emails between Abedin and Clinton, according to a law enforcement official.' CNN : 'The emails in question were sent or received by Abedin, according to a law enforcement official.' The New York Times : 'Senior law enforcement officials said that it was unclear if any of the emails were from Mrs. Clinton's private server.' ABC News : 'These emails were not sent by Hillary Clinton, and the FBI has no evidence of wrongdoing by her, according to a source familiar with the investigation.'

A load of manure was dumped outside the Democratic Party headquarters in Warren County. 
'What reasonable person thinks this is OK????' party chair Bethe Goldenfield said in a post in the Greater Cincinnati Politics Facebook Group . 'I won't be responding to anyone who thinks this is acceptable behavior. It is ILLEGAL!' 
The same thing happened in 2012, Goldenfield noted. The suburban Cincinnati county is overwhelmingly Republican; Mitt Romney got 69 percent of the vote four years ago. It's been almost 40 years since a Democrat was elected to countywide office. 
Goldenfield told The Enquirer the Warren County Sheriff's Office called her around 7:45 a.m. Saturday alerting her to the manure pile outside the Lebanon building. Deputies met party officials later to review video.

'Let's put this in context,' Spicer told Smerconish. 'Hillary Clinton initially said she turned over everything that was relevant. The only thing she didn't were emails regarding yoga and Chelsea's wedding.' 
'We know that to be false.' 
'Further, when Huma Abedin left the State Department they have to file a form of OF-109,' he continued. 'It's a separation agreement that states simply people understand when leaving government that they are maintaining no classified information, they understand their legal obligation to protect further classified information and safeguard any potential disclosures of that.'

1. If Clinton is indicted before the election 
The FBI merely said that they are reopening their investigation to examine new emails that came to light. They have yet to even determine whether the emails are actually evidence of criminal activity, let alone decide whether or not to prosecute. Therefore, it's highly unlikely that an indictment would come before November 8. If it did, the indictment itself wouldn't mean that Clinton could no longer run, as an indictment is only an accusation, not a conviction…. 
2. If Clinton steps down before the election 
Should Clinton relinquish her candidacy before the election, the Democratic National Committee has rules in place for what happens next. Article 2, Section 7 of the DNC Bylaws says that if there is a vacancy on the national ticket, a special meeting of the Committee 'shall be held on the call of the Chairperson,' where they would choose a new candidate. Such meetings make decisions based on a majority of those in attendance. Since we are exactly 11 days away from the election, there is one major problem: The ballot deadlines have passed in nearly every state.

As Marco Rubio and Patrick Murphy squared off in the final debate of their Florida Senate race, the discussion turned to the Syrian civil war. Rubio, a former presidential candidate and member of the Senate intelligence committee, challenged his rival's understanding of the factions on the ground. Murphy, a two-term congressman, reverted to a familiar line. 
'It just goes back to the same point,' he said, 'that Senator Rubio continues to support Donald Trump, and it is shameful that he stands there with him.' 
The audience laughed, faintly, at one of nearly 20 mentions of the Republican presidential nominee during the one-hour debate. When Murphy next mentioned Trump, Rubio was quick with a rejoinder based on a famous Joe Biden rebuke of Rudy Giuliani : 'A noun, a verb and Donald Trump: that's his answer to everything.' 
The race in Florida, among the most closely watched in the country, could help determine whether Republicans keep control of the Senate.

Jamie Otis [the man who destroyed Donald Trump's Walk of Fame Star] is now in police custody and waiting to be formally booked at the Men's Central jail in downtown L.A. The suspect in the early Wednesday morning destruction of Donald Trump 's Hollywood Walk of Fame star was arrested by the LAPD at his home sometime around 7 AM today, sources confirm. 
Otis had planned to hold a press conference at 9:30 AM this morning on Hollywood Blvd at the location of the already being repaired Trump star . Accompanied by his lawyer, Otis was then going to head over to the Hollywood Police station and turned himself in, he told Deadline last night. 
With damages of over $400, the felony vandalism charge could see Otis in jail for up to 3-years and paying out fines of over $10,000 if found guilty. LAPD and the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce estimated on Wednesday that the damage Otis' sledgehammer and pick-ax did to the now Presidential candidate's nearly decade old star was around $2,500.
