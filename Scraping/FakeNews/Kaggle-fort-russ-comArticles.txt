Russia's permanent representative to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, is sure that the bloodshed in South-East Ukraine could be avoided if the country's authorities apologized to the population of the DPR and LPR like Verkhovna Rada deputy Nadezhda Savchenko proposed. 
The Russian diplomat said this in commenting on the statement of the Verhkovna Rada's vice speaker, Irina Gerashchenko, made at a meeting of the UN Security council in which the Kiev representative once again accused Russia of aggression against Ukraine. In addition, the Ukrainian politician called Savchenko 'the most famous prisoner of the Kremlin freed in exchange for military personnel from the Russian Army.' 
'In her speech, Ukraine's representative mentioned Nadezhda Savchenko. After being pardoned, she returned to her homeland where she stated that Kiev should apologize to the residents of Donetsk and Lugansk. It is a pity that Ukrainian authorities don't have enough humanity or political courage to do so,' Churkin said. 
According to Churkin, the inter-Ukrainian crisis would have been resolved long ago if Kiev didn't attempt time and time again to change the Minsk Agreements. He stressed: 'There would have been no conflict in Donbass if Kiev had not opted for armed suppression of the dissent that arose after a coup backed by foreign forces was carried out in the country.'  

Russia's UN representative added that for two years already 'Ukrainian security forces have shelled residential areas of Donetsk and Lugansk, as a result of which civilians, including women and children, have been killed.' He referred to the UN High Commissioner for Human Right's report on abductions and torture to which Ukrainian forces have subjected women.

Last week, an event occurred capable of revolutionizing not only Ukraine, but all of Eastern and part of Central Europe. On October 20th, the Ukrainian parliament adopted the Declaration of Memory and Solidarity of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland and Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. This document condemned the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and modern Russian policy and remarked that 'the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact concluded by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany led to the Second World War.' 
Let's set aside pseudo-scholarly interpretations of what is officially called the Nazi-Soviet Nonaggression Pact but is more famously known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. This agreement was preceded by Western countries' (England and France's) unprecedented concessions to German Chancellor Adolf Hitler. These included the betrayal of Czechoslovakia by the Munich Agreement (which British Prime Minister Chamberlain praised as 'peace for our time') followed by the invasion of the country in late September 1938 by the troops of Hitler's Germany, Poland, and Hungary. Stalin's USSR (of which I am no supporter) consistently sought to create a common European system of defense against Hitler's Germany in contrast to the USSR of Lenin and Trotsky which in the early 1920's sought to bring revolutionary war to Europe. But England, the chief architect of interwar Europe, deliberately pushed Hitler to the East for the Third Reich and Soviet Union to collide.  
As early as 1934, the foreign policy leaders of the Second Polish Republic had concluded a nonaggression pact with Germany 5 years before the analogous agreement concluded by the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, but refused to sign a nonaggression pact with the USSR. Poland paid for its anti-Soviet (in fact anti-Russian) policies and complicity in the occupation of Czechoslovakia with the loss of its independence and enormous human losses. England paid for such with a one-on-one war with Hitler's Germany that lasted a whole year, during which only the insular island position of the English saved them from German occupation. Soviet Russia paid for this with the bloodiest war in its history, from which it emerged as the victor and liberator of all of Europe. The leaders of today's Europe are not inclined to gratitude towards Russia for its historic mission and the millions of Russians who laid down their lives on the altar of European freedom. 
Ukraine, a state which can count only a quarter century of existence, has no historical tradition, historical memory, nor strategic thinking. Thus, its current establishment is incapable of even thinking about the immediate consequences of its resolution on the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. And these consequences will be very bitter for Ukraine. 
Today's Poland is already talking about restitution, i.e., the return of Poles' property in the Kresy, i.e., the eastern lands which belonged to Poland before the Second World War and amount to 5 regions of modern Ukraine (Galicia and Volyn) and Western Belarus and Lithuania. By condemning the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Ukraine is automatically condemning its sovereignty over 5 western regions therin recognized as illegally seized from Poland.  
Not so long ago, Verkhovna Rada Speaker Parubiy called for a visa regime to be introduced with Russia, thereby depriving 5 million Ukrainian 'guest workers' of bread and solid earnings. The consequences of the Rada's resolution on October 20th go even further by questioning the territorial borders of contemporary Ukraine, of which President Putin once said half belong to Russia and half to Eastern Europe. 
The condemnation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact done to curry favor with the Poles is not Ukraine shooting itself in the foot, but shooting itself in the head to spite its Russian neighbor.  
Poles will undoubtedly take advantage of Ukrainians' fantastic foolishness and will one day demand that their lands be returned, in particular Lvov, their 'Cemetery of Eaglets' that is so sacred to Poles' historical memory. They will also demand their territorial share of Czech Republic, the lands of Transcarpathian Rus that they lost in 1945 and are now Ukraine's, Romanian Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina which were annexed in 1940 and transferred to Soviet Ukraine, and Hungary's part of Transcarpathia, now also part of Ukraine. All of these lands were acquired by Ukraine thanks to Stalin's Commissar of Foreign Affairs, Vyacheslav Molotov, who has now been condemned by the Verkhovna Rada as the initiator of the Second World War.  
Ukraine's state actors, being so devoid of any historical and state experience and tradition, do not bother to look so 'far' (beyond their own noses) into the future. The issue of territorial claims being raised against Ukraine by its current allies in the West is only a matter of time. As long as the West needs Ukraine as a springboard for war against Russia, Ukraine's sovereignty over its western territories criminally acquired thanks to Stalin and Molotov will not be challenged. But as soon as the situation changes, the West will suddenly 'remember' the territory of Soviet Ukraine, which today's successor state of Ukraine has called 'the totalitarian USSR', and demand that its historical debts be paid off. 

This will concern not only Ukrainians, but also Belarusians, Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, Romanians, and Russians. The Ukrainians have launched a domino effect whose consequences will be felt across all of Europe.

Russian air force planes are carrying out massive strikes against ISIS in tandem with the Syrian Army's offensive in Aleppo, eliminating militants and their commanders.  
Russian Spring has been informed of the details of the military operation by a military source. 
Over the past day, as a result of precision air strikes by Russian air forces on ISIS and Jebat Al-Nusra terrorists' positions in Aleppo, Idlib, Hama, and Homs, militants' human losses have amounted to 200 killed and more than 250 wounded, along with 32 heavy-machine-gun-mounted pick ups and 20 units of other automotive vehicles destroyed. 
As a result of yesterday's offensive by Syrian government troops on Jebat Al-Nusra positions in Aleppo's northeastern districts, the radicals have suffered significant losses. In the Bustan al-Basha district, the main sapper responsible for preparing 'jihad-mobiles', Muhammad Al-Fatah, was killed. 
In the Khandrat district, ten militants were liquidated. Among 20 additionally wounded was Field Commander Mustafa Halasi. 
In the Sheikh Fares district, a control point along with Field Commander Muhammad Abu Al-Hon and 15 associates were liquidated.

During a press conference in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, official spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told journalists that Ukraine is purposefully disinforming the public on the question of providing weapons to OSCE observers in Donbass. 
'Kiev's statement that some kind of agreement on deploying an OSCE police mission in Donbass has been achieved does not match reality. The mission will have a purely civil character,' Zakharova explained. 
According to her, Russia supported the possibility of providing observers with  service weapons  during discussions , but the issue did not go forward due to a lack of consensus. 

Zakharova added that the deployment of a police mission is possible only on the contact line.

October 29, 2016 - Ruslan Ostashko, PolitRussia - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


Every speech of the Russian president at international forums is a landmark event. I say so not because I am a Russian journalist and support the president, but because Vladimir Putin is on the very short list of global politicians who can speak inconvenient and politically incorrect truths from the podium even if someone is shocked or hurt. 
For example, Barack Obama's speeches can be listened to learn a new flat joke about the Russian economy, which he tore to shreds. But Putin, Trump, and Xi Jinping's speeches are worth listening to for the sake of those moments when they tear off the veils of unnecessary political correctness and call things by their names. Who else among world leaders, and not marginal oppositionists, can tell us about supranational oligarchical and bureaucratic elites?  
Of course, as Putin himself said, he cannot allow himself to make sharp epithets, but for anyone who speaks Russian, it is not difficult to understand who he had in mind and what he thinks about them. I often doubt the psychological health of the American political elite, but Putin prefers to say that Western elites are 'acting irrationally' and 'stepping on the same rake.' One can only envy the restraint of our president. 
Putin used his speech at Valdai to pointedly and very wittily respond to the claims that the collective West has made against Russia lately. 
I especially liked the rhetorical 'fork' with which he poked the Americans accusing Russia of meddling in the American elections. Putin said that this is impossible since the US is a great power, not a banana republic, and thereby humiliated his opponents. If they will continue to insist that Russia is interfering, then they will humiliate the US by admitting that the US is now at the level of a banana republic. If Putin is to be agreed with on the greatness of the US, then it turns out that all the accusations of Russian intervention look silly. 
Putin also expressed a thesis which will be used by all anti-systemic European politicians. He said that the European Parliament now has more influence on the lives of ordinary Europeans and controls more spheres of life than the Supreme Soviet in the USSR. Putin stressed that Brexit was a surprise for the European elite, systemic media, and politicians who suddenly discovered that a significant part of society is discontent with the current situation in which ordinary citizens have no say.  
In this spirit, he explained the popularity of Donald Trump, who has become the spokesman of the desires of ordinary Americans who are tired of irresponsible politicians and elites. 
Overall, Putin painted with broad strokes for the audience a revolutionary situation, one in which 'those at the top can't go on and those at the bottom don't want to' [a reference to Lenin's famous description of a "revolutionary situation" in his  Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder - JA]. 
In this case, the top is the supranational oligarchy and bureaucracy mentioned by Putin which, feeling dizzy with success after victory in the Cold War, made mistakes, and is now faced with a situation in which it has to acknowledge that globalization and multiculturalism are not working.  
The bottom is the world's citizens, including those of the West and those political leaders who are called 'marginal' by systemic elites. Putin even formulated a mini-program that the peoples of Russia, China, and France can all get behind. Putin said that the ordinary inhabitants of the planet want to be ensured preservation of cultural identity, freedom, and independence. 
The problem is that the existing supranational bureaucracy and oligarchy can't give them this. After all, the preservation of cultural identity means the end of globalization and independence means the end of the hegemony of one civilizational project. Freedom is like an acid eating away at formal and informal structures dictating countries how to live, what currency to use, what history to remember, and who to call terrorists and who freedom fighters.  
I am very pleased that Russia has strong media working towards Western audiences, and I am sure that many ordinary Westerners will recognize themselves in this description of frustrated and angry citizens who no longer want to live the old way and want to smash the existing system. It is as if Putin is holding out his hand to them and assuring them that we are the same, that we have one big, serious, and common problem: the very same supranational oligarchy and bureaucracy which is pulling the strings of some American and European leaders. Psychologists say that the joint resolution of complex problems is the best way to tie a long and enduring friendship.  

We can't be friends with today's Western elites. Putin is not going to retire, and in the future disgruntled citizens will be able to change the Western elites.

At yesterday's session of the international Valdai Discussion Club, Vladimir Putin made a number of statements about the system of international relations. He reminded listeners that American hegemony has already left a long trail of military invasions of sovereign countries - Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, etc. This was followed by the reminder that Russia 'opened up' in the mid-1990's and hoped for equal dialogue, but did not receive the expected.  
By this Putin had in mind the (naive) trust in Western countries during the decade of Yeltsin's rule that was unprecedented in Russian history. The United States responded to Russia's openness with attempts to maximally weaken Russia from within (including by means of 'reforms' and privatizations carried out with the participation of American specialists) and from without, such as by creating a chained perimeter of border countries controlled by Washington around Russia's borders. Russia was forbidden from having its own interests beyond its borders while US' interests stretched up to Russia's borders and even inside the country.  
President Putin also could have added that he himself, at the beginning of his presidency, pursued policies maximally open towards the West. After all, it was he who first lent a hand to the American people after the terrorist attack on September 11th, 2001 by clearly condemning this act of terrorism and allowing America to establish air bases in Central Asia. Patriotic experts harshly condemned Putin for this. The Russian president also closed the country's last military bases and intelligence stations in Cuba and Vietnam. After the closure of Russia's last military bases abroad, NATO expanded its borders East and accepted the former Warsaw Pact countries and union republics (the Baltic states) into its ranks. If not for Russia's tough diplomatic resistance, Georgia and Ukraine also could have been added to the list of NATO member countries. 
This was a huge mistake on Moscow's part, but the president gained invaluable experience and is now no longer inclined to trust the pseudo-democratic demagogy of Washington, now constantly calling on Eastern European countries (Poland and the Baltics) to defend against the mythical Russian threat. 
In fairness, let us note that many serious observers in the West have spoken against the disastrous policy of pushing Russia into a corner. Very bold predictions were made (which seemed fantastical 16-20 years ago) that Russia would revive its military might and restore the country to the status of a great world power.  
The semi-marginal, 'light-heavyweight' American politician Patrick Buchanan, for example, called for relying on Russia's remaining strength rather than constantly annoying it. Today, his views do not appear to be marginal even though, as far as we can see, they remain the ideology of the minority. On the other hand, in Russia there is the marginal liberal minority whose ideology is that of unilateral concessions to the West. Putin's popularity lies in that he is supported in foreign policy issues and issues of national security even by opposing trends, from communists to nationalists.  
In his Valdai speech, President Putin demonstrated a realistic understanding of the external and internal challenges and threats facing Russia. Russia has a number of domestic problems ranging from economic and social to demographic ones, but the US has no less such problems.  
Hence why Russia is not going to pursue and is not pursuing an expansionist policy. Not only because this contradicts its principles, but also because it is contrary to Russia's national interests. In NATO itself there are those who don't believe that Russia actually has plans to conquer the Baltic states or Poland. Pushing this line is, perhaps, in the interests of these countries (or rather, their comprador establishments), but not Russia's.  
What Russia is interested in is searching for allies in Europe and even the US itself, mainly those outside of the these countries' political classes that are so tightly controlled by Washington. 
As shown by the legislation on "plutonium disarmament" and Putin's speech yesterday, Russia is already tired of giving unilateral concessions and sacrificing its own interests without getting even moral compensation. Thus, Vladimir Putin's strategy in recent years and even months can be called a transition to active defense. 
Russia is outlining the (not too extensive) circle of its interests outside its borders and concentrating on its internal problems. As the foreign minister of the Russian Empire, Prince Gorchakov, said after Russia's defeat in the Crimean War and the signing of the humiliating Treaty of Paris in 1856, 'Russia is concentrating.' After a long 20 years, Russia has come to pursue a policy of active defense, carefully avoiding occasions for war.  

Russia has not suffered any defeats in 2016, but it still faces the same problems, such as concentrating on resolving internal tasks. But Russia does not intend to surrender its positions, whether inside our outside the country. This idea was the main message of Vladimir Putin's speech on October 27th.

None of which is happening in the world today is an accident. It is a planned and implemented strategy. Putin refers to these as "mistakes of the West" - but this is diplomatic-speak. They are not mistakes, but deliberate and (poorly) strategised policy initiatives designed to destroy or economically enslave.

For the first time since the Cold War, the 'Russian question' has become an important part of the debates between US presidential candidates. In turn, Russia is highly interested in a favorable outcome of the elections in the United States. In Russia itself, discussion has long been raging over which one of the US presidential candidates is better for Russia's interests: Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?  
Russian society's sympathy undoubtedly belongs to Donald Trump, as Clinton has a high disapproval rating given her personal qualities and approach to Russia. If she is elected president of the United States, then she will likely become the most unpopular head of the White House in Russian public opinion. 
The 'Russian question' is part of a more global question of the new world system in which the US is losing its status as the world's sole superpower. Russia is playing an important role in changing the American Empire's status, perhaps even a leading one. But the American crisis is even more comprehensive and goes far beyond Russia's influence. A Russia dreaming of returning its former imperial greatness is less to blame for the fall of the US' imperial influence than the irrationality of the American elites themselves.  
Russia survived two collapses in the 20th century consequential of internal factors.  The two Russian revolutions of the 20th century (1917 and 1991) were the result of a low quality of the ruling class and the undermining of their authority in society. The external factor was important, but still only a subsidiary cause of the collapse of the government and society. I believe that America is facing a similar crisis.  
As the author of these lines was told 10 years ago by an astute and recognized scholar, a former citizen of the USSR who emigrated to the US in the early 1990's, America is today undergoing the same wrenching transformations that the Soviet Union experienced in the Perestroika period. This scholar's view of the future of his new homeland was exclusively pessimistic - he believed that the US would not cope with its own restructuring primarily because of the unsuitability of its own elites. 
Of course, my opinion as a person who knows little of America and the opinion of the more knowledgeable above-mention citizen are only personal ones. But the emergence of the phenomenon of Donald Trump is not a detail, but an objective consequences of the deep crisis of the American system.  
The Trump phenomenon demonstrates at least two critical factors: (1) the complete alienation of the American elites (or as the Czech communist ideologist Dr. Skala says, the American 'nomenklatura') from the people, and (2) the American nomenklatura's complete loss of touch with reality. Both are painfully reminiscent of the situation in the USSR before Perestroika.  
The late Soviet elites (the 'nomenklatura,' as they were pejoratively called in society) turned into a closed caste. Even though, in my opinion, they were still more democratic than the current American elite, the Soviet nomenklatura sacrificed the interests of real modernization of the country's social-economic system and ideology for the sake of pursuing geopolitical phantoms. Perhaps I am wrong, but such "false idols" prevail in the minds of the current American nomenklatura even more.  
In the US, factories are closing, migration is growing, Mexico is slowly realizing a Reconquista (the return of their lands in the southwestern states of the US that were annexed as a result of an unjust war), and all of this is happening against the backdrop of imperial overstretch. The US is striving to control not only its backyard, Latin America (which is being actively penetrated by Chinese capital, another manifestation of the phantom thinking of the American nomenklatura), but also Ukraine, for which Russia is ready to fight to the last breath.  
America does not have the strength for this. But the American nomenklatura does not have the slightest interest in taking care of things at home and concentrating on domestic issues. Continuing American expansion is akin to Trotsky's permanent revolution. Such is intriguing and vivid, while home repairs and cleaning toilets is infinitely boring and tedious. 
This is why the US presidential elections will be won by the political lunatic and American Trotskyist, Hillary Clinton, who does not strive for realism or call for cleaning the Augean stables like Donald Trump does. 

Obviously, for Russia it is better to deal with a US government which defends its own national interests, not phantoms of pseudo-democracy and its declining imperial power. But little depends on Russia's opinion. Therefore, it is advisable to prepare for and objectively observe the course of the fight whose outcome is practically a foregone conclusion.

While the European Parliament makes preparations about exempting Ukrainian citizens from the visa obligation, the figures are speaking volumes about the prospects of this measure: more than half of Ukrainians are ready to leave their country.  
About 30% of Ukrainians would want to flee the country, according to a recent survey conducted by the "Raiting" group. An even greater number of respondents, 40%, would wish to work abroad, citing the difficulty of "a decent life" in Ukraine.  

While in the immediate aftermath of the Maidan, 58% of Ukrainians were against the idea of leaving the country, but three years later, only 28% completely reject the idea. 

Explaining their choice, the respondents put forward their hopes of having better living conditions and ensuring a happy future for their children. Notable also is the fact that the majority of potential migrants live in the western and central regions of Ukraine, ie those closest to the border with the EU. In 2015, about 9.5 million Ukrainian migrants crossed the Polish border.  

Is the EU about to withstand a new wave of migration? 

No need to wait long for the answer. The new statistics are a reminder of the promise made just yesterday by Piotr Poroshenko. The visa-free regime between Ukraine and the EU will be in place by November 24, he said yesterday, adding that Kiev had fulfilled all its commitments to Brussels.  

The obligations to stop the war in the southwest and improve living standards in the country apparently were not part of the list.

Once again, the Ukrainian electorate is being taken for a grand ride and being stirred up. Whether unfortunately or fortunately, our information field overlaps with the raging infofield of our neighbors, and we have the opportunity to observe in real time the nervous breakdown of particularly impressionable citizens in neighboring Ukraine.  
Some Russian connoisseurs take pleasure in this spectacle, and this are understandable. The point is that Western advisors have forced Ukrainian politicians and officials to declare their income and assets and open up testaments of this information for public access. Due to the primitiveness of the Ukrainian political class, which loves to steal a lot openly and is also full of confidence that nothing will happen, the contents of their declarations of assets was simply extravagant. 
Speaking plainly, reading the declarations of the leaders of the Maidan leaves its supporters in depression or rage. Some people particularly sensitive in nature are going mad and falling into depression at the same time. They can also be understood. It's not pleasant for anyone to feel like a sucker and loser who has been let down in the most primitive way. 
In this sense, Poroshenko's declaration of assets is not so impressive, since his wealth is already widely known. Some Ukrainians are even proud that Poroshenko is richer than Putin and many American presidents. But the declarations of ordinary members of the Ukrainian political class are shocking. 
For example, Verkhovna Rada deputy Demchak, the deputy chairman of the committee regulating banking operations, revealed a bank account with 2,000 UAH and 133 million UAH in cash. Besides obvious questions as to the origins of this wealth, there's also the high trust which only a politician responsible for Ukrainian banks could have in the Ukrainian banking system.  
133 million UAH in cash looks very patriotic because the rest of Ukrainian politicians also prefer cash, but dollars or euros, not gryvnia. 
The declaration of Gontareva, the head of the National Bank of Ukraine, revealed $1.8 million and only 62,000 UAH. I think that all questions about the prospects of the Ukrainian currency's course can be left aside, as the question as to how Gontareva has this money is what will continue to excite inquisitive Ukrainian citizens.  
In general, Ukrainian officials' declarations are reminiscent of fragments from the works of Ilf and Petrov about petty schemers who seized too much power. Formerly poor politicians suddenly find a collection of antique paintings, tons of cash money, antique books, jewelry, and large plots of land and shares in commercial companies.  
The reactions to all of this on social networks are also fascinating. For example, social network users write that the declarations 'destroyed faith in the country' or dismayed them for having been sent to the ATO for 'the last 5 gryvnia' while deputies were earning millions. Other users expect a 'short and merciless revolt' which, this time, is supposed to bring genuinely honest professionals to power. 
Politicians and their paid trolls are calling disgruntled citizens 'pinheads' and demanding that they rejoice that they've been allowed to see how the successful and hard-working leaders of the Maidan live, who have by leaps and bounds been leading Ukraine towards its bright European future. 
I am especially touched by those who sincerely believe that the asset declarations are a kind of silver bullet with which the Americans are killing Ukrainian corruption. This is nonsense. As a kind of humanitarian assistance to the fraternal Ukrainian people, I'll tell you why this happened and how it will end. 
Let's start with the most simple. No Maidan was needed to force deputies and officials to submit declarations. Seriously, not at all. In Russia, officials have long had to submit declarations and they are meticulously studied by relevant authorities and opposition activists. This is the first point. 
Secondly, the Americans are forcing Ukrainian officials to submit declarations not because they care about ordinary Ukrainians, but because they are trying to improve the culture of the colonial administration, i.e., take out of the picture those politicians who are too stupid to organize theft even by South American standards. Roughly speaking, the declarations made it clear why Poroshenko is president. At least he knows how to use offshore companies and doesn't stuff bags with cash. 
Thirdly, those who think that the system of declaring assets is a guarantee that there will be no more corruption are very naive people. Similar systems exist in South America, Europe, Asia, and even Moldova. This system keeps complete idiots out of government, but makes little difference overall. 
Fourthly, the only real benefit of this system is that those who are now offended over having received only 5 gryvnia can guess that these millions of euros and dollars in cash didn't fall to deputies from the sky, but came from giving others only 5 gryvnia. Unfortunately, people haven't realized this yet. Those who are outraged on social networks can't even use logic to remember that the 'vatniks' and 'colorados'  of Donbass warned them about this before. 
Fifthly, there will be no revolt. No one was smart enough to set aside money for this, and color revolutions don't happen without money. Ukrainian politicians will continue to plunder their fellow citizens who, after the recent scandals, now believe that the fight against corruption is going at full speed'¦ 

Finally, judging by media reports, the Netherlands still haven't ratified the association agreement with Ukraine. There is the chance that studying the lists of Ukrainian politicians' assets will distract Ukrainians from such sad thoughts. They will continue to believe that the Maidan was for the association agreement with the EU, not for the sake of Gontareva or Poroshenko's millions. This means that they still have a lot of surprises awaiting them. As long as they do not admit that they made a foolish mistake, the situation will not change for the better.

An inspection team from Canada, Denmark, and the Netherlands met with the command of the 93rd Kharkov mechanized guard brigade of the Ukrainian armed forces. The official website of the General Staff of the UAF has reported this. 
The announcement says that the visit by European inspectors was intended to study the real situation on the demarcation line in Donbass. 

'Military personnel from Canada, Denmark, and the Netherlands visited a training ground for fire and tactical training, where they praised the level of Ukrainian troops' weapon mastery and happily fired at targets with rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles, automatic grenade launches, and anti-tank grenade launchers,' the report reads.

Hardly a day goes by without foreign media circulating the false accusations that the leadership of the Syrian Arab Republic is guilty of the deaths of hundreds of thousands and even millions of Syrians. Even authoritative international organizations are cited as the sources of the dissemination of such information. 
In July 2013, according to UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, the death toll in Syria exceeded 100 thousand.  
In October 2014, the Jordanian prince and UN high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, determined the number of people killed in Syria to be 200,000.  
By October 2015, according to UN figures, the number of killed in Syria was more than 240,000. 
In September 2016, the UN officially presented the figure of 300,000 Syrians killed and more than half of the Syrian population as refugees. 
According to the Dubai news channel 'Al-Arabiya,' in October 2015, the number of killed had already surpassed 250,000. The New York Times produced similar figures. 
After the beginning of the Russian air force's operation in Syria, the figures of casualties presented by Western sources did not change for the better. Of course, the countries participating in the conflict 'correct' the data in favor of their interests and many media outlets operate with unverified information from the Supervisory Board on Human Rights of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights created by the opposition. 
How objective are these disseminated figures?  
The Russian Institute of Oriental Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences has conducted its own study using data from the Central Statistical Bureau of Syria. This was reported at a press conference entitled 'Syria: The Thorny Path to Reconciliation' at the Russia Today media agency by the UN's senior advisor and representative on Syria, Russian Academy of Science correspondent Vitaliy Naumkin.  
In 2011, the population of Syria amounted to 22.51 million people. According to the figures of the Syrian Central Statistical Bureau, the Syrian Arab Republic's population has declined to 17.87 million.  
Given the average growth rate of the population excluding refugees, the total number for today was supposed to be 24.64 million people. As of October 20th, 2016, the number of Syrian citizens (including emigrants) is 24.54 million.  
Given correct calculations, the number of Syrians killed over five years of war has been determined, taking into consideration that around 7 million people have left Syria as refugees. 
According to the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the total number of Syrians killed is 105,000. The losses of the government army and militia amount to 45,000. 24,000 militants of terrorist organizations from among the local population have been killed, and 35,000 civilians have been killed. The largest number of civilians have been killed at the hands of jihadists and the so-called 'moderate opposition.' Around 18,000 in Syria have been killed by foreign mercenaries of terrorist groups including citizens from 80 countries.  
Earlier, the ex-head of the Israeli secret services Nativ, Yaakov Kedmi, presented almost identical figures of Syrian losses (around 40,000 civilians). 
American assessments, as a rule, range from several hundred thousand to millions killed, which is beyond the boundaries of reality. 
But the point is not even in the statistics. The death of people in principle should not become an object of political speculation or an instrument of information war. American lies on the number of people killed in Syria is doubly disgusting because it is the US that developed and attempted to realize regime-change projects against unfavorable leaders in a number of Middle Eastern and African 'rouge states' by means of terrorists from 'moderate oppositions' and fomenting civil wars... 
The American coalition does not want to publicize the civilian losses resultant of their air strikes on ISIS in Iraq. And yet the coalition has repeatedly hurled accusations against others for losses among the civilian population. During the Iraq War (2003-2011), 460,000 Iraqis were killed. The assault on Mosul is also resulting in many victims among the civilian population. 
Palestinian political analyst Azzam Abu Saud remarked in the Norwegian newspaper Dagsavisen:  'The US has made a mass of mistakes in Syria. The war in Syria never would have been so bloody if the US had not supplied weapons to rebels. The US, in addition, created the Islamic State, which has now spun out of their control.' 
Another Norwegian publication, ABC Nyheter , adds: 'The US claims that only 55 civilians and 45,000 militants from ISIS and other militant Islamists have been killed as a result of more than 11,000 coalition airstrikes on ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria since 2014'¦Even when the American leadership is presented with the lists of civilians killed in Syria and Iraq and their photographs, they refuse to acknowledge their deaths.'  

The Russian approach to resolving the Syrian and other Middle Eastern conflicts remains the same: there is no military solution. Success is possible only through dialogue and national reconciliation.

On October 28th, the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAN) selected its foreign members. This tradition dates back centuries and is of a more symbolic nature. In addition to bearing the honorary title, foreign members can participate in the life of RAN and even vote at the academy's general meetings, even though they have no decisive vote.  
This year, the ranks of RAN's foreign members expanded to include seven Nobel laureates, among them the well known diplomat and former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger'¦ 
As reported by Boris Chetvertyushkin who announced the results of academicians' voting, the procedure implies that scholars, including Kissinger, are informed of their nomination and give their consent. The Russian Academy of Science's foreign members are chosen from among the greatest foreign scholars recognized by the scientific community. If it is clear why some were chosen for physics and chemistry, then Kissinger received the offer for his geopolitical studies. 
The historical role of Kissinger is still debated to this day, including in the US. He is usually respected for his agreement to end the war in Vietnam and the Cold War detente between the United States and USSR. Interestingly enough, the leader of the North Vietnamese Communists, Le Duc Tho, received the Nobel Prize together with Kissinger for the success of the Paris Agreement, but refused to accept the award.  
Then Kissinger overthrew the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia which, ironically, he had brought to power insofar as he was the initiator of secret missions in Cambodia which dropped 110,000 tons of bombs on the country and plunged it into bloody chaos and genocide. And the concept of the 'honorable peace' which preceded the conclusion of the ceasefire in Vietnam and cost the lives of millions of Vietnamese and tens of thousands of Americans, not to mention wounded, injured and missing, is also one of Kissinger's achievements. 
His other striking 'achievement' was the fascist coup in Chile through which Augusto Pinochet came to power and submerged the country in mass purges and arrests. Only one month after the coup, 30,000 people had been killed.  
Kissinger also achieved rapprochement between the US and China against the USSR, which in the US is to this day considered to be one of his greatest successes. He has been called the modern Machiavelli and the architect of the new world order. 
Kissinger cannot but be admired as a worthy opponent. All the agreements, operations, and projects worked out by him, regardless of their cruelty and consequences, worked out brilliantly. This is why Kissinger's services have always been used by all the powers in this world worth at least something. For decades, Kissinger has been a trustee of the Rockefeller clan. 
The 93-year-old diplomat came to Russia in 2016 to meet with Vladimir Putin and once again participate in the settlement of the new Cold War. Following their meeting, Kissinger wrote an article in which he expressed concern for the fate of the world. In his opinion, US-Russian relations are now worse than they were during his time as Secretary of State. He urged the two superpowers to work together, because this is the only way to maintain the otherwise shaky world balance. 
Kissinger is an old school diplomat symbolizing the peak of the US' greatness. Today, he is a beneficial icon contrasted to the Obamas and Clintons who build their policies on the eternal dichotomy between imaginary US democracy and the imaginary totalitarianism of the US' opponents. Instead of ideology, Kissinger speaks of pragmatic things, real politik, and even his most ardent opponents' hatred for always contains an ounce of respect. 

The gesture of nominating Kissinger for the Russian Academy of Sciences can be perceived as Russia demonstrating its willingness to listen even to its geopolitical opponents. Russia supports a realistic approach and sober consideration of national interests, as opposed to the current American elite.

Screen capture from In the Now video A TALE OF TWO CITIES 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times' The best of times '” that's Mosul. The liberation of the city from ISIS is going apace, with the US Air Force assisting Iraq. Yes, the resistance is fierce, and there will be door-to-door fighting, but the day of deliverance is coming -- a summary of NPR this morning. 
No war crimes, not even any mention of civilian casualties under the euphemism of 'collateral damage." And Mosul is never called "a city under siege"! 
The worst of times '” that's Aleppo, "a city under siege." This is where Dictator Assad and the Russians are deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure under the condemnation of the western world for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Thus speak the parrots, with one voice, following Mark C. Toner's press briefings. And NPR is there to remind us that Kerry wants Russian war crimes investigated [' Russia's bombing of civilians in Syria "beg for an appropriate investigation of war crimes."']  and to remind us that Russia is bombing hospitals . 
Never a mention of the besieged being ISIS!  
Listening to CNN and NPR (National PR), no one would ever guess that it's the same struggle in each city, a struggle to liberate innocent civilians from the headchoppers of ISIS. But in Mosul, NPR acknowledges that the innocent civilians are forced to stay and serve as human shields for ISIS. 
Your retired Latin prof translator/commentator keeps up with the help of Facebook friends in 35 countries. Comparing the international posts and comments with the American ones points out the irony. One of them, in Romania, has been advised to 'Stop watching RT and other Russian-biased sources.'  
But in Romania, there is no access to Fox, CNN, or even to NPR. So what is the poor Rumanian to do?  And in another bingo for Godwin's law, the one advising against trusting RT calls Trump 'another Hitler.' 
In the following response to a report of 300 civilians killed in a US airstrike,  
there is a mix of the rational, yet it is still written through the lens of CNN and the rest of western MSM: 'I am a little defensive that some of these stories have come from RT (not this one) when Russia is deliberately targeting civilians and basically you could argue we need to try harder to avoid them.  It is an area with a high damned if you do (potentially causing collateral deaths) and damned if you don't (thus allowing ISIS to spread and kill civilians directly) quotient.'  To which the only possible reply:  
look at what you wrote! OUR airstrikes cause "collateral damage;" Russian airstrikes "deliberately target civilians." The collusion of the western press with the Washington Blob took a month or two to take hold: There was a time, early in 2014, when talking heads were saying stuff like 'Ukraine should just make the best deal they can with Russia.' One retired French politician noted there is no sense getting involved in matters of what used to be internal boundaries of the Soviet Union. CNN as late as September of 2014 once acknowledged that the Kiev government was bombing civilians .   

But not any more! All the non-Russia-biased media have long since gotten the memo. 

And to avoid intellectual discomfort from exposure to views and news that do not jibe with the US State Department and CNN, don't watch RT or any Russia-biased sources!

The Donetsk People's Republic is discussing opening five new representative offices in EU countries similar to the one already established in Czech Republic. This was announced by the acting minister of foreign affairs of the self-proclaimed republic, Natalya Nikonorova.  
Nikonorova recalled that the DPR's first representative office is already successfully working in Czech Republic and a program for its activities until the end of the year has been worked out.  
'We are very grateful to Mrs. Nela Liskova, our representative in the Czech Republic with whom we've worked in this direction, as well as the citizens of the Czech Republic, who are not indifferent to us,' the DPR's foreign minister expressed thanks. 
'Now we plan to open several more such centers in Europe. In total, around five are under development for now,' Nikonorova reported. 
The diplomat remarked that there are several challenges facing the DPR on this matter. 'Not all states and not all governments in Europe are friendly and sympathetic towards the DPR. But we are working through the laws of every state in order to open our centers there in accordance with state legislation, so that there would be no possibility to reproach us,' she stated. 

Nikonorova also expressed hope that attitudes towards the DPR will change for the better in many countries of Europe in the future.

November 3, 2016 - Fort Russ -  Yurasumy, PolitRussia - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


On October 27th, 2016, the heads of the Verkhovna Rada committee on culture and freedom of speech, Ruslan Knyazhnitsky and Viktoriya Syumar, put forth a bill which, besides guaranteeing new preferences for the Ukrainian language, proposes to ban Russian-language print products. It's not difficult to understand this Russophobia. For 25 years, they have been struggling to oust the Russian language from official usage in the country, but the last decade has shown the futility of their attempts. The Russian language is becoming the language of communication among the youth of Ukrainian cities, even those who earlier spoke Ukrainian. 
Language is the beginning of everything  
When in the middle of the 19th century the construction of Ukrainian self-identity began, its foundation was largely based on the language principle. It was then that scholars of the Russian Empire began to create a map of the Russian language with its division into dialects. For theorists, the geographical distribution of the Malorossiyan dialect (in the terminology of the late 19th-early 20th centuries)  was the first wave of the construction of the Ukrainian 'nation', the place where experiments in creating the 'Ukraine is not Russia' theory began.  
It was in this time that a literary language and grammar were created. Literature and community began to take shape around them. This process coincided with another process: the mass exodus of villagers to the city.  
From the village to the city 
In this article, we will not consider the economic causes of this displacement, but note that it was this relocation that allowed the Ukrainian intelligentsia to very quickly find followers and consistently maintain their number. The mass exodus of Ukrainian-speaking masses of people to the cities allowed for the formation of an interlayer very easily subjected to 'Ukrainianization.'  
This was largely a poor mass of people, only recently serfs, who saw in Russian-speaking city-dwellers some kind of other, alien group of people. Naturally, they felt a kind of alienation towards this group. Language became their main criterion of 'us vs. the other.' Circles and communities appeared, the ultimate result of which was the emergence of the idea 'Ukraine is not Russia.' 
The first to systematize this in a globally historic work was Mikhail Grushevsky, who before 1917 started to write his History of Ukraine-Rus . No one should be deceived by the title of this book. Its main leitmotif was that Ukraine is not Russia and that the two have always been antagonistic ever since the time of princely quarrels.  
The city wins 
During the second half of the 19th century, masses of peasants poured into the cities. Their children went to schools and colleges, became workers and civil servants, and many even rose higher up the social ladder of the empire. But the vast majority of them in their first and at least second generations became Russian-speaking.  
New and new masses of peasants came to replace them.  The melting pot of the empire worked fine until the empire itself ceased to exist. 1917 destroyed many of the state's institutions, including integration ones. The resulting ideological gap was quickly filled with doctrines telling yesterday's and today's Ukrainian peasants why they live so badly and who is to blame. Seventy years later, the supporters of the new theory 'quickly found answers' to all the current issues of society and brought the country to ruin. The outbreak of bloody civil strife and more of the same ruin in the West did not allow the problem to drag on for decades, and was quickly resolved'¦ 
Even taking into account the early USSR's acceleration of the process of Ukrainianization, strong resistance to this process in the cities was evident. The youth gradually Russified and the ongoing process of industrialization contributed to the rapid movement of the labor force and its linguistic unification, which was possible only on the basis of the Russian language. Nevertheless, in the 1950's-1960's, the problem of reteaching 'Ukrainian' students in Soviet universities still existed. This was uncomfortable, so in the 1970's the Ukrainian language was finally put on the back burner in the schools of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.  
At the time, it was normal in Ukrainian city families, in which the parents had left for the city from the countryside, to speak in Ukrainian or Surzhyk (in Eastern Ukraine). But at work and in schools, children grew up and communicated in Russian. Usually, the children of parents who moved to the city gradually moved on to communicating in Russian and it turned out that the melting pot of the USSR worked exactly like the Russian Empire did 100 years before, when Malorossiyan villagers were quickly made into Russians in the cities.  
But history went down another roundabout... 
Attempt #2 
The collapse of the USSR, like the collapse of the Russian Empire, offered a second chance to the apologists of the idea of 'Ukraine is not Russia.' They long and carefully planned 'pedagogical' plans and, as soon as the iron curtain fell, the first wave of 'teachers' came to Ukraine from the West. There is no point in dwelling in detail on the technicalities of the work of this and all other 'reformer' groups, but their successes by the mid-2010's were impressive.  
Preschool, school, and higher education in Ukraine became almost entirely held in the Ukrainian language. Russian culture and language were driven off of TV and the radio. Russian speaking print was not only discouraged, but often persecuted. It would seem like this was the last nail in the coffin, but this time the Ukrainian 'patriotic' intelligentsia began to all the more strongly demand that authorities fight for the purity of the Ukrainian logic because 'all was lost.'  
So what's the deal? What do these 'fighters' for the Ukrainian language lack today? 
The 21st century against Ukrainianization 
The point is that what has repeatedly happened in the history of Ukraine happened again. With each passing year, its territory began to feel the work of the empire's melting pot. But where did this come from without an existing empire? Every child in Ukraine received their first mobile phone in elementary school and then their smartphone. Today, it is easy to imagine a student in school without textbooks or notebooks, but they never forget their smartphone.  
The mobile phone was a window to a larger world, the world of social networking. And it just so happened that there were no popular Ukrainian-language social networks, but there were Russian-language ones. Just like there were English-language ones. The age-old affinity between the peoples of Ukraine and Russia played its role here. A child in elementary school doesn't know foreign languages, but Russian is habitual and almost native for him. 
Around 80% of Ukrainian children are on VKontakte, which is by and large in Russian. Thus, it turns out that in many provincial Ukrainian cities which logically should have long since been finally Ukrainianized, children spoke Ukrainian in elementary school only to speak Surzhyk in middle school, and then, in upper classes to a significant degree outside of their families, became Russians-speakers.  
I studied this phenomenon in my own children and their friends and relatives'¦.There are exceptions, but relatively few.  
Children's interests take their toll, and this is why the advocates of total Ukrainianization are in panic today. They see that they are losing and and cannot offer anything in return. They demand and demand, bringing the situation to insanity, and then still lose'¦. 
Consequences 
Thus, the information revolution has struck the bottom of the ship of 'Ukraine is not Russia.' Youth are very quickly Russifying and there is no chance of stopping this process. Even people moving from the village, the eternal saviors of 'patriots,' are drying up. Moreover, children from the cities have stopped going back to the villages and absorb the customs and culture of their ancestors, of whom there are none left alive. They have no one to go to. 

The internet is teaching Ukrainian children, making them largely stupid, but also Russians. Hence why today such ugly formations as Azov, the Azov Civil Corpus, and its latest incarnation in the National Corpus have been born out of the bosom of the Maidan. The vast majority of people in them are Russians trying to find a basis for how to become Ukrainian nationalists. It is clear that confrontation can no longer be built on the basis of language. They have to find new reasons to be non-Russians or, rather, Russians who want to build on the territory of the former USSR and beyond its borders a new integration project - Greater Eurasia'¦

November 3, 2016 -  By Eduard Popov for Fort Russ - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


On November 1st, the news came from the Hague that the Netherlands, in exchange for ratifying the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, could demand that the EU guarantee in writing that this agreement will not be the first step to making Ukraine a real member of the community. A bit earlier, the Dutch government stated that it had postponed the decision on agreeing to the EU-Ukraine association agreement. Moreover, in April, a referendum was held in which more than 60% of Dutch citizens voted against the EU-Ukraine agreement. All of the parliaments of the EU's member countries have already ratified it, except the Netherlands. 
The ruling circles of the Netherlands are trying to circumvent the results of the nationwide referendum that put a barrier in the way of Ukraine's path to the EU. Figuratively speaking, this is to slide between the Scylla of the Eurobureaucracy's pressure and the Charybdis of the Dutch people's opinion.  
Brussels is trying to pressure Russia by supporting Ukraine. Hence why the results of the Dutch referendum, which said 'no' to Ukrainian Eurointegration, are of much more than mere local significance.  
The opinion of this Dutch people is the opinion of all the peoples of Europe who do not want to see such a problematic country of 40 million people - with war on its territory and a history of downing planes - in the European Union. But the Eurobureaucracy and European politicians, if necessary, will wipe their feet on the results of the people's self-expression as long as the free trade zone between Ukraine and the EU is operating and benefiting only one side - the European exporters of finished products and European importers of raw materials. 
Even more recently, abolishing the anti-Russian sanctions was discussed in European capitals. However, the aggravation of antagonisms between the US and Russia in Syria has forced Europe's Washington-dependent leaders to reconsider the fate of sanctions policy.  
Back in early July, in an interview published on Fort Russ, the Italian columnist Max Bonelli expressed skepticism over the prospects of the anti-Russian sanctions being abolished. His words sounded a discordant note for the Russian reader, since the belief prevails in Russia that the sanctions will soon be lifted, or at most prolonged for only half a year. After a series of interviews with prominent European experts, I became convinced that Bonelli's opinion is correct. 
Alexander Gegalchiy, a well known activist of the Russian World in Czech Republic, even believes that European countries (especially Eastern European ones) could open the door for Ukrainian migration. In their opinion, this would be better than accepting refugees and pseudo-refugees from the Middle East. This dilemma calls for a different view on the possibility of a visa-free regime between Ukraine and the EU.  
Earlier, I categorically denied this possibility. But now, following my European partners, I've come to the conclusion that Europe could opt for this step. And not for a better life, as we say in Russia, but in order to avoid the greater evil of uncontrolled migration from the countries of the Middle East.  
Meanwhile, Turkey will probably not achieve its tactical goal of establishing a visa-free regime with the EU, as it has a population two times larger than Ukraine and is a strong power in political, military, and economic terms. And it is a country with a Muslim population. Europe, despite talk of tolerance, is afraid of Muslim migration and is not in a position to integrate even the Muslim community already living on its territory. Therefore, it is a paradox that weak Ukraine has greater chances of achieving a visa-free regime than strong Turkey. 
A visa-free regime is, of course, not membership in the EU, but is a significant step in the direction of Europe. If it is introduced, then the leaders of the Ukrainian state will have a major argument for propagandizing the successes of the 'path to Europe.' Millions of Ukrainians will go to the EU (specifically Eastern European countries) and take the place of Muslim migrants. The EU could create obstacles on the ground level, but even so, the doors to Ukrainian migration will be open. I'll repeat: this will not be a victory of Ukraine's Eurointegrationists, but a necessary concession in the face of unpleasantries considered graver than those posed by Ukrainian migration. 

Relations between Russia and the EU are most likely to go downhill. The leader of the EU, Germany, in the face of Chancellor Angela Merkel, is literally coercing Europe to travel down the harmful path of anti-Russian sanctions and anti-Russian policies overall.  
This situation can only be changed by a simultaneous victory in several countries of more sane political forces, not necessarily pro-Russian, but pro-European. Next year, 2017, is election year in the locomotive countries of the EU - France and Germany. Will we see a sensation in these elections? I'm not sure, but there will be surprises for sure.

On October 27th, 2016, as a result of joint operative-investigative activities between Russian and Turkish intelligence, in Instanbul were arrested leaders and active participants of an underground gang from the North Caucasus region and Crimea, who were hiding from Russian law enforcement on Turkish territory.  
During the course of the operation, representatives of the Crimean branch of Hizb -ut-Tahrir and the North Caucasus wing of ISIS, totaling 80 people, were arrested. 


In line with the agreement with Turkey's intelligence services, their extradition to Russia is being resolved. 

A high-ranking source in security structures explained to Russian Spring that Turkish intelligence services' transfer of information on the Crimean Tatar and North Caucasus terrorist network to the Russian side, timed for the meeting between Putin and Erdogan in Sochi, was a gesture of thanks for intelligence warnings about the coup that failed in July, 2016.

Right now, an angry crowd of veterans from the Chernobyl clean-up have gathered in front of the Kiev Verkhovna Rada: They are not receiving their benefits. The crowd tried to storm the parliament, so their deputies would hear then out and start to act rather than just shrug all over again.

Now the event is gaining an even larger scale as two thousand teachers have joined the Chernobyl cleanup veterans. A column of teachers partially blocked traffic for vehicles on Grushevskogo street.

The demands of the teachers are simple and reasonable: raise our wages, and not just yours, and cancel the increase in tariffs, which was physically impossible to pay since they are higher than the salaries.

The fatcat deputies of the Verkhovna Rada and the Prime Minister, who backdated salary increases for themselves and the president, have brought the citizens of Ukraine to the limit, as people take to the streets and storm City Councils. Recently in Vinnitsa protesters tried to storm the city council and the break in to the session hall.

"No need for Ukrainian youth in migrant-saturated Europe, but it's easy to find earnings in Russia" 

From the "Square:" a mass exodus of Ukrainians to Russia 

The symbol of the new year in Ukraine may be a Cossack Vakula* that flies over precincts in St. Petersburg. Or a deserted farm near Little Russian Dikanka, a hut where the wind sings through the windows. Ukrainians are rushing to Russia not for overseas slippers, but for daily bread. They run from the country with their families, together with their farm neighbors, leaving forever. 

1/4  WON'T RETURN 

Members of the International human rights organization Human Rights Action (HRA) said that over the past year in Ukraine, where over the last 10 years the population has decreased from 48 to 42 million, more than three million people have left for Russia! And according to European researchers the depopulation going on in the Ukraine  is about to cause a social explosion. 

This is what the Prime Minister of Ukraine Vladimir Groisman acknowledged at one of the recent sessions of the government. In the session there was talk that Ukraine in the next year may be deprived of its last support - the agricultural sector. The land will soon have no one to work it, as it's the elderly who remain in the villages. 

Ukrainian youth  are not needed  in the Europe that is now supersaturated with migrants, but it is easy to find earnings in Russia. 

Kiev media also are actively discussing the warning of Oleksandr Okhrimenko, President of the Ukrainian Analytical Center. He made the forecast  that in the next year the migratory flow from the Ukraine could grow by half, and a quarter of those who left would change citizenship, and will work in Russia. 

20 MILLION LEAVE 

The Russian Interior Ministry notes a sharp increase in the flow of migrants from Ukraine. It is expected that in the second half of October 25-30 thousand migrant workers more than usual will arrive in Russia from Ukraine. Already 80-85 thousand Ukrainian citizens arrive per week. Basically they come to us in search of work. At the same time, it is no longer about the residents of the Donbass, who fled from the war. It is very real ethnic Ukrainians, from the western regions. 

In Ukraine, some experts are trying to support the version of this as a seasonal phenomenon: it is said, the potato harvest is done on the farms and now they have gone to earn some cash on Russian construction sites. But experts at "KP" argue that it's not just that. 

- The economic crisis has gotten worse in the Ukraine, as people are looking for any stable earnings and Poroshenko has once again shown that Ukrainians are not needed in Europe. They are not needed either as migrant workers or as visa-free visitors, Yuri Moskovski told the correspondent of "Komsomolskaya Pravda." Moskovski is chairman of the National Affairs Council in the Government of Moscow, and the Foundation projects director, international relations for the Neighbourhood Foundation.   

"They always find their niche on the Russian labor market. Our task is to receive them, place, and help them to adapt. The migration from the Ukraine will continue to grow."** When the Zaporozhye army swore oaths to Russia, about 700 thousand people lived there. When Ukraine left the Soviet Union, there were more than 50 million citizens, and now in fact - 38. But Bandera said in his time time that for the Ukraine to establish a national state a population of 20 million would do. His successors have chosen his path. They are stubbornly headed to depopulation. 

There are several reasons why the citizens of Ukraine began to recuse their nationality, and leave for Russia with their families. Though last year the Ukrainians were free to come to Russia and work, while remaining in the background with other migrants virtually invisible to law enforcement, the migration rules have become stricter this year. 

Under the current legislation a migrant from Ukraine is obliged to register, acquire an INN (Taxpayer ID Number), health insurance, pass an exam on the Russian language, to acquire a work permit, is given a month to get a contract of employment, and has to pay 4000 rubles a month on the permit. Violators are fined, and forcibly expelled with a re-entry restriction for 5-10 years. 

In addition, the Federal Migration Service of Russia, which was engaged in the control of illegal migration, has recently been abolished. The functions of this department were turned over to the Interior Ministry of Russia, a Ministry, which will not only supervise but also achieve results with forceful measures. 

It is because the Ukrainians are in a rush to move to Russia, to obtain residence permits, and Russian citizenship, which gives the right to work without restrictions and additional fees. 

Poroshenko recently added to this determination among his constituents. He put pressure on his people by means of prohibitions on Russian payment systems, and fears of an introduction of a visa regime with Russia. All within the format of the chosen policy: Team Poroshenko clearly is following the precepts of Bandera.

As previously reported by Russian Spring, ISIS' media wing, and the Al-Amak agency, on the evening of November 3rd, a Russian helicopter was shot down near Palmyra in the Khveisis village district in the Syrian province of Homs.  
Later, the Ministry of Defense of Russia denied reports that Russian servicemen were killed. The ministry did confirm that during the execution of a special operation on humanitarian cargo delivery on November 3rd, a Russian military helicopter made an emergency landing 40 kilometers northwest of Palmyra and its crew was successfully evacuated by Russian search and rescue forces.  
Earlier, ISIS terrorists reported that the Russian armed force's helicopter was shot down by a guided missile.  
The terrorists have just published footage of the rescue operation and the destruction of the Mi-35 helicopter in the desert near Palmyra. The video and photos clearly show Russian special forces on armored Tiger cars and KamA3 'Vystrel' evacuating the crew with an Mi-8 military transport helicopter. 


During the rescue helicopter's takeoff, the damaged Mi-35 exploded, after which special forces orderly left the scene on armored vehicles and in the Mi-8. The rescue helicopter shot flares to protect against MPADS. 
On social networks, it has been suggested that the helicopter could have been detonated by special forces because of the impossibility of taking it back to base. According to another theory, the Mi-35 exploded after being hit by an MPAD rocket fired by militants. 
The Center for Reconciliation of Warring Parties in Syria subsequently reported the details of the emergency situation: 'During the inspection of the helicopter by the crew on the scene, the landing area was subjected to mortar fire by militants. The helicopter was damaged, preventing it from independently returning to its air base.'  
The Russian defense ministry also specified that the Mi-35 crew did not suffer and was rapidly evacuated by the search and rescue helicopter to the Russian military base at Hmeimim in the province of Latakia. At the time, the fate of the damaged aircraft was not known. 

The Mi-35 combat helicopter was alleged to have been carrying out the military task of covering a transport helicopter delivering humanitarian aid.

The Cyprus problem is a Russian problem as well. The current purblind negotiations, ostensibly between the two Cypriot communities (82% Greek and 18% Turkish), are strictly directed by NATO under the watchful eye of 40,000 Turkish occupation troops that hold 37% of Cyprus's land and 54% of its shores. At every major juncture in Cyprus' recent history, one finds an obsession with Russia by Britain and its successor in the Eastern Mediterranean (EM), America.  
The Russia factor featured strongly in 1878 and, of course, before. In that year, the Ottomans ceded Cyprus to Britain in exchange for the United Kingdom's military support to the Ottomans (read: Turkish) should Russia attempt to take possession of Ottoman territories in Asia. Here we see the people of Cyprus treated as a commodity and Turkey and Britain acting as traders treating Russia as collateral.  
With the start of WWI, Cyprus was put under British military occupation (1914-1925) and then became a colony of the British crown (1925-1960.) During WWI, when the Turks joined the losing side, Britain promised to cede Cyprus to Greece just as it did in 1864 with some Greek-populated islands. But Britain reneged on its promise perfidiously because of its obsession with keeping Russia in check in the EM. The Treaty of Lausanne of 1923 established the new Turkish state, which in turn formally recognized Britain's sovereignty over Cyprus (Article 20). 
The British distrusted the Greeks because of favorable Greek sentiment towards Russia. Beyond the cultural links between Greeks and Russians, Russia deservedly earned the appreciation of the Greeks. In 1770, at Catherine the Great's behest, the Orlov brothers attempted, although unsuccessfully, to free the Greeks from Turkish bondage. The Greek General Alexander Ypsilanti, who fought against Napoleon as an officer of the Russian Cavalry, led the Greek war of independence against the Turks. The Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ioannis Kapodistrias, was the first Governor of liberated Greece. The battle of Navarino of 1827, that saw the crushing of the Turkish navy, was initiated by Russia (with Rear-Admiral Lodewijk Heyden of the Imperial Russian Navy) and only then, so as not to be left out, did France and Britain (with philhellene Vice-Admiral Edward Codrington) joined the fray. This led to independence in 1829 for some Greek territory.  
Just after WWII, when the issue of Cyprus was raised again, the British toyed with the idea of ceding Cyprus to Greece. The project was stopped when the British (and Americans) cunningly brought up the imaginary danger of Greece falling under communism and ultimately siding with the Soviet Union (read: Russia). Of course, the Yalta agreement prevented such an eventuality (Greece went to the West by 90%) whilst the massive military support the British and Americans gave the anti-communists (many of whom were shadowy characters and collaborators) sealed the communists' fate. 
Here again, the legitimate ambitions of the Greeks of Cyprus were thwarted largely on account of the West's obsession with stopping Russia. 
Years later, after Cyprus was given fettered independence by the British in 1960, NATO accused Cyprus' president of close relations with Cypriot 'communists.' In response, NATO started to work tirelessly towards the dissolution of the Republic of Cyprus (RofCy) out of fear that Russia would use the 'communists' as a wedge to gain entry into Cyprus. All of this was, of course, nonsense.  
So, the British set their sights on replacing the RofCy with a new amalgam to be run 50-50 by the 18% Turks and the 82% Greeks, thereby ushering in minority tyranny and government paralysis. This was meant to meet NATO's two objectives in Cyprus: a.) to set up a regime that would be paralyzed by the Turkish minority's vetoes so that the Greeks would never be able to side with fraternal Russia, and b.) to establish in Cyprus a second NATO (Turkish) presence in addition to Britain's.  
The Americans want - in this order - Cyprus, Crete, and Greece as military staging posts against anyone that dares to refuse to succumb to the American line. In the last twenty years, NATO and co. have used the British military bases in Cyprus regularly to bomb a multitude of countries. Now, NATO is just a step away from meeting both objectives. The first objective has already been met in that the Greek nomenklatura of the last 8 years accepted the dissolution of the RofCy and its replacement by a 50-50 'Frankenstein state.'  
As regards the additional NATO military base on Cyprus, all guns are now trained on the already browbeaten Greek representatives. NATO remains optimistic. In this way, NATO hopes to seal Russia's and Greece's fate in Cyprus - but what has been agreed upon to date will still need to be put to referendum. If the plan goes through, the Greeks will be put on the path to emigration. Uncertainty will reign, conflict will rule, and violence and intimidation against the Greeks will probably be organized from Turkey. In the absence of a serious central government, mass colonization by Turkey will immediately follow, since any mechanisms of control will all but disappear. 
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova was right when she recently accused the West of persistent attempts to speed up negotiations and push for a solution at all costs. She warned of a repeat of the 2004 fiasco when the disastrous NATO-initiated Anan plan (masquerading as a UN plan) was massively rejected by the people of Cyprus and is blatantly supported by those in power now. The same sources continue to support the current NATO plan. Fortunately, there is a huge chasm separating some among the political elite of Cyprus and those who consider the people's desire for a democratic rather than a NATO solution. 
Incidentally, the current administration in Cyprus has repeatedly called on NATO to accept Cyprus in its ranks, forgetting that NATO's primary objective is the encirclement of Russia.  

Russia now needs to stand firm on the side of a democratic solution. Using its vast diplomatic weight, Russia can thwart the current NATO plan before it goes to referendum. A strong Russian position will give courage to the people of Cyprus. If the Greeks surrender, NATO will become the choreographer of Cyprus' political life from now on. Since Greece is merely a sorry bystander, only Russia can save Cyprus. If the NATO plan for Cyprus succeeds, Russia will end up suffering geostrategic casualties and the Greeks of Cyprus will be left as collateral damage.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has been played by a prankster pretending to be the president of Kyrgyzstan.  
On November 2nd, the official website of the Ukrainian president announced that Poroshenko had held a telephone conversation with the president of Kyrgyzstan.  


Hoewever, the head of the presidential administration and deputy head of its department on Kyrgyzstan, Sapar Isakov, subsequently told Interfax that the information was unreliable and suggested that someone had played the Ukrainian president. 
The day before the alleged conversation took place, Russian prankster Aleksey Stolyarov (known as Lexus), famous for his big pranks played on Ukrainian politicians, wrote on his Facebook: 'Are there any specialists on or from Kyrgyzstan here?' 



The famous Ukrainian jurist Andrey Portnov commented on the situation:  
'What turned into nearly an hour long discussion of bilateral relations between the Ukrainian president and the alleged president of Kyrgyzstan should definitely cost the head of the presidential administration his career. This event speaks to the final destruction of the state apparatus and the transformation of its governing institutions into one continuous comedy. Of course, this was made possible thanks to the lustration ongoing in the country, as a result of which a number of inadequate slackers and fools have emerged.'

The US should get rid of the illusion that there is the possibility of 'taming' terrorists, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated.  
'Terrorism is like a snake: you turn your back on it and it bites you. Don't play with it,' she said in an interview to China Radio International. 
Zakharova remarked that Western and regional countries have invested a lot of forces and means in terrorist groupings. 
'But these are terrorists, and they shouldn't be flirted with,' Zakharova added. 
In the diplomat's opinion, the actions of the American side, which is not allowing Jebat Al-Nusra to be destroyed, 'are a clear manifestation of the fact that they are protecting it.'  

Zakharova also noted that this is not the first time that Russia is clashing with such an approach by the US.

Eduard Popov, born in 1973 in Konstantinovka, Donetsk region, is a Rostov State University graduate with a PhD in history and philosophy. In 2008, he founded the Center for Ukrainian Studies of the Southern Federal University of Russia in Rostov-on-Don. From 2009-2013, he was the founding head of the Black Sea-Caspian Center of the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, an analytical institute of the Presidential Administration of Russia. In June 2014, Popov headed the establishment of the Representative Office of the Donetsk People's Republic in Rostov-on-Don. He has actively participated in humanitarian aid efforts in Donbass and has been a guest contributor to various Donbass media, such as the Lugansk-based  Cossack Media Group.  Popov has actively contributed to Fort Russ since June, 2016.

Fort Russ Special Editor Jafe Arnold: Dr. Popov, for nearly half a year already, you have regularly submitted your commentary on global events to Fort Russ. You've covered a number of topics ranging from European politics and the war in Donbass to the possibility of a Third World War breaking out over Syria and the future of Ukraine and Ukrainian nationalism. Before we begin discussing a number of related questions, what would you like to say to your readers at Fort Russ?  
Dr. Eduard Popov:    I consider the rare and somewhat unexpected honor to address you, dear readers of the wonderful analytical site Fort Russ, to be some kind of reward for my future contributions. I see this not as a right, but as a sacred duty of the author before his readers. 

We live in different countries, speak different languages, and share different (ranging from more or less similar to diametrically opposite) worldviews and political opinions. Nevertheless, to some extent, we are all like-minded. The common denominator for all of us is the strong belief that the world is multifaceted and cannot be reduced to only one correct doctrine.  
The history of mankind has seen and will probably still see more than a few attempts at organizing an ideological and political monopoly. The ideology of the American New World Order that claims universality and all-inclusiveness is nothing original and not even clever. As a historian of political ideologies, revolutionary communism in its Trotskyite and Khrushchevite variants also immediately comes to mind, which also claimed for itself the role of ending world history.  
But the era of American domination over the world awaits its finale and is maybe more imminent than many of us expect. I see my own personal mission as an author at Fort Russ to help prepare this finale, which depends on the efforts of every one of us.  
Restoring the violated principle of national sovereignty instead of the idea of one nation's global domination, restoring the 'blooming complexity' of the world's cultures instead of an imposed and dull liberal 'post-culture', and affirming solid moral principles instead of immoral promiscuity - this is a sample program which is shared by the majority of humanity. Most of humanity is opposed to the dominant quasi-religion of American neoliberalism or, rather, the ideology of Pax Americana is opposed to the majority of humanity.  
The events in the former Ukraine and Donbass have become some of the reference points determining each of our's moral position. People from different countries and with opposing political views, from ultra-right to ultra-left, have expressed support for the people of Donbass. And I am very grateful to Fort Russ for constantly striving to present the truth of these events. I've had the opportunity to personally observe the astonishing events in Donbass, and I can say that Donbass' fate is still far from sealed. Together, we are contributing to a more just alternative not only for Donbass, but for all of humanity.  
    Eduard Popov (left), DPR representative in Rostov-on-Don, with Moscow DPR representatives 
Arnold: In this context, how do you assess the state of the ongoing global information war? Are resources like Fort Russ helping to turn the tide against the Atlanticist narrative or 'Pax Americana'? Is bringing together such 'like-minded people' the main goal of this information war?   
Popov: It's difficult for me to assess the state of the whole front of the information war - I don't possess complete information and don't consider myself a specialist in this sphere. I'm simply a political analyst and historian specializing in some topics that are relevant in today's world.  
Nevertheless, I have no doubt as to the benefit that 'new media' brings to the resistance movement. Let me explain these terms. New media means independent publications that do not legally fall under the category of media, but fulfill the same function. This applies to different websites and groups on social media. The 'resistance movement' (I don't think the origin of the term needs to be explained) is a synonym for anti-globalism or, as has become fashionable to say now, the anti-mainstream.   
If De Gaulle's movement fought against the Nazi occupation of France with weapons in hand, then today's fighters of the resistance fight mainly with information against an occupant operating not so much with direct physical violence as with distanced coercion, i.e., informational, psychological, economic, and political force, etc.  
Can it be said that the fight against this new occupation is more difficult? As a historian by education and a philosopher (my doctoral dissertation was on the political philosophy of conservatism), I believe that the world has now arrived at the complete breaking point of one historical epoch and the beginning of another. Perhaps it wouldn't be so wrong to compare the current era with the era of the collapse of the Roman Empire, first and foremost because ahead of us is most likely a dark ages comparable to the early Middle Ages, and a new Great Migration of peoples. Of course, not everything is the same, but I won't focus on this now. I'll just say that there are not too many reasons for historical optimism.  
Resources such as Fort Russ have taken on the extremely important mission of speaking the truth in an epoch of great lies. 'Big' official publications in Europe are filled with lies. And this is not only my opinion. All the thinking, honest europeans with whom I've discussed the situation of the press in 'united Europe' also think so. Hence why, as my friends in European countries have noted, independent media has a growing circle of readership. In my opinion, this trend is a long-term one.  
As for what I believe is necessary to concentrate efforts on, the first step has already been done. The minimum social anti-mainstream has been formed in Europe. This has been done primarily thanks to the efforts of the independent press. But in my opinion, the task fulfilled at this first stage has goals primarily centered around negation, i.e., proving what is wrong and dangerous in globalism.  
The anti-mainstream wields an unusually rich diversity of worldviews and ideological shades ranging from Marxism to certain currents of fascism to even clerical monarchism. Why not use this methodological richness for forming a united, anti-globalist intellectual front? Then we can proceed to solve constructive tasks, such as discussing the foundations of a future, more just world order.  
In no case should the resistance movement identify as marginals - this is precisely how the 'Ministry of Truth' tries to present it. If a number of new media take on the mission of creating platforms for intellectual discussions with others, then this will undoubtedly become one of the main tasks of the information war. Even the leader of the Bolsheviks, Vladimir Lenin, spoke of a newspaper as a center not only of publications, but as a center for party work. I don't know if the creators of new media have read Lenin, but they are acting according to his methodological precepts.  

Arnold:  A t the present moment, o ne of the centers of attention of the information war and what you called the 'resistance' is the threat of a Third World War being unleashed by the US. Russian experts have different opinions on how realistic such a turn is. Considering that you say there is little reason to be historically optimistic, what do you think?   
Popov: The topic of WW3 is really actively being discussed in Russian expert circles, yet all the while has the status of some kind of fantasy. But as I said earlier, we are now witnessing the breaking point of not only a historical period (what Immanuel Wallerstein calls the American Century century lasting since 1945), but a change in historical epochs.  
This can be compared with the collapse of the Roman Empire or the collapse of the Middle Ages and the onset of the Modern Age. The Russian philosophers of the emigration in the 1920's foresaw this shift of epochs and called it the New Middle Ages. Perhaps this was also an anticipation of fascism, which lasted a comparatively brief historical period.  
In my opinion, this also anticipates the New Middle Ages, but with only one necessary correction: this will be a new early Middle Ages, not the High Middle Ages of great Romano-Germanic culture which the Russian philosopher Konstantin Leontyev considered to be the highest achievement of humanity, but the 'dark ages' that preceded it - barbarism, the plague, the collapse of the great ancient cultures, and the mass migration of peoples. A very vivid impression of these centuries is offered by the German epics (the genesis of the historical basis of the Nibelungenlied dates back to the dark ages and the invasion of Attila the Hun) and Scandinavian mythology, especially the tale of the death of the gods.  
This change of epochs is primarily being prepared on mental grounds. I believe that the conditions are ripe for this: the Western world has finally turned into a post-Christian and partially anti-Christian entity. It's difficult for me to say whether Europe has enough life left in it to oppose the new onslaught of the Caliphate - I have in mind Muslim migration to the European continent and the expansion of Salafist networks. The answer is more likely no than yes.  
America is also going through very difficult times, although its difficulties are of an entirely different nature. Wallerstein long ago said that the age of American domination is coming to an end and will end with a grandiose crash. This conclusion is in a certain measure shared by the ideologist of Pax Americana, Brzezinski, who called to negotiate, not to prevent, but to slow down the collapse of the American Empire. 
The Americans have a very high level of strategic thought. Both times that America entered a world war on the European continent, it achieved grand strategic successes with very little blood shed (compared to the European Allies and Axis). There are many works that, substantiated by references to historical sources, show that the US stood behind the scenes of WW2 and pushed European rivals to war. The US entered the war as the most powerful economy on the planet and came out with the status of a superpower, the successor to the British Empire. The US' GDP increased 10 times in only a few years. 
We can also see outstanding, though not as tremendous achievements of American geopolitics in WW1. Europe was gushing blood, but the United States profited from and became stronger because of the war between European competitors, even the British. Now that the age of the USA is coming to an end, they are faced with the threat of having to drastically reduce their appetites, busy themselves with overhauling renovations at home, and turn from the lord of the world into a first among equals.  
I am almost sure that the US will not go down the path of isolationism for psychological (the inertia of imperial power is very strong) and economic reasons. This means they will continue down the path of foreign expansion. 
Russia and China are becoming all the more stronger and independent rivals of the US. Russia is increasing its military power, while China is increasing its economic power, even though it should be noted that China and the US are vitally needed by each other as economic partners at the present stage. Meanwhile, Europe does not wield geopolitical subjectivity and remains the US' junior partner, but this is threatening its overall economic and productive capacity which is surpassing the US.  
I'll suggest an opinion and perhaps re-invent the wheel: the 'Arab Spring' was sponsored by the Americans in order to organize a new great migration of peoples to Europe. In the long and even medium term, the Islamic World is not an ally of the US, but in the short term such an alliance is possible. American strategists are using the mixing of peoples and languages to greatly weaken their European competitors.  
Other tools are being used against China and Russia, and this toolbox is quite large. The Americans have attempted to wage a cheap war against Russia by creating a powerful protest movement against President Putin. Perhaps we can already say that this venture failed. The Russian people and other peoples of the Russian Federation, unlike their Ukrainian neighbors, wield historical and state wisdom and are ready to endure hardships in the face of an external enemy. This makes war almost inevitable. Time is working against the US and for Russia. 
By 2020 or 2025, the program of rearming the Armed Forces of Russia should be completed, and the economy is not in the best condition, but can still cope with crises. Therefore, I'll repeat, war is an inevitable way out of the impasse.  
Will this be a real Third World War? In my opinion, this is unlikely. In one of my articles , I've already employed the notion of a 'flank war.' The Americans are largely fighting by proxies - Polish, Ukrainian, and Muslim-Salafist ones, etc. The almost inevitable (in my opinion) victory of Hillary Clinton will add psychological motives to this war. What is entailed in this scenario? Two things: (1) the Russians and Americans will fight without the use of strategic nuclear weapons and on fronts far away from US shores - otherwise, the cure for the American Empire, war, would be worse than the disease; (2) I am sure that the American hegemon will be defeated in this war. And this offers the opportunity to begin to liberate Europe, and for Russia this means the opportunity to finally throw off the burdensome shackles of American tutelage.

In a truly shocking twist, the Supreme Court of Austria has decided to acquit the Iraqi man, "that may not have realised the 10-year-old Austrian boy did not want to be sexually abused by him." Amir, 20, was visiting the Theresienbad pool in the Austrian capital of Vienna in December 2015, as part of a trip to encourage integration, when the incident occurred.  
Europe - if you can't stand up for your children, who will? Of course there is the fact that Western Europe has supported the US in their violent destruction of the Middle East over the past 20 years. Is it a guilty conscience that seems to appease the blatant criminal activity on behalf of some newcomers? Or are they Soros puppets implanted into the judicial system that are at work? 
Russia is a multicultural and multi-religious society, and has been for 1000 years. The law applies to everyone equally - whether you're a Crimean Tatar or a Slavic Russian - every Russian citizen is 'native' as such and subject to the same protocols.

Russia and Greece plan to circumvent sanctions, launch joint projects November 4, 2016 - Fort Russ News - PolitRussia - translated by J. Arnoldski - During Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's visit to Greece, the development of plans for bypassing the anti-Russian sanctions was discussed. This has been reported by Izvestiya newspaper with references to a source in foreign policy circles. During the meeting, Russia and Greece recognized the negative consequences of the anti-Russian sanctions imposed by the EU and the responsive embargo. 'Greece, which supplies a large portion of agricultural products in Russia, has suffered more than many of its EU colleagues. According to data from Russia's Federal Customs Service, in 2014 trade turnover decreased by 39.2% and in 2015 by 34%. However, Russia and Greece are searching for a solution to this problem. A source in Russian foreign policy circles has told Izvestiya that Moscow proposed Athens to circumvent the sanctions through the creation of joint ventures in the framework of the Russian-Greek Commission on Economic, Industrial, and Scientific-Technical Cooperation,' the article reads. According to the source, Russia cannot make exceptions for a single country, therefore it has proposed 'combined production.' 'In the near future, we expect a response from the Greek side on this matter. This question was raised at the talks in Athens,' the source remarked. Follow us on Facebook!

The Russian president's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, has replied to NATO General Secretary Jens Stolstenberg's statement on strengthening forces due to Russia's 'activeness.' The Kremlin's spokesperson categorized such as evidence of the 'aggressive nature of NATO' and recalled that the blocs which NATO members opposed have long since disappeared, but the alliance's behavior has not changed. 
'Stoltenberg's statement once again testifies to the aggressive nature of this organization. Despite the fact that the counter-bloc to NATO no longer exists, still this nature is impossible to eradicate for ideological and political reasons,' Peskov is quoted as saying by TASS.  
The approach of NATO military infrastructure up to the borders of the Russian Federation is a fact indicative of the aggressive intentions of the alliance. Meanwhile, 'in terms of ensuring its national security, Russia is acting within its borders and these actions do not threaten anyone,' Putin's press secretary added. 

Jens Stoltenberg earlier stated that NATO is planning to transfer a portion of its troops to strengthen its operations in response to Russia's activities.

Militants in Syria have filmed their 'meeting' with Russian air forces in Aleppo.  
In the footage released, the bandits are heating themselves by a small fire before one of them says that a Russian fighter is approaching. The militant says 'Allahu akbar, the Russians are here!' The rest of the group begin to look up in the sky as the roar of Russian military aircraft is suddenly heard above them.  

The terrorists then run in terror and disperse in different directions, falling onto the ground and dropping their dishes.

November 7, 2016 -  Aleksey Ilyashevich, PolitRussia - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


How has life changed in Donbass compared to before the war? For a person who hasn't had the opportunity to personally visit the Donetsk People's Republic, answering this question is not easy. Experts argue themselves hoarse on TV screens and instill the most different impressions in us, ranging from Donbass being paradise on earth to a semi-starving ghetto. Where is the truth? As always, the truth is somewhere in the middle.  
Of course, life in the DPR is far from our usual ideas about wellbeing, but war doesn't change people's lives for the better. Let's set aside our usually loaded judgements and look at the problem from the other side. Over the past few years of war, the people of Donbass have encountered processes and phenomena with which they never had to deal in peacetime. Some of them are negative and some are positive, but many are difficult to evaluate. They simply exist, and they often offer a better picture of life in the DPR than dry statistics. What exactly are we dealing with? 
Curfew 
It is very difficult to adapt to curfew, especially for those who returned to the republics' cities after a lengthy absence, for which they risk spending a night at the local police department. A second violation threatens 15 days of detention. The curfew lasts from 23:00 until 5:00, but by 22:00 all drinking and entertainment establishments are supposed to be closed so that people can make it home in time. A special permit is needed to be on the streets at night. This equally applies to soldiers. 
Police law allows law enforcement to act against violators of the curfew very decisively, including up to the use of firearms if necessary. 
The curfew has been enforced in the DPR since 2014. Since then, it has only been cancelled once - for last year's New Year's Eve. The purpose of such measures is not only protecting citizens, but also preventing the DPR territory's penetration by the enemy's sabotage-reconnaissance groups. Most people have already become accustomed to the curfew, but they still don't stop complaining about it (especially young people).  Without a doubt, the curfew regime has been one of the most tangible changes in the lives of the republic's population. 
Humanitarian aid 
Compared with 2014 and 2015, the role of humanitarian aid has significantly dropped, but it still comes in to help pensioners whose incomes don't allow them to purchase all the necessary products. However, it is not only pensioners that receive humanitarian aid, as certain humanitarian aid is specifically provided to patients with diabetes, families with young children, and other vulnerable parts of the population. Deliveries are kept streaming in and, as a rule, problems usually don't arise. 


Humanitarian aid came to Donbass along with the war and became firmly established as part of life in every home. Today it is difficult to find a family in which no one stands in line to receive humanitarian aid. 
Lines 
Two years of life in semi-wartime conditions has brought many difficulties to the republic's inhabitants. One of the most noticeable is the rise of queues. It sometimes seems like life here has turned into one big line - lines to the bank, lines for humanitarian aid, lines for salaries (stipends and pensions as well), lines at checkpoints, and lines at the customs checkpoint when going to Russia 
The main trend in lines in 2016 has been the queues for registering for and receiving passports of the Donetsk People's Republic. 
If the passport office begins to accept citizens at 9:00, then people start forming a queue at 5:00. Even those lines which existed before the war have now become even longer with the exception, perhaps, of shop lines. The state apparatus itself is most often at fault, especially since it is more bureaucratized than before the war. But that's another story. 
The revival of sports 
The professional football, basketball, and hockey teams of Donetsk left, so now youth sports are developing much more actively than before. Competitions for young people in different cities of the republic are held with stunning regularity. Caring Russians have contributed to developing sports and the DPR is actively represented and participates in championships in Russia. 
A recent example: the students sports club called Red Profintern from the city of Enakievo took part in the Russian Taekwondo Cup at the All-Russian Qualifying Tournament for the 2016 world championships of martial arts. Before the war, children never participated in sports at such a level.  
Children play football in a camp for refugees from Donbass in Russia's Rostov region 
The authorities of the Donetsk People's Republic have not bet on sports by coincidence. Maintaining youth in an unrecognized state is possible by opening up a sporting future. There are simply no other effective ways. This explains the rapid development of youth sports. 
The republic's media 
Journalism in the DPR today is, unfortunately, at a low level. Many Donbass journalists left during the war. The shortage of personnel has been filled by young people who continue to grow into the place of their older colleagues. Nevertheless, the process of forming and developing a republican media is in full swing. 
Four television channels operate on the territory of the DPR along with several radio stations, and almost every city has an urban mass newspaper. Local media are developing much more actively today than in the prewar period, as often only they can quickly provide reliable information on what is happening in the state.  
Changes to school curriculum  
Curriculum in schools and university has remained fundamentally the same as it was before the war, but certain changes have occurred. Above all, this affects history. If earlier pupils and students studied the history of Ukraine, then today it has been replaced by the history of the Fatherland. By Fatherland is meant Donbass, which is considered in the context of both Ukrainian and Russian history. 
Something similar is occurring with law students, who have had a hard time. For example, in constitutional law courses, they have to study three constitutions at once: the Ukrainian, Russian, and republican ones.  
Ukrainian language and literature have not been removed. The number of hours of these subjects remains at the pre-war level. The poets and writers are the same. Even Taras Shevchenko and his displeasure with Tsarist policies has been left in the books. 
But what has really changed is the situation with admission into universities. If earlier graduates passed the External Independent Testing (similar to the Russian Unified State Exam), then today they have to pass school exams as a result of which they can enroll. The state examinations differ little in assessment though, as the questions are developed according to the same scheme. 
Education in the DPR has been declared to have transitioned to Russian standards. But by this is understood rather things of a technical nature, while the content of curricula in secondary and higher educational institutions has undergone only some minor changes. 
The quality of roads and streets 
The state of roads in the republic, like before, still leaves much to be desired, but the DPR authorities began to handle this as early as 2014. A team of workers laying asphalt is for today's Donetsk a picture more than ordinary. Even driveways are being repaired. They might not be much better as a rule, but it's difficult to judge things under shelling. 
Speaking of automobile roads in Donbass, they've been 'unloaded' over the years of war, as there are fewer cars. Their number sharply declined during the spring and summer of 2014, when many owners left personal vehicles outside of the republic or feared to exploit their iron horses - using their positions, some 'privatizers' acting in the name of the militia didn't hesitate to 'commandeer' cars. 
In 2015, the city gradually started to be flooded by cars again, but the pre-war traffic still doesn't threaten the republic's roads.  


More than a little has been said about how Donetsk's frontline streets are cleaner than streets in peace-enjoying Kiev. There are several reasons for this.  
First of all, there is the selfless work of public services, whose employees have been under fire and killed or received severe injuries. 
Secondly, the attitude of the people of Donbass towards their city has changed over the war, so they litter significantly less. Thanks to this, Donetsk's appearance, as well as that of other cities of the republic, has really changed for the better. 
The cleanliness of streets is one of the main positive changes of recent years.  
The ruble zone and Russian goods 
In 2015, the DPR introduced the ruble into circulation alongside the Ukrainian hryvnia. On the republic's territory was declared a so-called multi-currency zone, where purchases could be paid for in hryvnia, rubles, or even dollars. I myself was witness to when a woman bought bread with a $100 bill and the clerk gave her change in rubles. 
However, the Russian currency quickly established a monopoly. Today, all financial transactions on the republic's territory are done in rubles.  
A small mass of hryvnia remains thanks to the workers of Ukrainian enterprises on DPR territory, who are paid their wages in hryvnia. The republic's transition to a ruble zone is one of the key changes for residents of the DPR. 
Goods from Ukrainian manufacturers are almost gone from DPR shelves. Instead of them are products from Russia and Belarus. By and large, the Ukrainian blockade contributed to the resulting product vacuum being filled by competitors. As a result, Ukrainian business lost a multimillion dollar market which fell into the hands of the 'Moskal' [derogatory Ukrainian slang for Russians - JA]. Another great Ukrainian 'victory,' I suppose. 
*** 
As can be seen, life in the Donetsk People's Republic is complex and not familiar to those who have never lived in a war zone, but it is far from the nightmares described in the Ukrainian media. Local people have learned to live in new conditions in 2 years (even if they haven't gotten used to it, as you just can't) and have tried to build the best life possible in every sphere in the republic. 

Patience, love for one's native land, and dedication allow people not merely to survive, but to live with dignity despite all the difficulties and problems in the DPR. And there are certainly enough of them, over which people have accumulated more than a few complaints and questions for the local government and the situation overall.

The US Federal Bureau of Investigation has directly pressured Russian diplomats and forbid them from being near voting places during the presidential elections in the United States on November 8th. Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman of the Russian foreign ministry, wrote about this on her Facebook page on Monday. 
'It's come to openly intimidating the staff of diplomatic agencies. The State Department recommended Russian representatives in a memo 'not to come to polling stations on their own', and some states' authorities have gone even further and threatened criminal prosecution. This means that they can't even watch the voting procedure,' Zakharova wrote. 
According to Zakharova, in recent days, direct pressure has been put on Russian representatives in the United States by the FBI, 'whose agents, with undisguised threats, have let us know that we should not be interested in the American elections.' 
'In Houston, in order to offer such a 'warning,' a Hollywood-style special operation was arranged that blocked the car of our Consulate General's employees on the street. They stopped the car and started to 'convince' them that they should not watch the voting, and not even think about it,' Zakharova added. 

In connection with the incident with the Russian embassy in Washington, a relevant submission has already been made to the State Department.  
'But the question arises: what can a foreign diplomat see at American polling stations that is so important that they've brought in 'Mr. Smith', and why are election monitoring procedures controlled by the FBI?!', the Russian foreign ministry's representative concluded.

One of the symbols of the 'new Ukraine', the ex-Georgian president, fugitive, and part-time governor of Odessa, Mikhail Saakashvili, has announced his resignation, which came as a shock and to the dismay of Ukrainian citizens, who for some reason had great political hopes for him. I'll leave aside the discussion of how Saakashvili's biography, character, and addiction to hard narcotics couldn't possibly leave anything good to be expected from him. What is more interesting to discuss are the motives behind his resignation and explaining whether this is connected to the American elections.  
Before delving into this, let's immediately eliminate two entirely untenable theories which nevertheless have a number of supporters on social networks.  
Untenable theory number one is that Saakashvili has some kind of insider information that the US elections will be won by Hillary Clinton, and that he was warned in advance to secure a good starting position in the new American leadership's Ukraine strategy. I understand the appeal of this theory, but I can't agree with it. Saakashvili can hope that Clinton will win, and he can pray for her victory, but he cannot know the results of the US elections or possess any top insider secrets. For those who doubt this, let me remind you of two episodes. 
The first episode was in 2008, when Saakashvili was 100% sure that America would completely sign up to back him against Russia. Well, how did that 'insider knowledge' work out? 
The second episode was just recently, in this year, when he spoke of his future triumphant return to Georgia, apparently hoping that the Americans would falsify the results of the Georgian parliamentary elections in favor of his party. The Americans could have done this, but they didn't. His party lost the elections by a landslide. 
Thus, the image of Saakashvili as a super insider can be very appealing, but it does not correspond to reality. 
The second untenable theory is that Saakashvili left for internal Ukrainian reasons or was forced to leave by 'disgruntled Odessans.' Contemporary Ukraine is a territory full of national injustice. Local, regional, and national authorities couldn't care less about dissatisfied citizens, whether in Odessa, Kiev, Zaporozhya, and so on. They also don't care about their approval ratings. Saakashvili was given Odessa to 'eat up,' and the people who took this decision to quarter a US mercenary in Ukraine are clearly not the ones sitting in Kiev.  
Given this, it can be supposed that the version that the former Georgian president, famous for his greed, left his post because of tensions within Ukraine is in the least a strange theory. 
And now about Saakashvili's gesture. Apparently, he really needed to officially distance himself from Poroshenko who, from the point of view of many Western experts, has fulfilled almost all of the tasks in Ukraine that he was given. Even better was Saakashvili putting the emphasis on conflict with Poroshenko.  
The new US president, whoever it will be, will be forced to do something with this situation, and the fact is not too far off that the decision will be made to do some behind-the-scenes spanking. 
The scenario of backstage spanking, reducing salaries, and rinsing dirty laundry in the media is the best thing that could happen to Poroshenko under any new American administration. 
Saakashvili is pretending that he has nothing at all to do with what has and is happening in Ukraine. For him, it would be ideal if Washington believed that he has no relation to Poroshenko, doesn't know Kolomoysky, and has never seen Yatsenyuk, but had instead been somehow dragged into the mess created by the US' political puppets in Ukraine. 
Under these circumstances, distancing himself is a good strategy, but Saakashvili has run into an obstacle. He should have distanced himself earlier. Now this trick might not work. 
The former Georgian president is now demonstrating a kind of behavior which is really familiar in Russia and which is difficult to be misconstrued. What does a regional official who has thieved or failed at an important project do when he learns that a check up is soon coming from Moscow? The pattern of behavior has not changed since the times of the USSR, believe me. This official immediately flies to the capital and tries to, so to say, resolve issues in a small circle of interested associates. Saakashvili and his team have failed in two spheres of work, the Georgian and Ukrainian ones. In Georgia, he lost elections, and in Ukraine he failed to create a success story out of Odessa. The Americans needed such success stories and Saakashvili 100% promised them something of the sort.  
Now Saakashvili is covering his weak spots and unleashing into the information field the theory that he failed as governor only because of corrupt Kiev and interference by Poroshenko himself and his entourage. 
Surely, Saakashvili has already written something in this spirit to Washington and is now simply publicly confirming his position and line of defense. If he gains the nerve, then he could try to ask the new US administration (and he has friends among both the Republicans and the Democrats) for a promotion, to let him steer something in Kiev, or participate in a new political project in Ukraine. 
Considering that the Americans love to arrange political shows in which some political puppets are replaced by other political puppets under cries of fighting against corruption, then this might just work out for him. 
Saakashvili's actions are a very bad sign for Poroshenko. Poroshenko has no good way out of the unfolding situation. It may very well be that he has been left with only two paths: one to Rostov and the other to the gallows. 
Saakashvili's actions are also a possible sign that the Americans will radically shake up the Ukrainian political elite and bring real freaks and misfits to the forefront. For us, this is more good than bad. Any sudden movements could finish off the government system in Ukraine and lead to the delegitimization of the regime in Kiev, especially if outright Nazis come to power there. 

For us, this collapse of the administrative system and the delegitimization of the government in Ukraine is good, even if Saakashvili earns something out of this.

November 9, 2016 - Fort Russ -  RT - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


On November 8th, Republican candidate Donald Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States. The results of the elections are still being summed up, but Trump has the undisputed advantage in electoral votes - 279 against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's 218 - and has therefore practically won.  
Russian political circles are displaying a cautious attitude towards Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential elections. Politicians interviewed by RT expect that Russia and America will build more constructive relations, but no warming should be counted on. Russian deputies and senators have noted that they are awaiting a 'competent' reaction by Trump to Syria, Crimea, and Ukraine. 
The deputy chairman of the Federation Council's Committee on International Affairs, Arsen Kanokov, expects Trump to find a common language with Vladimir Putin and Russia overall. The senator said: 'There is great hope for a thaw. We all want to have friendly relations with America. The question is how these processes are happening. I think that we will sit at the negotiating table and Russia's reasonable voice will be heard by America. We hope that they will understand the actions and aid that we are affording to Syria. The political vector will change in this regard.' 
The first deputy chairwoman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, Svetlana Zhurova, recalled that Donald Trump repeatedly spoke of the need for cooperation with Russia even during his election campaign.  
Zhurova believes: 'This does not mean that tomorrow Trump will rush to Russia to meet with Vladimir Putin or that our representatives will rush to America to negotiate with him. They will work out orderly, constructive relations. Trump will pay more attention to internal problems rather than the showdown between the two countries. He believes that America should pay attention to economic cooperation with Russia, political dialogue, and the joint struggle against global terrorism. In these spheres, our countries can truly be useful for each other. Trump spoke about all of this in his campaign speeches. He is not the kind of person who breaks his word. Yes, Trump will look to the opinion of the US population, which has some doubts concerning Russia, but there won't be such aggression in policies towards Russia like the Obama administration did.' 
Dmitry Novikov, also a member of the State Duma's international committee, suggests that no radical changes in the US' foreign policy course should be expected.  
'Trump has been elected president of his country, so he will undoubtedly defend the interests of the US and its ruling circles. If Trump will fulfill his promises on how the administration in Washington should focus on solving domestic problems, then maybe his foreign policy won't be so aggressive. As for what concerns Russia, more common sense approaches to such issues as Syria, Crimea, and Ukraine might prevail in the White House's policies. In these cases, the preconditions for the normalization of relations between Russia and the United States could be expressed,' Novikov posited. 
Novikov also added that no warming of relations like in the days of Kennedy and Khrushchev should be expected, since Russia's geopolitical position has dramatically changed.  
'The Soviet Union had much more formidable starting capabilities to be on an equal footing in the world arena. The country had economic weight and a system of alliances. In this sense, modern Russia has a somewhat weaker position. Nevertheless, the US has enough domestic problems, and if Trump really zeros in on solving them, then we could see more reasonable foreign policy,' he added. 
In turn, the first deputy chairman of the Federation Council's Committee on International Affairs, Vladimir Dzhabarov, believes that Trump's victory will positively impact Russian-American relations. According to him: 'One shouldn't wait for any dramatic warming [in relations], or worsening, for that matter, which was expected if Hillary won.' Dzhabarov remarked that Trump, during his election campaign, behaved with dignity and did not spew out any negative statements towards Russia and the Russian president. 

The politician also expressed hope that the billionaire's victory would affect Europe's position on relations with Russia: 'No wonder they have taken a cautious position on sanctions. I hope that they will become more independent,' Dzhabarov said.

Will the anti-Clinton revolt among American elites gain momentum? November 7, 2016 - Fort Russ Mikhail Khazin , one of the top Russian economists- Translated from Russian by Kristina Kharlova There are rumors of revolt in the US state apparatus in the broad sense of the word against Hillary Clinton. Note that the top layer of the US establishment still supports Clinton, squashing any signs of disobedience: FBI closes cases, newspapers stop printing nasty things about her and so on. But one way or the other the issue floats to the surface. One of the likely reasons for this, is that Hillary Clinton is actively trading the national sovereignty of the United States in the framework of the activities of her foundation. In other words, American patriots consider her a traitor. And, as it turned out, this factor may play a decisive role. Previously it was not so obvious. In particular, the latest issue '” the sale by Lockheed Martin to Turkey of a few dozen fighters of the fifth generation. Clinton is an old lobbyist for this company, so there is no doubt that it's her achievement. The problem is that Turkey under the current circumstances may cease to be a US ally, and no one can guarantee that these fighters do not fall into the hands of potential adversaries. For this reason, I do not exclude that these actions led to the resumption of the case against Clinton by the FBI. The results of tomorrow's elections remain unclear. But one thing is for sure: there are many people in the US who do not advertise their fondness of Trump, but in reality are ready to support him in the election. That is why the result of the vote may be surprising. Follow us on Facebook!

During an ongoing press conference in Donetsk, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, revealed the names of two Ukrainian officials involved in the organization of the attack which killed Hero of the Republic Arsen Pavlov (Motorola).  
'I am ready to name those involved in the murder of Motorola. According to our intelligence, Vitaly Malikov, who advised sabotage and terrorist activity in Donbass, the head of the Donetsk region SBU, Akut, and a number of responsible employees and representatives of the SBU headquarters participated in preparing and committing this crime,' the head of the DPR stated. 
Zakharchenko added that the republic's criminal investigators already have the full list of persons involved in the organization of this crime, but the DPR is not yet going to name all the names. In addition, the identity of the exact persons who committed the terrorist act are being determined. 
Zakharchenko emphasized: 'I assure you that these names will be determined, that these people will be found and, at the request of the father of Motorola's bodyguard, will be give these names to Abkhazia as well.' 

On October 16th, Motorola, the commander of the Sparta battalion and a colonel of the DPR army, was killed by an explosive device set up by Ukrainian saboteurs in the elevator in his apartment building. Motorola's bodyguard was also killed. The authorities of the DPR have qualified the crime as a terrorist attack.

Crimean leader Sergey Aksenov welcomed the choice of the American people in the US presidential elections despite what he called 'numerous' violations in the electoral process. 
Aksenov stated: 'The American people have made their choice. Our president was clear: the Russian Federation is not interfering in or even making any attempts to influence the will of the American people. In my opinion, the elections were held with numerous violations. If this had happened in Crimea or Russia, then the elections would have been assessed differently by American politicians. They would say that everything was wrong and illegitimate. But the Americans did not allow Russian diplomats near polling stations and prevented the formation of an objective view of what was happening at polling stations and overall how the elections were being held in the US.' 
Commenting on Trump's pre-election promises in regards to Russia and the Republic of Crimea, Aksenov said: 'Before elections, politicians usually make some statements, and then their program can radically change. Time will tell. I am sure that our president will make sufficient efforts so that Crimea will be recognized throughout the world.' 
This summer, Trump stated that he would be ready to 'look into' the question of recognizing Crimea as Russian territory and lifting the sanctions against Russia if he won the elections. He remarked that Crimeans want to be with Russia and that this should be considered by the international community. These words caused great anxiety in Kiev. 

The leader of the Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, was cautious in being optimistic towards Trump's election as US president. Zakharchenko expressed concern that after Trump moves into the White House, he will become part of the American political system and there is no guarantee that he will be able to resist this system. For the DPR, Trump's suggested policies could signal a change in attitude towards the Ukrainian crisis.

Among the epithets sprinkled on the Republican candidate and new US President were 'dangerous marginal," "complete idiot," and 'clown.' If Arseniy Yatsenyuk, having already left Ukrainian Olympus, might not threatened by the consequences of destructively criticizing the new US president, then the acting head of Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov, will have to explain the words he wrote on Facebook as well as the accompanying picture. "US presidential candidate Trump's shameless statement on the possibility of recognizing Crimea as Russian is a diagnosis of a dangerous marginal. He is just as dangerous for Ukraine as he is for the US. A marginal indulging Putin's dictatorship cannot be a guarantor of democratic freedoms in the US and the world..No wonder Manafort earlier headed Yanukovych's headquarters, and now Trump's. Yanukovich fled to Russia through Crimea. Where will Manafort take Trump? #Trumpisours" Besides the ex-prime minister and head of the Ukrainian interior ministry, deputies of the Verkhovna Rada, diplomats, and other officials have bad mouthed Trump. Ukraine's ambassador to the UN, Yuri Sergeev, called the newly elected US president a clown. "Apparently, the clown Trump has gone off the rails on his tour. He is a greater danger to the US than terrorism." The Kiev-based political analyst Kost Bondarenko sarcastically advised everyone insulting Trump to look at the experience of the French press writing about Napoleon Bonaparte depending on when he won or not. 'Trump's victory reminds me of a classic anecdote from the early 19th century.

On November 9th, despite the overwhelming majority of forecasts, the eccentric billionaire Donald Trump won the US presidential elections, not the favorite of the American elites, Hillary Clinton.  
But Trump's joy is not shared by everyone. Many American citizens don't consider him to be their president. A wave of demonstrations and protests has swept across America which are becoming stronger with each passing day. Today, November 11th, it was reported that a petition to the electors to recognize Hillary Clinton's victory has already gathered 2 million signatures (over two, not even whole days!)  
The situation unfolding today in the US is in some of its features reminiscent of the situation n Ukraine during the first 'Orange Revolution' of 2004. Ukraine was split into two camps along geographic lines: the South and East were for the winner of the second round of elections, Viktor Yanukovych, and the West and Center were for Viktor Yushchenko, the leader of the liberal opposition. Of course, this comparison might be somewhat arbitrary, but what ties together the present situation in the US and Ukraine in 2004 is that Ukrainian and American society turned out to be split.  
In the US, according to published statistics, 70% of the white population voted for Donald Trump along with most Protestants and slightly more than half of Catholics. For Hillary Clinton voted racial minorities - 88% of African Americans and 65% of people of Latin American origin. Clinton was also supported by religious minorities, such as Jews, Muslims, and atheists, sexual minorities, and supporters of 'cultural revolution,' i.e., the intelligentsia living in the big cities. This is at least how the picture looks from Russia.  
I will posit that Yanukovych's victory in the second round of elections and Trump's victory divided their nations insofar as the elections were polarized along the positions of citizens (whether geographical, racial, or cultural). The second, losing half of the population felt deceived and betrayed. In Ukraine, the situation was then transformed into the exact opposite: as a result of an unconstitutional 'third round' of elections, the president's victory was handed over to Western Ukraine's candidate, Yushchenko. Then it was the South and East that felt betrayed.  
Larger and larger masses of people in the US are protesting. I think that these protests will subside and won't lead to anything big.  But the cultural-civilizational and racial split, not receiving any political solution, will only become deeper and create the basis for a genuine split of the nation. Something similar already happened in US history, when there was the split into the Federalist North and Confederate South. But now the situation seems much more complex and the contradictions are far more varied and not restricted to geographical borders. 
Ironically, the first signs of a color revolution can be observed in the US - in the likes of all of such that the US has engineered in different countries. On social networks, the hashtag #Calexit is gaining popularity among California residents. This is a call to proclaim the independence of California and its secession from the US by analogy with Brexit in the UK. 
Individual states in the US have talked about separatism before, but only now is separatism gaining a broad social basis after the presidential elections split American society into two maps: the white population, and racial and religious minorities including the supporters of multiculturalism. 
But what has particularly struck me personally in the current situation surrounding the elections results is the reaction to Trump's victory among EU leaders. It is a paradox that such a junior partner (if not vassal) of the US, the European Union, dares to criticize the will of the American people, and even support protests against Trump, i.e., a potential color revolution in the US! One Russian newspaper quoted an anonymous member of the European Parliament according to whom the destructive effect of the outcome of the elections has 10 times surpassed the aftermath of the referendum on Great Britain's exit from the EU. Judging by everything, this is not only the personal opinion of one European MEP. This is the assessment of the overwhelming majority of the European political mainstream. 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, who perhaps might be the future Chancellor of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, has urged the EU to prepare for Trump's 'unpredictable' foreign policy. The head of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, did not refrain from expressing himself when he compared Trump's victory to Brexit. In his opinion, people turn to "protest voting" when they are not taken seriously. Thus, one of the leaders of the European Union supports a color revolution in the US! 

Multicultural Europe is standing in support of the multicultural US. How far will the protests in America go and how far will European politicians go in supporting a color revolution in the US? In my opinion, the process is much more important than the result. The country is split, just like the Western elites themselves'¦

The Federal Security Service (FSB) of Russia has published footage of the arrest of saboteurs from the Ukrainian defense ministry in Sevastopol. 
As reported earlier, a saboteur-terrorist group from the Ukrainian ministry of defense planning terrorist attacks on military targets in Crimea was arrested in Sevastopol.  A source from Russian security agencies told Interfax: 'All three of the arrested are citizens of Ukraine. They are suspected of preparing acts of sabotage on the peninsula.'   

'Russian law enforcement had operative information on saboteurs' infiltration of the peninsula around two weeks ago. Tight surveillance followed them to identify their contacts, routines of travel and communication, and the operation contributed to the identification of informants on the peninsula. In this regard, new arrests are not ruled out,' he added.  
It is now known that the detainees in Sevastopol were staff officers of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. They pleaded guilty and offered confessions. 
During the search of their apartments, a map was discovered with marked military facilities and infrastructure targets on the Crimean peninsula. The source added that 'considering the interrogations of those arrested, it has been established that they were preparing acts of sabotage against power plants, water purification plants, and also gas distribution networks in Crimea.'  

The video footage shows the capture of one of the Ukrainian terrorists and the search of his apartment, where FSB officers found weapons and ammunition. The clip also shows security forces recovered a package, presumably of explosives, from an underground safe.

Neyromir TV (Video)  - Valentin Katasonov - Translated from Russian by Kristina Kharlova 


The heated discussion in the media is a diversion - focused on marginal issues appealing to emotions, while much graver issues that are at stake are hidden behind the scenes, explains Valentin Katasonov, p rofessor, associate member of the Russian Academy of Economic Science and Business. 




Part 1 (00.00-14.00) 





V.K: Trump understands the situation. I didn't expect him to be so open about revealing all the ills. He is revealing many of the secrets. This is better for America - to face the diagnosis, than to conceal it from  the patient.  

As you know interest rates in the countries of the Golden billion are below the floor.  Last year when interest rates were slightly raised, this caused serious consequences . Christine Lagarde appealed to stop or the global economy will crash. They did not raise interest rates again as planned. Not in the first or the second quarter. They are in a very difficult situation. Trump said if interest rates are raised America will default, because most of the budget will go to pay for interest rates.  

Trump probably wants to save capitalism, but capitalism without interest rates is nonsense. Trump  is a defender of capitalism. 

Host: Who is Hillary Clinton? 

V.K.: She doesn't say who she is, she is focused on some marginal subjects, like rights of minorities or climate change. We understand that these are silly games. 

Host: But climate change is real? 

V.K.: You know I was involved in this as part of World Bank and I know their schemes. Although there might be something going on, I can assure that they don't really care about it.  

Host: What about the ruble? 

V.K. It depends when this apocalypse will take place. The dropping of the ruble is part of the plan of the occupation. 

Only God knows when this apocalypse will happen, may be not next week, could be few months of years for sure, because all the resources have been exhausted. Trump senses this very well, and he wants to save capitalism and America, and for this he wants to negotiate with the lenders and restructure American debt. In reality America is working on new technologies which don't require any negotiations, I am taking about Iran. As you know in the beginning of 2o16 Uncle Sam said we are finally cancelling sanctions and unfreeze Iran's foreign assets. 

There are many conditions, some things are written down. Iran is not happy that America is writing off $2 billion to cover losses from terrorist act in Lebanon in 1983. I looked at some documents, Iran had nothing to do with it, but Uncle Sam found them guilty, just like those in 9/11. It turns out the culprit was Saudi Arabia.  

Host: But Saudi Arabia threatened to sell treasuries and was taken off the list of culprits? 

V.K. Who will let them sell it? Treasuries are in the depositories, it's a double key system, Saudi Arabia has one key and Uncle Sam has another key 

Host: Why is Russia buying these treasuries while in a crisis? We did mention this is a levy, but if we don't develop our industry and science nothing will help us? 

V.K. You know some of our elites hope they have an second base in the USA, the 'unsinkable'. We know some people have already set up base there, like the first deputy minister of finance. Some are closer, like the former minister of agriculture is in France. It is easier to count those who did not leave. This shows we are dealing with colonial administration which receives basic guarantees for citizenship in the US, France, GB. 

Host: Their policies lead to total collapse, what if the owners are not happy? 

V.K.: You know, lets not overestimate the masters, they act as parasites. Parsites keep feeding not thinking that the food will run out and they may also perish. They don't see beyond their nose. 

Speaking of Iran, according to Iran, their foreign reserves comprise $130 billion, according to US - $100 billion, half of them are gold and currency reserves belonging to Iran's Central bank, or the Sovereign fund of Iran. I think they will eat up these 130 billion very fast, because after the $2 billion, US announced they will demand $11.5 billion for 9/11. The appetite comes during the meal. The Iranian parliament discussed a bill to allow the government to begin a case about damages to Iran by USA. A working group will inventory all the events and estimate them.  

Today the world is entering a repatriation game, this is a commercialization of international relations and monetizing of our history. This is very important to Russian Federation. Baltic countries continue to work on such demands, especially Latvia. Ukraine is a little different. While the Baltics refer to Soviet occupation, Ukraine is talking about Crimea. Monetizing losses from events in Donbass and so on. I am just saying we should be a step ahead, we must prepare the same contra-measures.

November 12, 2016 - Fort Russ -  Viktor Pirozhenko, Izvestiya - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


On her Facebook page, Verkhovna Rada deputy Nadezhda Savchenko urged future US President Donald Trump to maintain and strengthen sanctions against Russia. In fact, she foreshadowed similar, official calls of the sort from Kiev to the new US administration.  
Such calls will necessarily follow insofar as the entire foreign policy of the Kiev regime is based on simple-minded and destructive assumptions: lobbying the West for extending anti-Russian sanctions and begging for aid and loans.  
However, likely changes in US foreign policy under Trump, including in relations with the Kiev regime, as well as internal political processes in Ukraine itself could seriously change both the relationship between Kiev and Washington and the balance of political forces within the Kiev regime.  
Overall, the situation in Ukraine is developing in the direction of early parliamentary elections with the possibility of nominating the now former head of the Odessa regional administration, Mikhail Saakashvili, for president in 2019. 
The US itself long ago formulated the clear demand for a new, distinctly pro-American oriented political force that could replace the Maidan politicians of the first wave. Washington, in the face of the departing Obama Administration, has finally refused to trust Poroshenko, Yatsenyuk, Avakov, and their entourage. 
Donald Trump, on the basis of his foreign policy ideas, will most likely significantly reduce the US' active participation in ideologically-driven foreign policy actions like the Obama Administration's policy in Ukraine.  
During his election campaign, Trump promised to transition US foreign policy to "breaking even" and threatened to stimulate America's European allies to take greater responsibility for Ukraine upon themselves.  
In this situation, the number of those in Ukraine who want to show that replacing the corrupt government of Poroshenko and the People's Front with a new pro-American government will allow the West to economize on aid to Ukraine is increasing. Trump's foreign policy positions paradoxically give Saakashvili and the pro-American groups oriented towards him in Kiev an additional argument for the new administration and a powerful lever of pressure on Poroshenko and his entourage. We will soon see how Trump will react to these arguments. 
In addition to Saakashvili and his Volna ("Wave") party, the 'Leshchenko-Nayem group' is trying to become the new pro-Western bet in Ukraine. This group makes up the core of the Democratic Alliance party and a large mass of the pro-Western oriented public opinion leaders and influential officials in Kiev and in the regions. 
Washington's unwillingness to destabilize the overall socio-political situation in Ukraine to such an extent that it would spin out of the US' control is, like before, hindering the Americans from removing Poroshenko from the post of president. Poroshenko remains, but in such a situation, the role and importance of those pro-American oriented political forces who will start keeping a close eye on the corrupt team of the head of the Kiev regime will only grow. 
Washington's claims against Kiev, duplicated by the American column in Ukraine, concern the lack of professionalism in the state administration, the indulgence of corruption, the use of grey financial schemes in the economy, robbing the budget, the misuse of foreign loans, etc.  
At the present moment, the anti-Poroshenko and pro-American forces in Ukrainian politics remain fragmented, but they now understand the necessity of unifying.  
The problem is that the 'young reformers' that the Obama Administrated hedged its bets in Ukraine on, just like the third pro-American forces (besides the Poroshenko Bloc and People's Front) have turned out to be at loggerheads with the future US president, Trump.  
Deputies Sergey Leshchenko and Mustafa Nayem are favorites of Joe Biden and Victoria Nuland who openly played along with Hillary Clinton's election campaign. Leshchenko personally initiated the "off-the-books" scandal with the Party of Regions which forced Paul Manafort, the head of Trump's election headquarters, to leave his post. The only chance for them now is to escape to Saakashvili's patronage, who will be the only one in the Kiev regime that didn't play in any anti-Trump campaign. 
Saakashvilli and his party, just like the Democratic Alliance, Yulia Tymoshenko's Fatherland party, and the Opposition Bloc, are interested in early parliamentary elections and are likely to promote them. Saakashvili's resignation, urgent party building, and the convulsive social and political activity of Poroshenko's opponents show that no one in the opposition wants to wait until 2019. And so, a congress of the Democratic Alliance party is being prepared which will finally determine a program and elect a leadership. Someone is also trying to organize Volna.  
Whether the Trump Administration will give a green light to early parliamentary elections is unknown. However, Poroshenko's competitors are obviously counting on their activism to influence the Trump Administration's position and put the need to support such choices in front of it.  

In one way or another, some of Poroshenko's competitors have perceived the change of government in the US not only as a challenge, but as a window of opportunity for themselves. Taking into account this factor, the development of events in Ukraine increases the likelihood of a change in the balance of political forces and early parliamentary elections.

How Donald Trump is already indirectly helping Russia and Syria November 11, 2016 - Fort Russ - Ruslan Ostashko, PolitRussia - translated by J. Arnoldski - Perhaps the most famous media project of Donald Trump is the reality show 'The Apprentice' on NBC, in which Trump played himself and subjected people wanting to work in his business to various tests. Trump not only played the lead role in the show, but also successfully produced it, which proves that he can not only built hotels, but also very well understands modern show business. This also shows how his opponents greatly underestimated him during the presidential race. Before Trump launched his presidential slogan 'Make America Great Again,' in the public's mind he was already associated with another catchphrase: 'You're fired!', which he yelled at the careless participants of his TV show. Some American commentators have even written that voters might have voted for him just to see whether he would dress down Washington officials in the same way he did on TV. So far, at least in front of cameras, Trump is behaving relatively restrained, especially since he has no official rights yet. But the press is already leaking information about what he is doing behind closed doors. For example, USA Today , a newspaper which is very skeptical towards the new president, reports that Trump's first victims are Pentagon generals. He has set before them the unspoken task of working out a plan for mass, effective airstrikes on ISIS. The due date is in 30 days and will have unpredictable, negative consequences for those generals who will not fulfill the order or will handle it poorly. The sources of American journalists are even complaining that these generals could be forced to - get ready - cooperate with Russia and even share information with the Russian air force, something which for many senior US commanders is worse than having to shred their insignia. Now let me explain why this plan for 'massive bombardments against ISIS' is important. Remember what our diplomats and officers constantly say about the US' actions - the Americans have only been supposedly bombing ISIS for several years, and the number of flights is scanty and their successes feature, for example, only two killed ISIS leaders. It is clear these bombardments were carried out in such a way so as to not harm the terrorist groups sponsored by Qatar and Saudi Arabia and those groups whom Clinton considered to be the main tool in the fight against Assad. And now it turns out that Trump is already going to force the American military machine, under threat of dismissals, to really bomb their yesterday allies. Obama has oriented himself in this situation best of all, since he might need to be given a consolation prize for being the most quirky American politician. After three years of inactivity and after his peace deal with Putin that Clinton's supporters (the same 'forces in Washington' that Putin spoke about at Valdai) tore up, the departing American president has decided to indulge this opportunity to the fullest. Here's what American media are writing today. The Washington Post , citing senior officials in the outgoing administration, writes that Barack Obama has ordered to find and destroy leaders of the terrorist group Jebhat Al-Nusra. Although it is better to wait for official statements, it can be assumed that this information is accurate since the Washington Post is a newspaper with good sources in the US Democratic Party. Why does Obama need to do this? First of all, this is an opportunity to complete what he was not allowed to do a few months ago. Secondly, this is an opportunity to leave the White House with an image of a great fighter against terrorism. Remember how Hillary Clinton virtually claimed for herself the laurels as the 'killer of Bin Laden'? Now the outgoing president has the opportunity to level the score and, if lucky, deprive Trump of the ability to win the laurels for being an active fighter against terrorism and the first to start really bombing ISIS. Here it needs to be said that everyone can understand the consequences of these decisions without resorting to any conspiracies. For example, The Washington Post 's last issue was published with the headline: 'Obama directs Pentagon to target al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, one of the most formidable forces fighting Assad.' Translated from journalistic lingo into common speech, this sounds like 'Help! Obama has decided to whack our main allies and reconsidered removing Assad!' Amazing. Trump hasn't even taken office yet, but there are already encouraging changes in how American politicians and the military are acting. Some simply don't want Trump's catchphrase 'You're fired!' thrown in their faces, while others are simply trying to solve their own problems. But no matter what, this all suits us. One thing is already clear: life will be difficult for Assad and Russia's enemies in Syria when the Russian combat group approaching the coast of Syria begins its work. It will be quite difficult for them. Now they can only hope for a miracle. Follow us on Facebook!

Poroshenko apologizes to Lukashenko for threat to shoot down civilian plane November 11, 2016 - Fort Russ News - PolitRussia - translated by J. Arnoldski - Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has apologized to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko for the incident with the civilian Belavia airliner . During a telephone conversation, the Ukrainian leader also informed Poroshenko that the perpetrators of the incident will be punished. The two heads of state agreed that their countries' relevant services will soon hold consultations on security issues to prevent such incidents in the future. On October 21st, a Belavia civilian flight was forced to return to the Zhulyany airport near Kiev after being threatened by Ukrainian fighter jets. After landing, the SBU detained one of its passengers, the chairman of the board of the Civil Union international public organization, Armen Martirosyan, who was soon after released. Minsk expressed its protest against the incident to Kiev. A memo sent to Kiev said 'the Belarusian side expects an official apology and demands compensation for all losses and expenses caused by the Ukrainian side's actions.' Ukraine's security services initially denied that fighter jets threatened the civilian plane, but the Belarusian side published the transcript of the conversation between the crew commander and dispatcher. Afterwards, Belavia reported that Ukraine agreed to pay 'small compensation' for the incident. The passenger over whom Kiev landed the plane has filed a lawsuit against Ukrainian authorities.

6 neo-Nazis arrested in Motorola assassination case, SBU plot exposed November 12, 2016 - Fort Russ News - RusVesna - translated by J. Arnoldski - The Ministry of State Security (MGB) of the Donetsk People's Republic has announced the arrest of six neo-Nazis from Misanthropic Division, whose leaders earlier claimed responsibility for the murder of Sparta battalion commander Arsen Pavlov (Motorola). The counter-espionage department of the ministry has reported that those arrested have already given confessions and evidence of the 'circumstances of the committing of such a terroristic and extremist crime.' The neo-Nazis had maintained contact with employees of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and operated on the territory of the DPR in its interests. 'It has been established that all terrorist and subversive actions in the DPR and LPR are carried out by the SBU in the framework of an approved operational plan, the purpose of which is to intensify internal contradictions between the leaders of the Donbass republics, creating the preconditions and circumstances for confrontation between them,' the Ministry of State Security emphasized, adding that the detainees are being further investigated.

Scandalous Poll: 84% of Ukrainians want Putin as their president November 13, 2016 - Fort Russ - Zavtra - translated by J. Arnoldski - The Ukrainian publication Nedelya.UA conducted a poll among its readers asking the following question: 'Which politician would you entrust with the governance of your country?' The survey was participated in by 41,600 readers and showed the following figures: 84% (34,900) of Ukrainian respondents want to see Vladimir Putin as president of Ukraine. In second place with 5% (2,000) was Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Third place with 2% (820) was claimed by Xi Jinping and fourth, also with 2% (708) was leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky. The current president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, took 5th place with only 1% (538 votes). Further down the list were German Chancellor Angela Merkel (1%, 430 votes), the chairman of the French National Front Marine Le Pen (1%, 426 votes), Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev (1%, 318), and US President Barack Obama (1%, 244 votes). Notably enough, former Georgian president and until recently head of the Odessa region, Mikhail Saakashvili, was not included on the list. According to doctor of economic sciences and director of the Institute for Problems of Globalization, Mikhail Delyakin, the results are not representative. The expert remarked: 'Without a doubt, the figures are unrepresentative: not only Ukrainians could take part in the voting, and the audience of the site speaks Russian - there is no Ukrainian version. At the same time, it is hardly likely, for example, that the Russian readers of this Ukrainian site are supporters of Putin. They are most likely fans of Bandera.' 'On the other hand, the main part of Ukraine (including Banderites) speaks Russian, not Ukrainian. This was exposed by Guinness, which conducted an innocent poll on the quality of vegetables and allowed respondents to choose between surveys in Ukrainian or Russian. 77% chose Russian. Since then, this share has declined, but it is still clearly more than half even taking into account the departure of Crimea, the DPR and LPR, and the fact that most educated and cultured, i.e., Russian-speaking Ukrainians have fled to every corner, and mainly Russia, from this 'victorious democracy' and the European Nazi course,' Delyagin pointed out. 'Nevertheless, it might be that overall these figures reflect the real mood of those Ukrainians who have been brutalized by the complete nobody thieves and killers imposed upon them by the West as their leaders. For the same motives, the most respected political leader in Russia is Stalin. Respect for Putin even sometimes appears among Russophobes who think: 'With such a leader, we would have long ago defeated those Moskals,' Delyagin continued. The economist concluded with the following commentary: 'Of course, this does not mean that the destructive liberal socio-economic policies pursued in Russia by appointees like Medvedev and Navulinnaya are correct. However, against the general backdrop of the nobody leaders of the modern West and its satellites, Putin is really a symbol of reason and hope for a better future for all of humanity, not the rapidly dwindling 'Golden Billion.''

Fabrizio Poggi, in  Contropiano , translated from Italian by Tom Winter 

Igor Dodon, President-elect of Moldova 
Moldova and Bulgaria: Something new in the East 
Rumen Radev, President-elect of Bulgaria 
In the east - not everywhere, sadly - there is a turn towards Moscow. The newly elected presidents of Moldavia and Bulgaria seem to want to go in that direction. 

In Kishinev, where two weeks ago, no candidate had a majority in round one, the Socialist Party leader, Igor Dodon, has 52.6% of the votes (not including expatriate votes from US and Canada, but these can not overturn the result) against the pro-EU Maia Sandu, leader of the Action and Solidarity Party, with 47.3% and who, in Yankee fashion, is now threatening "mass demonstrations," not recognizing the result. 
Maia Sandu  Dodon congratulated Sandu for the "honorable result" and invited her to discussions, without destabilizing the country. It seems (though not official at this time of writing) that the turnout was respectable; this was the first direct election of the president of the republic since 1996; since 2000 in fact, the President was elected by Parliament. There was even shortage of ballots, in particular in various stations abroad: Bologna, Parma, Paris, Moscow, Bucharest; Portugal appears to have lost the entire st of ballots. 

On the eve of the vote Dodon, an experienced office-holder, (Deputy Prime Minister in 2008-2009 and Minister of Economy in 2006-2009) said that if he won, his first visit abroad would would be to Moscow, "to start working out a strategic partnership agreement" and to renew exports to Russia, which were limited after the signing of the association and free trade agreement with the EU.  

Dodon has always said he was "confident of victory. People are tired of the seven years of EU coalition, poverty, corruption, lawlessness, and want to live in a state of their own and not in some province of another country."  

The socialist leader has also called for the Russian peacekeepers to remain in Transnistria, until the complete solution of the political events through the federalization of Moldova, which Sandu opposes. According to Tass, all candidates had based their election campaign primarily on foreign issues: pointing on one side to the "hand of the Kremlin," and, on the other to "Washington's Regional Committee,"  a side which was still floating a union with Romania. The Socialists pointed to Maia Sandu as "a puppet of the US" - where she studied and worked at the World Bank, and tied her to Angela Merkel, Donald Tusk, and Jean-Claude Juncker, apparently even to former Romanian President, Traian BÄƒsescu, who got himself awarded Moldovan citizenship [! -tr] in order to vote for Maia Sandu.  

On the other side Sandu was proposing, along with strategic partnership with Washington, close contacts with Kiev, even a future union with Romania. 

As expected, there are the threats of yet another "Orange Revolution," like the one in 2009 after the Communist Party won the election in Moldova, under the flags of EU and Romania, with rioting which brought broken windows and arson to the Parliament and the presidential residence.  

Obviously, Brussels was on the "orange" side: the results of seven years of EU-line coalition are also seen in the demonstrations a year ago against the oligarchy in power, in the rejection of government policy on the part of 80% of the population, and in those favoring integration with Brussels falling from 70% to 37%.  

In addition, the Donald Trump victory seems to have played a role also in Kishinev: "The geopolitical color of the Moldovan leadership will become less important for the United States," Andrei Popov said in a NewsMaker interview. Popov, former Deputy Foreign Minister of Moldova, added that Washington will renounce a whole series of Moldovan projects that were initiated by the Clinton circle. 

Also, in Bulgaria, the coalition headed by the Socialist Party prevailed in the second presidential round of the general election: Air Force General Rumen Radev topped his opponent Tsetska TsaÄeva by 4-5% (the result is not final). TsaÄeva was the candidate of the pro-government coalition GERB ("Citizens for European development of Bulgaria)."  

In the first round, Sunday, Nov. 6, no candidate reached the 30% necessary for the election: Radev was at 25.4% and TsaÄeva at 21.9%.  

The now president-elect said he was opposed to Bulgaria's permanence in NATO (of which the country has been a member since 2004) and in the EU, and has spoken out for closer relations with Russia.  

The Prime Minister, the hawk Boyko Borissov had promised to resign if Radev won, while he was still hoping for a TsaÄeva victory, seems to have kept his word, opening a crisis that does not seem easy to solve. 

In opposition to the overtly anti-Russian, phil-atlantic policies of former President Rosen Plevneliev and Boyko Borissov, Radev said that "deepening the dialogue with Russia will reduce confrontation and tension, and hopefully lead to the normalization of the situation in Syria and Ukraine."  

With regard to the anti-Russian sanctions, he stressed that this "is a matter of the government's responsibility. But, as President, I am committed to dialogue, to seek a solution with EU colleagues." As for internal affairs, he said "despite threats of the apocalypse," the voters "voted for change and democracy, overcoming apathy and fear." 

An entity that in contrast does not change policy towards Russia is the European Union.  Federica Mogherini,  EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, said that Brussels does not intend to change its own position on Russia, even if the White House, after the arrival of Donald Trump, pursues a rapprochement with the Kremlin.  

The EU, as Mogherini spelled it out, "has a principled stand on the issue of the annexation of the Crimea and on the situation in Ukraine, and will not change it, regardless of any changes of position by other countries, including the United States.

Russian President Vladimir Putin held telephone talks with the US President-elect Donald Trump. This was reported on Monday, November 14, by the Kremlin press service. 

The Russian leader again congratulated the Republican candidate for his victory in the elections and wished him success in the implementation of the pre-election program. The Head of State expressed readiness for partnership with the new administration of the White House "on principles of equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in each others internal affairs." 

Putin and Trump, as noted by the Kremlin press service, agreed in effect that Russian-US relations are in "very poor condition." They also spoke in favor of active joint work towards their normalization and "in the direction of constructive cooperation on a wide range of issues," including "the creation of a sound basis of bilateral ties through the development of trade and economic components." 

Both sides, as stated in the report, also agreed on the need for joint efforts in the struggle against the "common enemy number one" - international terrorism and extremism. "In this vein, they also discussed issues toward settlement of the crisis in Syria.". 

Putin and Trump agreed to continue contacts by phone and in the future to hold a private meeting. Preparations will be engaged in by representatives of both parties. 

Earlier, also on November 14, the President's press secretary Dmitry Peskov said that a meeting between Putin and Trump is not planned, but contacts between them are not excluded. "Contacts - this is not necessarily a meeting, it may be an exchange of messages, and telephone conversations," he said. 

On November 12 Trump announced that he had scheduled a telephone conversation with the Russian president. He also said that he had received messages from the majority of world leaders, including a "beautiful" letter from Putin. 

Trump was elected US President on the results of elections held on 8 November. On the same day, Putin was among the first congratulated the new US leader's telegram, wishing him every success as head of state.

It's impossible not to laugh and feel pity when looking at those who in the media and on social networks are now saying that the arrest of [Russian Economy Minister] Ulyukaev [for allegedly taking a $2 million bribe] was made possible exclusively thanks to the telephone conversation between Trump and Putin. According to this conspiracy theory, without Washington's permission, Putin never ever would have dared lay a finger on Ulyukaev and only now gathered the wiretap transcripts from many months and years before the American elections. 
Guys, let's respect our country. We are not Ukraine. Putin and the FSB don't need a nod from Washington to extinguish corruption. Open the calendar on your computer and look at what year it is. It is 2016 and those who are talking about some kind of permission from Washington are either stuck in 1995 or have confused today's Moscow with Kiev. There's no need to be like our neighbors, who to this day think that every day the sun rises only because of the State Department. Washington is not the center of the universe or the world. It's time to get used to this. 
If you want to find coincidences in time and draw meaningful conclusions from them, then I have a better proposal. Today, November 15th, the leader of the FSB of Russia, Alexander Vasilevich Bortnikov, is celebrating his 65th birthday. I wish him every success in his hard work. If someone  wants to come up with conspiracy theories, then the arrest of Ulyukaev should at least be attributed to this special day and not some kind of phone call with Trump. Judging by the hysterical statements of the American supporters of Clinton, even Trump's election would not have been possible without the active support of Russian intelligence. 
We will never know if this is actually true, but I suggest that we not make any excuses. It's really quite cool when the Western propaganda machine speaks of the omnipotence of the immortal KGB. 
And there's no need to write off the arrest as a fight between clans within the country's elite. Of course, there are clans and they are waging a tough fight against one another, but it is unlikely that any clan would like a situation in which anyone can be jailed regardless of their rank, position, and merit. After Ulyukaev's arrest, it turns out that nothing, no position, gives immunity from justice. This situation is not beneficial for any clan. And it is becoming all the more clear that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin is the driving force of the process of fighting against bureaucratic corruption.  
And finally, look at how warped various representatives of the non-systemic opposition and the pseudo-liberal media are. Just yesterday they were screaming on social networks about how everything is bad and terrible, corruption is everywhere, and no one is jailing senior officials. Well, last night they arrested Ulyukaev. Security forces are saying that they caught him red-handed. And what reaction do we see in the blogosphere and media? Cries about 1937, massive Putinist repressions, a disaster for the economy and the ruble, the night of the long knives, etc. I feel that soon this will be followed by calls to pay and repent. Ulyukaev has all the chances to become a prisoner of conscience and Khodorkovsky will stand in up in support of him. This is pathetic. 

The new year is coming soon. I would like to make the wish that we'll find a sane opposition under the Christmas tree or on new year's eve. We'll handle corruption and roads in one way or another.

KIEV IN PANIC: Tymoshenko declares Third Maidan, emergency govt committee prepares martial law November 14, 2016 - Fort Russ News - RusVesna - translated by J. Arnoldski - Ukrainian law enforcement and security agencies are preparing for possible protest actions in the country. A headquarters for responding to a surge of protest activities has been established at the base of the National Security and Defense Committee of Ukraine. This has been confirmed by Ukrainian journalists close to the headquarter's structures. Among the planned measures is a crackdown on protest actions and the introduction of martial law in Kiev if the situation deteriorates to armed confrontation. The headquarters is headed by the national security committee's secretary, Alexander Turchynov. According to insider sources, the special structure also includes Defense Minister Arsen Avakov, General Prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko, Chief of General Staff Viktor Muzhenko, SBU and intelligence representatives, and also people's deputy Sergey Pashinsky. The first meeting of the headquarters took place on Sunday at the presidential administration. Several resolutions were adopted. The police have been ordered not to allow vehicles transporting protesters into the capital. Kiev authorities and law enforcement have been ordered to by all means prevent equipment and tents from being set up on the Maidan. The municipality is supposed to seek a court ban on holding mass actions in the center of the capital in order to enact this. MP's from the coalition factions in parliament (the Petro Poroshenko Bloc and People's Front) have been suggested to organize private security detachments out of athletes and staff to help security forces disperse actions if necessary. Intelligence services and the SBU have been tasked with investigating evidence of a 'Russian trace' in the planned protests. They have also been instructed to look into shutting down TV channels and blocking internet sites. If all of these measures do not have the desired effect and protests are held on a large scale with the blockade of administrative buildings, then security forces could receive the order to disperse protests and arrest their leaders. Detachments of the National Guard, Armed Forces, and SBU special forces have been proposed to carry out such operations. At the headquarters meeting, the National Security and Defense Committee of Ukraine was instructed to prepare draft legislation on the imposition of martial law and a curfew in Kiev, sources have reported. The most likely pretext for protests will be the so-called 'shock bills', according to which as of October new prices are to be introduced for heating. Earlier, the Cabinet of Ministers raised them by 75-90%. Now, heating a two-bedroom apartment costs approximately 1,500 hryvnia, while the average salary is in the range of only 5,000 hryvnia. Earlier, authorities also raised the prices for electricity, gas, and cold water. Videos taken by locals have captured columns of military vehicles moving in the direction of Kiev. **** Novorossiya - translated by J. Arnoldski - Yulia Tymoshenko has urged Ukrainians to take to the streets on November 15th for an indefinite protest action in the center of Kiev. She stated this on Monday, November 14th, during a speech in the Verkhovna Rada. According to Tymoshenko, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and the National Bank have become a bastion of corruption and the head of state has appointed his business partners to key positions in the country. 'Today only the people can restore justice and put the government in its place. Tomorrow morning, citizens, including pensioners, will go out for an indefinite protest against the devaluation of the hryvnia, the increase in utility costs, and for returning their bank deposits,' she announced. Tymoshenko also added that the government is calling protesters 'the hand of the Kremlin', while in fact 'people are just fed up.' 'Officials hide behind the war, but they themselves are corrupting and robbing the country. Either the people will unite or the government will simply destroy the Ukrainian nation and Ukrainian state,' she emphasized. Information that Tymoshenko was preparing a new Maidan appeared as early as late September. It was reported that public organizations with links to her had purchased from 300 to 500 tents for use in mass actions. Tymoshenko recently stated that even Western Ukraine is starting to think positively about the country's former president, Viktor Yanukovych. 'If they think so in Galicia, then you can only imagine what thoughts people from other regions are having," she warned. Follow us on Facebook!

As reported earlier, the Admiral Grigorovich frigate of the Russian naval strike group in the Mediterranean Sea has launched cruise missiles against targets in Syria.  
The Ministry of Defense of Russia has published video footage of Caliber and Oniks cruise missile strikes against terrorist targets. 

The footage shows the moment of missiles hitting a terrorist warehouse of weapons and military vehicles and also a strike on militants' headquarters.

Several days ago, big news gripped headlines: Russia's Minister of Economic Development, Aleksey Ulyukaev, was arrested for receiving a bribe in the amount of $2 million. The supposedly unsinkable minister is now confessing enormous evidence to detectives of the Investigative Committee.  
A little later, the news appeared that President Vladimir Putin had received all information on the progress of the investigation of the minister. In other words, Ulyukaev's appeal to the president will come to naught, as the head of state was informed from the beginning on the course of investigations against corrupt members of the government. 
On the same day that Ulyukaev was arrested, the heads of law enforcement agencies and deputies to the governor of the Kemerovo region were also arrested for taking bribes. Today, November 16th, additional news has emerged: the investigation is being carried out not only against now ex-minister Ulyukaev, but also a number of senior officials. This has been reported by the newspaper Vedomosti citing a senior employee in security agencies.  
According to the report of this well-informed publication, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, presidential aide Andrey Belousov, aide to First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, Marina Romanova, and the head of the Economic Development Department, Oksana Tarasenko, have also become targets of the investigation.  
What does all of this mean? Several things are immediately indicated.  
1. Purges in the state apparatus can now touch even the highest spheres, up to the level of ministers and vice ministers. 
2. The 'hunt' for corrupt high-ranking officials has a systemic character as evidenced by the number of people potentially subject to investigations and the breadth of its geographical and institutional reach. 
3. A blow is being inflicted first and foremost against representatives of the pro-Western liberal grouping in the Russian establishment. In the opinion of specialists asked by the author, Ulyukaev was no professional in his work. Even less of a competent professional is Dvorkovich, the youngest and perhaps most incompetent vice minister in the Russian government. How the outcome of this rapid investigation against him will end is still unknown. But the chair beneath him has been shaken. 
Of course, it is too early to draw any far-reaching conclusions. But certain facts suggest that the purge in the higher echelons of power is gaining tremendous momentum. Several months ago, we wrote in an article for Fort Russ that President Putin is getting rid of (1) the corrupt and (2) the liberal-Westernist layer of the Russian ruling elite. Now this opinion is being backed by supporting evidence. These purges began after the Russian parliamentary elections and after the change (even if not yet official) of the US administration. 

I would posit that both factors are significant, and the circumstances are not accidental. If we are right, then Russia and its president are starting a new game at home and on the international field.

The Art of the Deal: Trump's phone calls provoke hysteria in Kiev and panic in Brussels November 16, 2016 - Fort Russ - Ruslan Ostashko, PolitRussia - translated by J. Arnoldski - Until recently it was believed that Donald Trump's main media weapon is his Twitter account, through which the president-elect of the US fights his political opponents, beats the media, and 'trolls' foreign politicians. But this was true only until Trump won the elections. Since his victory, the American billionaire now uses his phone as his main weapon of mass (information) destruction. For example, just recently we learned it was enough for Trump to simply talk with Putin on the phone to drive all top European officials to hysterics and panic. Only one conversation, and the British media is already talking about nervous breakdowns among Brussels politicians who simply don't understand how to live in this terrifying new reality in which the US president-elect easily finds opportunities to reach understanding with Putin. This means that many European politicians who built their careers on selling Russophobia might be left without a job, career, and money. The Financial Times writes that British diplomats are preparing for a 'diplomatic crisis' caused by a possible rapprochement between the US and Russia. Between the lines, it can be read that London has simply no ready-made solutions for this problem. The reactions of American and European media are suddenly creating some kind of aura of a miracle around Trump and Putin's conversation, or a universal catastrophe from the perspective of Clinton's supporters and ISIS fans. For example, the popular American newspaper USA Today has released a thoughtful article entitled 'After Trump chat, Putin's airstrikes pound Syria' which hints that it is Trump's fault that Russian aircraft have stepped up bombardments against the Syrian terrorists so near and dear to the heart of every true American liberal. It seems like American journalists are telling us that 'this wouldn't happen under Clinton' which, of course, is a shameless lie. Everything would be the same, the only difference being that Syrian militants would die from Russian bombs only after receiving their paychecks from the CIA or Pentagon. And now they are completely terrified, as the Americans aren't paying out and the Russians are bombing them. Let them at least feel comforted by the fact that they have sincere sympathy from Clinton's pool of American journalists. In fairness, it should be noted that Trump's phone conversations are provoking not only unhappiness, but are also a real treat. Kiev's political club is now filled with euphoria over the fact that Poroshenko managed to get through to talk to the US president-elect. This really is a great achievement. That Poroshenko didn't get told off after what official Kiev did during the American election campaigns is a real success. It is a pity that the only description of the conversation is on Poroshenko's website. Trump's official website doesn't say a word about it. Trump's website features the news of his conversation with Putin, while nothing is said of the chat with Poroshenko. Nothing at all. Poroshenko's website doesn't deserve much confidence as a source. After all, Poroshenko has already been caught in prank conversations, but even if we can assume that the two really did talk, then Kiev's euphoria is still not quite logical. Sure, official Ukrainian propaganda says that the two presidents agreed to meet, but no specifics in terms of dates were given. Does anyone really believe that Poroshenko is such a genius in psychological maneuvers and such a titan in political negotiations that he will be capable of changing the opinion of the US president-elect on Crimea, Ukraine, and the need to cooperate with Russia? It will be interesting to see how this looks. On the one hand, Trump is a billionaire, businessman, and a man with a very difficult character. On the other hand, so is Poroshenko, who quickly needs to convince Trump to pour money into the geopolitical project known as 'Ukraine.' It's a pity that they won't sell tickets to see this show. I would pay to see such with my own eyes even though I think that the conversation will not be very long. Most likely, it will end with Trump's famous catchphrase: 'You're fired!' Bloomberg has published an article headlined 'Trump, Putin and Sluggish Reforms Push Ukraine Toward Russia.' In this piece, American journalists gathered the opinions of Western politicians and experts on Ukraine's future, among which it is difficult to find anything optimistic. Overall, the interviewed experts agree that Ukraine is out of luck. For example, the ardent Russophobe and Vladimir Putin critic Ian Bremmer articulated his vision of Ukraine's future in the following words: 'Trump will want to put points on the board and I think it is highly likely the U.S. under Trump will move quickly to re-establish the relationship with Russia, on Syria in particular. That clearly throws Ukraine under a bus.' This time, I don't even want to argue with this American political scientist. Only one thing interests me: will Trump put all of Ukraine up for sale or only parts of it? Follow us on Facebook!

Russia's defense ministry's official spokesperson, Major General Igor Konashenkov, has reported that Su-33 fighters based on the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier cruiser have killed no less than 30 militants from the Jebhat al-Nusra grouping in the Syrian province of Idlib. As Konashenkov reported on Tuesday, militants have suffered serious losses as a result of 'massive fire strikes' and a large bandit grouping of al-Nusra has been destroyed. 
According to General Konashenkov, the death of least 30 terrorists as been confirmed by multiple intelligence channels. Also confirmed among the dead were field commanders Muhammad Khelala, Abu Jaber Harmuja, and Abul Baha al-Asfari, who was planning an offensive on Aleppo. Al-Asfari was responsible for the unification of the remnants of Al-Nusra reserves in Aleppo and Hama.  
As stated earlier this week by Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, Russia has begun a large strike operation inflicting fire damage on Islamic State and Jebhat Al-Nusra positions in the Syrian provinces of Idlib and Homs.  
The Admiral Kuznetsov heavy aircraft carrier cruiser, the only cruiser of its class in the Russian Navy, has been engaged in the operation. The cruiser is now in the Mediterranean Sea at the head of the Northern Fleet. 

Also participating in the operation is the Admiral Grigorovich frigate (a guard ship) which, according to defense ministry reports, has struck the positions of militants in Syria with Calibre cruise missiles.

Petro Poroshenko's regime has initiated criminal proceedings in which figure around 10,000 participants of the so-called Anti-Terrorist Operation in Donbass. This was stated on the sidelines of the Verkhovna Rada by the former head of the Donbass Nationalist Battalion and PM, Semen Semenchenko. 
According to Semenchenko, 'volunteers' have come under criminal proceedings insofar as they do not have the right to bear arms and use them in Donbass, since martial law has not been instituted in the country. Now all such 'volunteers' could theoretically be declared war criminals. 
Semenchenko stated:  

'Those volunteers whose situation is discussed every day from the parliamentary podium are currently under threat. More than 10,000 criminal cases have been initiated for various reasons. Noncompliance with the law on defense, the fact that martial law has not been imposed and, accordingly, part of the functions carried out by servicemen are now de jure a crime. For example, in 2014, the National Guard of Ukraine added, so to say, more than 10,000 reservists to the ATO. These servicemen did not have the rights of National Guardsmen, did not have the right to bear arms, and did not have the right to participate in the war - they did not have the right to kill people and be killed. Now more than thousands of people could at any moment be charged as criminals if the government or political situation changes.'

The international community could recognize the international legal status of the Donetsk People's Republic if Kiev finally discredits itself in the negotiation process on settling the conflict in Donbass. This was stated by the acting foreign minister of the DPR and representative of the republic to the political subgroup of the Contact Group, Natalya Nikonorova. 
Nikoronova is sure that sooner or later the conditions will be created for the people's republics to be recognized as participants in international relations with full rights. 
'If we consider the precedent set by Kosovo, which was immediately recognized by several member states of the UN, then the DPR could became a full subject of international relations after a very short period of time given favorable geopolitical factors,' Nikonorova stated. 
According to her, these conditions will be met if Kiev 'finally discredits itself in the negotiation process' on resolving the conflict in Donbass. 
At the present moment, the DPR and LPR are not recognized by a single UN member state. The authorities of the people's republics of Donetsk and Lugansk unilaterally declared independence from Ukraine on May 12th and April 28th, 2014 respectively. The independence of the DPR and LPR is recognized only by South Ossetia, which does not have the status of a recognized state and is not part of the UN. 
For a long time already, the settlement of the situation in Donbass has been complicated largely by Kiev. Even according to Ukraine's representative to the humanitarian subgroup of the Contact Group, Viktor Medvedchuk, Kiev is purposefully delaying the realization of the Minsk Agreements.  

Recently, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavel Klimkin bragged that Kiev is discussing the formulation of a 'road map' for implementing the Minsk Agreements only with Berlin and Paris, but Moscow is equally a guarantor of the document.

What scares Kiev politicians more than anything? What is their number one fear? No, not Russian tanks coming down Kreshchatik street. They aren't afraid of Russian tanks for two reasons. First of all, Kiev politicians have made so much money selling media disinformation to the West about Russian tanks invading Ukraine that they themselves are no longer afraid of this happening. They have a whole business, a whole image of this and all relations with the West are built on their promises to provoke Russia into open military intervention. These promises have brought them money and power, so the very thought of a Russian military invasion warms their soul. 
Now for the second reason. Kiev is now ruled by very opinionated people who are 100% convinced that, if something happens, they'll manage to make it to Borispol and fly away. They hope that after fleeing from Russian tanks they will be provided with jobs, money, and respect for the rest of their life. They'll form a Ukrainian government in exile and follow Khodorkovsky with endless lawsuits in international courts and travel the world giving lectures about how much they've suffered from Putin and how much they miss unfortunate Ukraine. Thus, the Kiev regime is not afraid of a Russian invasion. They have an entirely different nightmare, and it is precisely this other nightmare that is creeping into their daily reality. 
I periodically try to explain to the Ukrainian experts that I encounter in television studios that Ukraine has worn out even its strongest supporters in the West. They've tired them out so much and so thoroughly that these supporters are already starting to discuss things that were unthinkable a year ago. Remember PACE - that bunch of European bureaucrats who condemned Russia for aggression against Ukraine and deprived the Russian delegation of its voting rights? Well now Ukrainian deputies are saying that PACE is preparing a devastating report on human rights failures in Ukraine. The chairman of PACE has even stated that it is necessary to bring back the Russian delegation to work in PACE, and he even wrote a letter to Vyacheslav Volodin with the proposal to personally meet to discuss this issue. Members of the Ukrainian delegation to PACE are writing articles about the powerful Russian lobby which could steal PACE and force it to 'betray Ukraine.' 
Here's another example. After Ukrainian authorities fulfilled all 144 conditions for obtaining a vise free regime, European politicians turned to outright mocking them. During Rada discussions, it was recently revealed that Martin Schulz, the chairman of the European Parliament, now binds the visa-free regime to the fulfillment of the Minsk Agreements. An unpleasant situation has unfolded for official Kiev. If they blame Russia for not fulfilling the Minsk Agreements, then they'll have to admit that the EU has made Kiev dependent on the Kremlin's goodwill. If this is not so, then they'll have to admit that Martin Schulz has de facto blamed Kiev for disrupting the Minsk Agreements and has punished the Ukrainian side by depriving it of its coveted visa free regime. Amidst all of this, the Ukrainian propaganda that the whole world supports Poroshenko looks very unconvincing. 
Yesterday I asked whether Trump would put Ukraine up for sale as a whole or in parts . Today I can present the Finnish version of the answer to this burning question. Former Finnish army commander General Gustav Hagglund told local media that 'dividing Ukraine into two parts will put an end to the conflict in the country' and said that Trump will reach an agreement with Putin on concluding the conflict. A year ago, imagining that a representative of a European army would express such a position in the media was unthinkable, but now it is normal.  

In fact, I am not convinced that Trump will opt for this variant, but it cannot be excluded. The most important point is that no one is going to ask Ukrainian politicians about their opinions on the future of their country. This is Kiev's greatest fear. On one fine day, they will wake up in a country that has been simply gifted to Putin.

CIA and FBI agents "urgently withdrawn" from Ukraine November 16, 2016 - Fort Russ News - PolitNavigator - translated by J. Arnoldski - American intelligence officers stationed at the General Prosecutor and SBU buildings in Kiev have urgently left Ukraine. This was reported by former Verkhovna Rada deputy Igor Markov live on the Russian debate-show 'The Meeting Place.' According to Markov, this is evidence that the US is 'slyly withdrawing' from Ukraine. 'A week ago, all the FBI representatives based at the General Prosecutor and the CIA officers stationed in the SBU were urgently redeployed to Romania and Czech Republic. For security forces, this is a clear signal that the US is slyly withdrawing from Ukraine. Only analysts remain, all operative agents have left,' Markov stated. Follow us on Facebook!

November 18, 2016 -  By Eduard Popov for Fort Russ - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


On November 17th, the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly voted on a resolution to combat the glorification of Nazism proposed by Russia in collaboration with 54 states. The delegations of 131 out of 193 states voted to support the resolution, which also concerned combatting contemporary forms of racism. 48 delegations abstained, including some EU countries. Only three countries voted against the document: Palau, the US, and Ukraine. Thus, the situation from 2015 was repeated, the only difference being that back then Canada voted not to condemn Nazism. 
At first glance, what is surprising is the absence of the Baltic states, specifically Latvia and Estonia, on this extra short list of those opposed. It is in Latvia and Estonia that the glorification of the 'exploits' of local Waffen SS divisions has taken a most radical and consistent form. However, this can be explained by the fact that the Baltic states are EU members and are therefore compelled to restrain some of their desires.  
Everything is more or less clear with the United States' vote. After the Second World War, numerous Nazi collaborators were settled in America, especially Ukrainians from both factions of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. Apparently, the influence of the Ukrainian (Galician) diaspora has a, if not decisive, then at least important impact on US policy. 
Ukraine is even less restrained than the Baltic states of the EU. The idolization of Nazi collaborators has begun to be widespread at least since the victory of the Maidan (if we don't count Viktor Yushchenko's presidency), so Ukrainians are striving to catch up and surpass Latvia and Estonia in the open glorification of Nazism.   
In the future, additional legislative measures against the glorification of the Waffen SS and Hitlerite collaborationists will need to be adopted. It is entirely unclear why Russia has become the victim of attacks by the neo-Nazi Baltic regimes for 'Soviet occupation' but is in no hurry to make counter-claims against those countries which now openly hold marches for veterans and adherents of the Waffen SS, a criminal organization which was convicted at the Nuremberg Tribunal.  
Measures of an economic nature should be taken. On November 18th, a report surfaced that Rosselkhoznadzor (the Russian state organization overseeing agricultural imports) gave permission for canned fish to be delivered from Latvia and Estonia. This has caused great bewilderment and indignation. First of all, these states, as EU members, have imposed sanctions against Russia. Secondly, their Waffen SS marches make any trade concessions from Russia morally unacceptable. After all, no other country suffered more from the crimes of Nazism than Russia.  
The Baltic Waffen SS divisions fought (or, more precisely, carried out punitive operations) largely on the territory of Russia's northern regions. After the war, the Soviet communist regime treated these ex-executioners fairly gently and, in doing so, likely committed a big mistake. the Baltic Nazis did not appreciate humanity, and the same thing can be said of the Banderites in Ukraine. 
Russia should follow the example of Poland and adopt legislation on a state level which names the criminal deeds of the organizations in the former USSR countries (above all, Ukraine and the Baltics) which collaborated with the Hitlerite occupation regime. This means the national formations of the Waffen SS and collaborationist groupings such as OUN-UPA, etc.).  

Russia has the right to impose economic, legal, and social measures against these countries and urge the international community to join the fight against the glorification of Nazism at the state level.

- Enrico VIGNA in  Opinione Pubblica , translated from Italian by Tom Winter - 

The election of Igor Dodon follows upon decades of the robbery and systematic looting of the country by politicians and related parties, financed and protected by  

the West,  the International Monetary Fund,  the World Bank,  the EU and  NATO,  
which have made the country Europe's poorest; in fact, according to an IMF study, per capita income in Moldova at constant purchasing power is $ 5,006. This is a figure referring to those who physically live in the country, disregarding those who have emigrated to the West.  

Even a UNDP report (United Nations Development Program), has determined that 8.1% of the population lives below the international poverty line of $ 1.25 a day (2000-2007); but 48.5% live below the so-called national poverty line.  

Moldova is a country located between Ukraine and Romania with population of 3.6 million, of whom more than half live abroad. Its official language is Romanian, but a large part speaks Russian.  

Moldova is considered one of the most corrupt countries in Europe, preceded only by Georgia, located at 103rd position in the Corruption Perceptions Index 2015 of Transparency International.  

On November 13 there was the second round of presidential elections, where the candidate of the Socialist Party of the Republic of Moldova prevailed with 52.18% of the total, but in Moldova without the foreign votes, the figure is 75%.  

This is despite the whole set of the "big powers" system: parties, apparatus, media and pro-Western NGOs that have made every effort and financial investment, electoral sabotage, blackmail, pressure and threats in the press and the media, which are completely in the hands of pro-Western rulers.  

An example reported by the electoral bloc for the Socialist candidate Dodon is that while in the West the Moldovan government set up hundreds of polling places to allow their emigrants to vote, (overwhelmingly supporters of the West as they became rich and culturally westernized, no need to comment further), in the first round in Italy 80% had voted for the American Sandu and 7% for Dodon!  

BUT, in Russia and in other countries where the migrant workers do not recognize the West as a model or solution, the government reduced polling places to a minimum: just think that in a city like Moscow, where more than 700,000 Moldovan emigrants live and work, the government only put up three polling places. 

On the ballot were Igor Dodon, a lawyer and economist, until 2011 leader of Moldovan communists, who then joined the Socialist Party, of which he is currently president; and Maia Sandu, former education minister from 2012 to 2015, of the corrupt governments of Filat, who is currently in jail.  

She represents the Action and Solidarity Party, supported by the US and EU; she graduated in the United States where she lived from 1989 to 1994, served as an official of the World Bank, protected by the Soros Foundation.  

Igor Dodon is a man who comes from the people, the father of three sons, the person who founded the Charity Foundation "Solution," which, in all the years of its existence has helped tens of thousands of people; who organized and leads the patriotic campaign "I love Moldova," which managed hundreds of actions at national level supporting the Moldovan identity and the defense of Orthodoxy as the spiritual heritage of the people.  

The clash between the candidates was very deep and went beyond the exclusively Moldovan reality. Rather it involves a change of balance with geopolitical meanings, which could give a strong blow to the Western hegemonic and imperialist aims: just think of the internal problem of Transnistria, the hitherto close relationship between the coup leaders in Ukrainian Kiev and the pro-europeen forces of Chisinau, the position towards the Donbass Popular Republics, Belarus, South Ossetia and especially the position of rejecting NATO.  

Yes this a sensitive issue and a harbinger of strategic upheavals; in addition to the rejection of reunification with (in fact as a submission to) Romania, Ms Sandu supported the Association and Free Trade with the European Union Agreement ratified in 2014, which is now part of the DCFTA (Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. Dodon instead proposed and supported Moldova's entry into the Eurasian Economic Union with Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan, and supported trying for closer relations and investment with China. 


The Dodon victory is based 90% on the population that lives out the devastated social reality produced during thirty years of robbery and wild privatization, namely the workers and the poorest peasants, regional minorities such as the Gagauz, the Bessarabi and the Russians; by the hundreds of thousands of migrants in Russia; and even the Orthodox Church supports the change.  

The pro-European candidate was driven primarily by the inhabitants of the capital Chisinau, by profiteers who settled in the state and public offices, through corruption and political favoritism, and especially by the emigrants in the West.  

Now, it is a matter of waiting for the excellent election platform to be applied into Moldovan reality, and above all the next steps, including calling new elections.  

One thing is certain: the programs hitherto adopted resulted in impoverishment and social devastation, products of Western policies in the former Soviet countries, but they have found they here an unexpected setback, and the Moldovan people, like others in the realities of Eastern Europe, are taking charge of their destiny.   

Hope finds a seedling to nurture and strengthen. In any case it is a disturbing signal for the aims of Western expansion and domination, and especially the military ones and oppression by NATO.

November 19, 2016 -  By Eduard Popov for Fort Russ - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


The other day, the disturbing news came from Lvov, the unofficial capital of Ukrainian Galicia, that the Lvov regional council has filed a lawsuit to forcibly evict the Pushkin Russian Cultural Center. As the head of the regional council, V. Girnyak, said in his statement, organizations tied to the Anti-Terrorist Operation are preparing to transfer the building on Korolenko Street. The Lvov deputies hardly expect to earn more money from these 'ATOers.' Rather, the eviction of the Pushkin Russian Cultural Center is explained by a different motive: once again punishing anyone ideologically representative of 'enemy' Russian culture. 
This center's building was leased to the Russian community of Lvov in 1990. In 1999, the then mayor Vasiliy Kuybida, set the symbolic rent fee of 5 hryvnia (around $1 back then).  
Let us quote one founding document signed by Ukraine, the Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership between the Russian Federation and Ukraine from May 31st, 1997. Point 12 of the agreement reads: 'The High Agreeing Parties shall protect the ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and religious identities of national minorities on their territory and create conditions for the fostering of their identity'¦.they will contribute to creating equal opportunities and conditions for studying the Russian language in Ukraine and the Ukrainian language in the Russian Federation, training pedagogical staff for teaching these languages in educational establishments, and for these purposes provide equal state support.'  
Points 1-2 of the agreement are based on the recognition of the friendly relations between the countries and their territorial integrity. Hence why the agreement is often called a border treaty. For Ukraine, whose territorial sovereignty over some territories (including Galicia, which was part of the Second Polish Republic until September 1939) is quite disputed, this agreement was a real gift. It is no coincidence that a number of patriotic politicians in Russia demanded that this document not be signed.  
Russia's recognition of Kiev's sovereignty over territories included in the Ukrainian state is founded on Ukraine's observance of the rights of its Russian-cultured citizens. After the coup d'etat in 2014, Ukraine began pursuing a policy of cultural genocide (ethnocide) against the Russian-cultured population. Now Ukraine is discussing the initiative of the scandalously infamous politician Irina Farion to deprive Russian residents in Ukraine of civil rights. In fact, this measure is already being implemented. The number of Russian schools has rapidly declined while Russian organizations are being prosecuted and their activities are under close surveillance by Kiev's intelligence services. 
In accordance with the 1997 treaty, an entire network of federal and regional organizations of Ukrainians is funded in Russia . For example, in the Rostov region there is a city-level and regional national-cultural autonomy of Ukrainians. The organization receives funding from the city and regional budgets. Its head, the businessman Makarchuk, is a member of the Public Chamber of the Rostov region and is proud of his friendship with Rostov governor Vasili Golubev. Meanwhile, Makarchuk is published on the website of the Ukrainian neo-Nazi Svoboda party and frequently makes Russophobic statements. 

Unfortunately, Russia is largely to blame for the fact that the civil rights of Russian-cultured people in Ukraine are being massively violated. An example of this is the patronizing policy of the Rostov region authorities. But on the federal level as well, the state does not have sufficient (or any at all) efforts to defend the Russian population of Ukraine (nearly half of the country's total population).  
Meanwhile, a more responsible attitude towards obligations would lead to a discussion on the 1997 treaty. In a situation in which the second country (Ukraine) massively violates the treaty's basic premises, then Russia has the right to withdraw from the treaty with all the legal and political implications. I see no reason for the Russian budget to support the activities of Ukrainian organizations in Russia or recognize the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine.

While US State Department dodging questions into its allegations is nothing new, the spokesperson John Kirby has recently gone the extra mile. Kirby stated that he would not be treating RT as an equal media organisation, to the likes of western mainstream media. Referring to the fact that Russia Today is "state sponsored" media, this apparently obliterates his responsibility to provide evidence into allegations of "Russian bombing of hospitals in Syria."  
Part of RT funding does come from the government, however this is publicly listed information and not a secret as is often "exposed". Who would you rather listen to - state media that is indeed supported by the government that you elected, or corporate interests of the 1%? Furthermore, the Russian Ministry of Defence provides weekly briefings of its own, so Kirby's suggestion to "ask your own government" only highlights his seeming obliviousness to pretty much everything. 
Kirby conveniently "doesn't know" that "respectable" CNN or BBC journalists actively distort the truth to the outlets, while working in Russia. I thought Jennifer Psaaki would be hard to beat, but then this guy happened.... 
Maria Zakharova holds the equivalent position in Russia as John Kirby does in the US and I think it is fair to say she takes the cake.

How close is too close for NATO to spread Eastwards, and how far will they test the boundaries? Talks of Ukraine joining the military alliance were on the agenda the 2000s, but ceased after Russia's swift response to the Georgian aggression in Tskhinvali in 2008. Currently, the Ukraine is unable to join NATO due to internal conflict - the absence of which is a prerequisite for new members.  
It would seem then that stopping the US-initiated war in Eastern Ukraine would be beneficial to US interests - or, are they fully aware, that this most certainly will not be allowed to happen as a direct threat to Russia's security? 

The outtake is from annual Q&A 2014

I've already taken note of the fact that one only has to mention some problems of the European Union and the reactions of our Westernists will boil down to one argument: 'Yeah, sure, Europe is rotting, but it still hasn't rotted since the times of the USSR.' Now, if I say that the EU is faced with the prospects of a real collapse, then our Westernists will probably write something similar to me and accuse me of belonging to Kremlin propaganda. 
No matter what, I will say that the EU risks collapsing in the foreseeable future. In the end, there is nothing wrong with being considered a Kremlin propagandist, especially since I am joined by French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who yesterday said the same thing. Yes, he even used the word 'collapse.' What do you think - did Putin buy him or does he really think this? 
The French prime minister made such a statement in Berlin, where he went to discuss with Angela Merkel how to live in the new epoch of Trump. to be honest, the tone of his interview in the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung suggests that his talks with Merkel are more reminiscent of a collective therapy session than a brainstorming session. Let me tell you what this really reminded me of. 
Following Trump's victory, many American universities held special psychological support events for students who couldn't cope with the grief of Hillary Clinton's defeat. Volunteers and university employees created a pleasant atmosphere for suffering American youth, comforting them and handing out coloring books for adults, brought special therapeutic dogs to pet, and gave students the opportunity to cry a river. Some tests and exams have even been cancelled. 
The actions of European politicians following the US elections really remind me of this kind of collective therapy: they cry together, grieve together, convince each other that everything will be fine, but don't come up with anything concrete. In the interview with the French prime minister, it is difficult to find any kind of concrete action plan. The statement that 'France and Germany should be the leaders of Europe' is not an action program. France and Germany have already long since been the leaders of Europe, and the problem is once again that many European don't like where they've brought them. The English and part of the English political elite disliked this situation to such an extent that they voted to leave the European Union. Even Manuel Valls already suspects that Britain won't be the last country to ask to disembark from the European Titanic. 
The prime minister of France suddenly realizes that the EU is faced with the problem of migrants. This is big progress, but with whom is he going to solve this problem? With Merkel? With the very same Merkel who has flooded Germany with migrants and whose approval rating is collapsing for this reason? 
There is the theory that France's prime minister went to Germany to give Frau Chancellor much needed moral support. Western analysts have declared Merkel the 'savior of the free world,' but she is the last person who would fit this role, and she herself is not very comfortable in it. Western analysts are at least correctly writing that Merkel does not have the charisma, army, or economy to be the 'leader and savior of the free world,' and the EU is falling apart. 
Let me recall several events which could finish European stability. In December, there will be presidential elections in Austria which could be won by the candidate that is inclined to recognize Crimea and inaugurate Austria's exit from the EU. Also in December, there will be a referendum in Italy, the results of which could send Renzi's government into resignation, thus causing a political crisis and a practical paralysis of decision-making at the EU level as long as Italian politicians can't agree with each other.  
2017 will bring even more interesting events. There will be presidential elections in France that might be won by Sarkozy or Marine Le Pen, both of whom are bad enough for Merkel. Merkel herself could lose the chair of Chancellor, although she will try to run for a fourth term. 
In fact, I want to ask the fans of Western democracy and peaceful transfer of power: how will a fourth term for Merkel pan out? Democratically? What about a fourth term for Putin? No? The double standards are revealed. 
Judging by the experience of the US election campaign and the Brexit referendum, I already know who will be blamed. Do you think that Obama has just kindheartedly declared Russia a superpower capable of influencing the world? Of course not. This is an artillery barrage preceding a massive information campaign with the message 'Putin is undermining the EU!' After all, Europeans wouldn't understand how the EU could be undermined by a 'regional power' with an economy 'torn to shreds.' 
Everything will be clear. I don't even rule out that our Kiev opponents will send the next set of fakes to Berlin or Paris in the form of a stolen letter from Surkov, only for BBC and Euronews to then expose some kind of plan to scare voters. This will be, of course, hilarious, but it won't help European politicians.

"Behind the fiestas and the photo ops, Mr Obama, you came unwanted and you left unwanted" said the statement of the Federation of Greek Women on the visit of the US President. The statement criticizes the fact that Barack Obama "pronounced benedictions to our "left" prime minister for "reforms that bled the Greek people" and notes that "the US has a major share of responsibility for the massacre, not only of our own people, but also the peoples of the world." Details of the Communication: Mr. Obama came to Greece reading beautiful words ... He came equipped with "mirrors for the natives" with shameless and cheap flattery for the sacrifices of the Greek people and with an Ode to Democracy 'made in Greece' dripping from his lips. The outgoing US president had good words for our "left" prime minister for the "reforms" that bled the Greek people, apparently recognizing in Mr. Tsipras a kindred spirit (albeit at a lower level). He certainly avoided telling us that the "democracy," he so often mentioned has proved most convenient for exploiters of our toil.  It is the "democracy" soaked through in child poverty and misery.  It is the "democracy" of refugees and wars, the "democracy" of imperialist interventions from Ukraine to the Middle East and Africa.  It is the "democracy" of the employers' terrorism, labor flexibility, one job for each two and three employees.  It is the "democracy" that has many living on crumbs or the soup kitchens, while a trillion. euro of capital is concentrated in Greece on our slaving, and still looking to find where to invest to give more profits to monopoly groups.   It is the "democracy" that supports an alliance of wolves and a mutual extermination system.  This is the "democracy" concealed in the pat words of Mr. Obama And, of course, he shoved under the carpet what the Greek people know well, but that our Greek Prime Minister preferred to "forget:" that the US has a major share of responsibility for the massacre, not only of our own people, but also people of all the world, rapidly now extending to every corner of the globe.  No family woman should fall into their snare! We, the women of the radical women's movement do not want, and can not be fooled by, the supposed gifts that the former "President of the World" came to offer us. We are the first to know that the famous egalitarianism of "democracy" he praised us for does not mean equality of standing! Instead, it is the most deceptive wrapping of our occupational and social inequity. We, the women of daily toil not accept the lure of supposedly "democratic" and "peaceful" declarations serving only the imperialist plans in our region and creating an immediate danger to our lives and future. We, the women who participate in associations and groups of IAHS have had enough fine words from wherever they come from.   We will not succumb to the deadly lullaby of false hope and insidious complacency. We constantly exhibit with our participation in the daily struggle our desire for a life without exploitation and oppression, without wars, and without their attendant refugees.

In response to the deployment of American missile defense systems in Europe, Russia is being forced to strengthen its aerospace defenses on its western borders, Viktor Ozerov, the chairman of the Federation Council's Committee on Defense and Security, told RIA Novosti. 
'As a responsive measure against such a type of threat, we will be compelled to strengthen our aerospace defense system in the western direction and put into operation additional forces and means for resolving the covering of relevant facilities and control points. This strengthening of forces will include the deployment of S-400 and Iskander complexes in Kaliningrad, as well as the creation of new formations in the Western and Southern Military Districts,' the senator said. 
Ozerov remarked that one of the arguments which Russia has put forward in relation to the deployment of American missile systems in Europe is the fear that this infrastructure could be promptly converted to accommodate strike weapons, particularly land-based cruise missiles. 
'These fears are being confirmed today,' Ozerov stated. 
According to the senator, along with motorized infantry and tank units, the divisions being created in the Western and Southern Military Districts will include troops and anti-air defense means. 'In addition, we are not hiding this, we are improving our aerospace forces and developing new, modern missiles of both the 'land-air' and 'air-land' classes which would be capable of overwhelming the air defenses that the US has in Europe,' Ozerov explained. 
Senator Ozerov added that the additional deployment of arms capable of neutralizing the US missile defense threat is a symmetrical response. According to him, Russia is constantly monitoring the situation and is 'ready to respond.' 
In May of last year, the construction of the Aegis Ashore facility was completed which includes American missile systems in the vicinity of the Romanian town of Deveselu. Another such facility is to appear by 2018 in northern Poland. 

Moscow has repeatedly stated that the US and NATO's actions in deploying anti-missile defense systems in Europe represent a threat to Russia's national security and could undermine strategic stability in the region.

November 21, 2016 - Fort Russ -  Sergey Shargunov, SvPressa - translated by J. Arnoldski - 


When we'll be at war, When we'll be at war, I'll fly forward to meet the bullets On my black steed'¦ 
This song is playing out of an open window. Along with the song, there is a black SUV flying down an empty, shot-out road. It's as if there was a storm around, trees are swaying around. 
Driving is a blue-eyed man in a vest and camouflage jacket. Wildly flying down the road of death to Cossack songs. The sun shines in his eyes. 
Then the words are drowned out by swishes and rattles'¦bullets, mines, and automatic grenade launchers. They're shooting all day. 
Upon returning from the frontline - this road of death - I interviewed Zakharchenko.  
Sergey Shargunov (S): What qualities do you value in people? 
Alexander Zakharchenko (Z): The main thing in a human is his inner core, his beliefs and ability to defend them. Under any circumstances. Here we have many decent, brave, and honest people. But the main thing is this core, which is important, real, and manly. Maybe you can't be a soldier for one reason or another, but you have to be a man. Your personality must have integrity. 
S: I am once again in Donbass, and I see that people have some kind of astonishing sense of dignity. Donbass is burning for the third year already. What is Donbass' character based on? 
Z: I believe that the quality of the people here was formed over centuries. Once this was just a wild field without its own sense of dignity and it was impossible to live here. Of course, this impacted the specificity of the mining profession. It allows one to respect himself first and foremost. And by respecting yourself, you can love your Homeland, your loved ones. All of this is thanks to respect for where you live. Inner respect is transmitted to people with their mother's milk.  
A Russian man inherently has a sense of his own dignity. But some forgot about this. Even here, some people started to forget this. 2014 gave people something very valuable. The Russian spirit returned. An external threat awakened in people those qualities which, unfortunately, we had forgotten. 
As strange as it sounds, it is thanks to this that our qualities were awakened in us. It's as if we were born again. Hence came the ability to fight, resist, respect ourselves, and the courage, faith, and will to sacrifice.  
You just saw the guys on the frontline. Marik, the guy from Mariupol, has been wounded 8 times. The girl Dasha is our wonderful cook. She's small, fragile, but is fighting and hasn't left the frontline for 2 months. She respects herself. She respects her husband, her comrades, her land, and Russia. These are all of the qualities that are innate to us. 
S: Everyone here, like the speakers at today's meeting in Gorlovka for example, ask me how long this can all last. 
Z: Sergey, can I ask you? How long can this all last? I'm asking the very same question. Believe me, I'd like to ask this question not only to you, but the State Duma, the government, and Russia in general.  
We, Russians, are fighting here for the third year. Russians live here, and we want to return to the Homeland, to Russia.  
How much longer should we fight here? What should we do? Explain us, and we will do the rest, we'll fight and withstand. Just explain and tell us what we should do, what point we should reach, what we should capture, and how we can help this process of returning, so that it would all finish faster.  
S: What does being the head of the republic mean to you? 
Z: First and foremost, it is a duty and service. It is not power, but the opportunity to fix what, unfortunately, wasn't fixed for 23 years. 
I am not the captain of a rebel frigate and this isn't a naval or Corsair romance novel. We are here on the frontline, a frontline which has brought together the best representatives of Russia, where the people's true spirit manifests itself. Liberals say that we should be the West, America. We should show that we don't have to, that we ourselves are free people. And, perhaps, thanks to our service, Russia is also waking up.  This is mainly a duty and service. 
S: Are you confident in victory? 
Z: If I wasn't confident, I wouldn't wouldn't have donned this uniform and taken up arms. I'm confident! It's impossible to fight without it. 
S: What impacted you most in your life? 
Z: Character is formed in childhood thanks to your mom and dad, school, and the Homeland. What has impacted me, or awoken, rather than shocked me? The events of late 2013-early 2014. The Maidan. I was awakened by what is called the Russian soul. I was scared and offended that we, Russians, were perceived as second-class people. 
So then I took up arms and decided that if they don't understand the easy way, then they need to be explained the hard way. I was sick and tired of being a second-class citizen. I live on my land, and yet there was the sense that I am an outcast. This awoke that feeling in me. 
They started to burn churches, set deputies on fire, and march around Kiev with Nazi flags and torches. I asked myself: 'For what did our grandfathers die? What about our great grandfathers? Only for this scum to come to my hometown and say that we are all outcasts?" This is probably what awakened me to another life. 
S: People are interested in what is going on with the war and with peace in Donbass. 
Z: I'll let you in on a big secret: there is no peace here! We have a raging war. But public opinion is that today the peace process is ongoing, and that they're trying to solve the problem peacefully. It is impossible to speak about any peace with those beasts that are now half a kilometer away from us.  
S: What would you tell people in Russia? 
Z: I've said this earlier and I can say it again. Thank you,  Homeland! Thank you, Russian people! Thank you, that I had the honor to be born in this country and that its blood flows in my veins. 
And I would also like to ask: Countrymen, what needs to be done for us to return home? What needs to be done so that, finally, the millions of Russian people who live here can return there whence we all came?  
S: I saw that you have the flag of Russia in your office.  

Z: Yes, of course. The flag of the Donetsk People's Republic - this is my land - and the flag of Russia - the flag of the Homeland. I was born in Donetsk, therefore the flag of Donbass stands. And Russia is my Homeland. Thus, I have to flags.

Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Mikhail Saakashvili's governorship of Odessa was an insult to the Ukrainian people. 
"This was simply a slap and insult to Odessans and the whole Ukrainian people. He couldn't even get a working visa to the US and the universities he tried to find work at didn't want to employ him in a permanent job. This means that he can't fulfill the duties of being the governor of Odessa. And what, are there no decent, professional, and capable Ukrainians for such a job?', Putin said in an interview with Oliver Stone for the documentary 'Ukraine in Flames.' 

In early November, Saakashvili announced his intention to resign from the post of governor of the Odessa region over the unwillingness of Ukrainian authorities to fight against corruption. He also blamed Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko for patronizing criminal clans in the region.

- Ronald ZONCA , in Boulevard Voltaire, translated by Tom Winter -   

It has to be said: the International Criminal Court is just another means of repression and oppression of sovereign peoples. 
Russia has just signified its withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC) in view of its inefficiency and its partiality in choosing what to investigate. A reading of the "Report on Preliminary Examination Activities in 2016" proves that it's a matter of justice by fiat. 

The case of Ukraine is particularly revealing. This country is not a signatory to the Rome Statute and therefore does not recognize the ICC. But it intervenes on complaints filed by the current government, even though the current government came out of a coup d'etat. 

The investigations concern only the snipers of the MaÃ¯dan, the Donbass, and the Crimea. There were no investigations into the Odessa fire, where 50 people were burnt alive, nor on the cut-off of water and electricity in the Crimea, which could be described as a crime against humanity. 

The case of Ukraine's winter power cut deserves our attention. 

This has done serious injury to the inhabitants of Crimea because it means an end to water distribution, the pumps being inoperative, and to heating, as the boilers can not function. Responsibility for this cut is claimed by Tatar activists. The leaders of these activists are not only not prosecuted but are heard on allegations of abuse of the Crimean Tatars. 

Let us recall that Crimean Tatars also live in the Crimea and have suffered the consequences of cuts in electricity and water. 

Among the few convictions, the MiloÅ¡eviÄ‡ case is exemplary. He is a man who suffered eleven years of pre-trial detention, died in suspicious prison conditions, and who has just been cleared this year by the same court that sentenced him. 

Though the ICC aspires to world jurisdiction, given that major states such as China, India, and Russia are not or are no longer signatories to the Rome Statute that founded the ICC, the legitimacy of this body is therefore only Western. African states such as South Africa, Guinea and Burundi have left the institution, tired of seeing Africa hosting all the ICC field offices. The New York office acts in a liaison role, not to say a directory, nor an investigative role. 

The ICC, the UN, the IMF and other institutions of coercion fulfill their missions. These institutions were created by the US, for the US, and they support them in their attempt to dominate the world. 

The peoples are no longer able to turn away from the values of humanism, justice, the right to self-determination, and they see multipolarity as a prerequisite for existence and independence. A free world is first and foremost a multipolar world. 

The United States is a great nation. Paraphrasing Churchill, we can say that i f other nations are ready to learn from this great and respectable people, they do not intend to be taught every day. 

After 14 years of operation, it is clear that the ICC is just one more organ for the repression and oppression of sovereign peoples.

- Berliner Morgenpost , the complete interview, translated by Tom Winter -   


In Merzig. Sahra Wagenknecht loves the idyllic nature of Saarland. "This is the opposite to hectic Berlin, ideal for relaxing," she says. With Oskar Lafontaine, her husband, she often gets on her bike. "When we have time, we bicycle a good 100 kilometers a day." 
Merzig, a small town on the border with France, has become the new home of the 47-year-old, who was born in Jena, has her constituency in DÃ¼sseldorf, and leads the left-wing fraction in the Bundestag. In a cafÃ© at the town hall, Wagenknecht sketched out her goals for the election year. 
--- Ms Wagenknecht, you and your co-chairman Dietmar Bartsch were for a long time like Tom and Jerry. Could you be a successful candidate for the Bundestag election? 

Sahra Wagenknecht: We have been successfully running the Bundestag campaign for more than a year now. The Left is now highr in all surveys than in 2013, despite the strength of the AfD. The climate in the faction has also improved. There is a relationship of trust between Dietmar Bartsch and myself, we work well together. This is the prerequisite for a successful election campaign. 

What is the purpose of the Linkspartei? 

Wagenknecht: My wish for the Bundestag election is a clear signal that the same-old same-old of the grand coalition will be voted out and the social question finally comes to the agenda. For years inequality has grown in Germany, many people can no longer live by their labor,and more and more the elderly are humiliated with poverty. 

But voting AfD doesn't change this, because AfD also advocates a weak social state and privatization. A good double-digit result for the left would put the other parties, especially the SPD, under pressure to finally take care of the social interests of the majority. 

You again rely on tax increases. What must happen before the Left thinks about the relief of citizens and businesses? 

Wagenknecht: We demand tax reductions for the majority, namely middle-income and low-income earners. It is scandalous that an income tax rate of 24 percent will be payable from an income of 1140 Euro, while companies like Apple, Amazon or Starbucks in Europe will be hit with tax rates of 0.005 percent. 

It is perfectly understandable that people feel they're over a barrel by such a policy. We want the large companies and super-rich people to pay appropriate taxes. We demand, among other things, a millionaires' tax and the regular taxation of large inheritances. 

"SPD has been making policies against its own voters for years" 

In the polls, even enough a red-green-green triple bundle won't go. What power perspective do you see? 

Wagenknecht: It's not enough because the SPD has been doing politicies against its own voters for years. Why should workers and retirees choose a party that has created a huge low wage sector and destroyed the statutory pension. Sigmar Gabriel has recently fought like a lion for the CTE Group Protection Agreement. In the inheritance tax, he was undisturbed by Horst Seehofer. As long as the SPD does not signal that it wants something else than a more-of-the-same, the voters are running away. 

Under what conditions would you be willing to co-ordinate with the SPD and Greens? 

Wagenknecht: The basic direction of politics must change: the SPD and the Greens have been part of the inglorious party cartel that has destroyed the welfare state. We want to restore the welfare state. We do not need a Riester-Schwachsinn, which makes only the financial industry rich, but a sufficient legal pension. Everyone must pay for this, including self-employed persons, civil servants and politicians. 

We need decent unemployment insurance again. In addition, the bargaining with temps and out-contracting has to end. In foreign policy, Germany should return to the tradition of a back-off policy ... 

... by which you mean? 

Wagenknecht: Balancing interests instead of escalating conflicts through rearmament and war. The so-called war against terror did not make this world more peaceful, instead it ultimately strengthened terrorism - and brought it to Germany. Taking the Bundeswehr out of Afghanistan and Syria would be the best thing we could do for our security.  

It doesn't sound like you're going to govern. 

Wagenknecht: What? For more than 40 years, the Federal Republic did well to keep its soldiers home. For Willy Brandt war was the "ultima irratio," thus no road for politics. If the SPD today characgerizes such positions as "non-governmental," this is a sad testimony to their own decline. 

"Germany is not defended in Afghanistan" 

Should the termination of all foreign operations of the Bundeswehr be agreed upon before signing a coalition agreement? 

Wagenknecht: If we help poor countries after catastrophes, drill wells, or build schools, this is welcome. But it does not call for a Bundeswehr. The Technical Aid Organization, better equipped, would suffice. The Left will never support the military effort of the Bundeswehr. They are also contrary to the Basic Law. The task of the Bundeswehr is to defend Germany. Germany is not defended either in Mali, Afghanistan, or Syria. 

Would Sigmar Gabriel as an SPD chancellor candidate be an argument for or rather against red-red-green?   

Wagenknecht: If I were a leading SPD politician, I would give a thought to the result of the US election. The Democrats hindered the left-profiled Bernie Sanders, only to suffer with an unbelievable Hillary Clinton shipwreck. Clinton stood for arbitrariness, venality, and indifference to the social division of the country. Many have chosen Trump because they wanted to deselect this more-of-the-same. I think the SPD should take this seriously. 

Who is the SPD's Bernie Sanders? 

Wagenknecht: Well. If Mr. Gabriel, keep looking! In a large party like the SPD, there must be genuine Social Democrats who are credible in the eyes of voters. Sigmar Gabriel, on the other hand, stands for the politics since the turn of the millennium, that is, for the SPD aligning itself with the economically powerful - leaving its traditional voters in the lurch. 

Some utterances from the Linkspartei sound as if they came from the AfD. Do you want to recapture the voters who have migrated to the right-wing populists? 

Wagenknecht: Of course, we want to win every voter who is angry and angry about the growing injustices. The fact that the AfD has reached such voters at all is only because it pretends to be committed to their social interests. But if you look at the program of the AfD, it sounds more like the economic wing of the CDU / CSU or the FDP. Merkel has handed the AfD many voters through her haphazard refugee policy. It would be irresponsible to deal with it. 

You yourself said after the New Year's Eve events at Cologne's main station: "Whoever abuses his rights as a guest forfeits them." That could also come from the AfD chairman Petry   

...Wagenknecht: ... or from politicians of the SPD and the CDU / CSU, all of whom have also said it. I have not repeated this sentence because it's been misunderstood. But the claim, that all who live in Germany - refugees and natives - must accept the local rules and laws, is not AfD, but reason.

November 21, 2016 -  By Eduard Popov for Fort Russ - translated by J. Arnoldski - 


On November 21st, Ukrainian President Poroshenko admitted that Ukrainians' quality of life has not improved over the three years since the events on the Maidan and is still far from European standards. However, he did find an excuse for his failed economic policies, explaining the failures of Ukraine's economy by 'objective factors' and the need to spend more than 5% of GDP on 'the defense and security sector and the creation of a new army.'  
In addition, Poroshenko tried to shift the blame onto his predecessors, saying that economic reforms necessary to ensure the necessary growth of the economy had not been pursued in the country for a long time. 
The Euromaidan, as we remember, stood under one main slogan: joining the EU, which the 'criminal regime' of President Yanukovych hindered. After nearly 3 years since the victory of the Maidan and the overthrow of the 'criminal' government, no one is waiting for Ukraine in the EU and Ukrainians' living standards have declined dramatically. 
Poroshenko, however, still found positive changes in the life of Ukraine. A bit earlier, on November 20th, he stated that for the first time in several years, namely after 14 quarters of decline, the country noted a growth in the economy. He called the International Monetary Fund's aid to the Ukrainian state the defining moment behind this. Moreover, Poroshenko promised to significantly raise wages in the near future, particularly for doctors, teachers, and other public sector workers. Poroshenko compared the Ukrainian economy with a patient finally leaving the hospital and going on the mend.  
Ukraine's economy is, in my opinion, most likely not recovering, but is a stably critically ill patient. If any improvements happen, then they affect only certain industries that have very little growth. If we take longer periods and the entire economy as a whole, then the Ukrainian economy does not demonstrate any positive outlook. This was recognized by the ex-governor of the Odessa region, Mikhail Saakashvili, according to whom Ukraine needs at least 15 years to regain the level of development it had under President Yanukovych. Poroshenko's promises that the money provided by the IMF will bring social benefits sound like pure populism, or more like demagoguery.  
The IMF loan is too relatively small to have any significant impact on the macroeconomic situation in this country of 40 million (according to inflated official figures) with a depressed economy and enormous social burden (over 12 million Ukrainians are pensioners).  
Ukrainian experts themselves have noted that the lion's share of the loan will go, first of all, to service debt, and, secondly, to infrastructural reform. Ukraine will see no real spending money from the IMF, as such is largely means provided to service debt problems. Poroshenko, like an experienced businessman setting up a new business, is openly lying when he says otherwise. 
A number of Ukrainian experts suggest that the IMF money is needed by Kiev for political concerns. When getting money, the government never forgets to remind everyone that as long as the loans are coming in, this means that the West has not ditched them.  
As calculated by the executive director of Blazer International Fund, Oleg Ustenko, Kiev is already forced to allocate 5% of its entire GDP to covering debt. In order for the economy to show growth, it would have to grow at a rate above 5%, otherwise GDP will decline.  

Poroshenko also compared the reforms supposedly underway in Ukraine to those carried out in Central and Eastern European countries. This analogy makes sense. The results of these reforms, which liberal experts consider successful, essentially transitioned the economies and financial systems of the socialist camp countries to the control of Western companies and transnational corporations. Therein, the countries of the former socialist camp lost their economic sovereignty.  
When Poroshenko compares supposedly successful reforms in Ukraine with the 'successful' reforms in these European countries, he is right in only one  aspect: Ukrainians too will lose  their right to their own property and resources.

-  Mikhail KOTOV  in LIFE.ru, translated by Tom Winter - 

Foreign shores: why the Russian military base in Syria 

Viktor Ozerov, Chairman of the Defense and Security Committee of the Federation Council, told RIA "Novosti" that the base in Tartus should become a full-fledged overseas base of the Russian Navy in half to two years after the signing of the agreement on it and its ratification. "Proceeding from his impression of the base, and of plans to improve infrastructure, which we reported to the leadership of our group in Syria, I can say that we are not going to put off the modernization of Tartus, with the most modern requirements," said Ozerov.  

LIFE's journalist Mikhail Kotov understands why Russia needs this base. 

We're leaving, we're leaving, we're leaving 

For two decades, the Russian military presence in the world has consistently been declining. Beginning with the last years of the Soviet Union there have been fewer military bases under the red and then white-blue-red flag on the map. Since 1972, as if someone had started a countdown: the Egyptian Port Said, Berbera, Nosra. In 1991 Russians left the military bases in Germany (Rostock), Germany, and the Polish one at Swinoujscie. In 2002, Russia lost its naval base at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam, and after the beginning of the "Arab Spring" had to hastily withdraw troops from Tripoli in Libya. Against the background of a gradual retraction -- that didn't slow the growth of NATO for a minute, it seemed an utter loss. 

And now the statement of the Council of Federation of the Defense and Security Committee and the previously announced Ministry of Defense plans sound like a bombshell. Is this a new renaissance of Russian troops, or just one of the episodes of the Syrian conflict? Do we need this base? Can we keep it? To find answers to these questions, it is necessary to go back and try to understand on what the principles in the world such military outposts exist in the territory of other countries. 

Echoes of war  

The newfound bipolar world was clearly manifested already in the last days of World War II. The threat, which temporarily united countries, was destroyed, and it became clear that there is a "we" and "they." And let no one be misled by the triumvirate of leaders at the Yalta Conference, the world is henceforth split in two. NATO, created in 1949 and the countries of the Warsaw Pact, concluded six years later, began struggling to make friends against each other. 


The more active a country's foreign policy is, the more it needs assistants in all corners of the world. Not for overt fighting, rather for denoting the presence and serving as an active extension of diplomatic aspirations. [Suppose] a satellite falls in the wrong place, an uprising starts in a friendly contry, intelligence calls for support -- All these questions are much easier to solve, if you have at hand a military base closed to prying eyes. Naturally, they were differently assigned: in Cuba, the Soviet Union had the radio-electronic center and in Vietnam [the base was a] pied-a-terre for the logistics fleet. 
Of course, that the Soviet Union was not the only country seeking to extend the hands of the military. The United States of America created their own bases no less actively. At the same time the United States managed an almost unprecedented situation: they do not pay for the land leased by the base, almost anywhere. Instead it is represented as a contribution to the host country's overall security. More than thirty countries, more than one hundred sites around the world. Maximum operating room. 
Do not think that in each of these countries the locals are just happy to see the Yankees. The main example - the naval base in Okinawa. The island was captured by US troops in 1945, and since then, the US military base is almost 18 percent of its territory. The local population, whom the "invaders" treat as second-class citizens, regularly go to protests and demonstrations.  
In total since 1972 in Okinawa, the US Army was committed 5,800 crimes, 571 of which can be categorized as serious. E.g, in 1995, twelve Japanese schoolgirls were raped by US soldiers. And nothing - the military presence is more important. 
Understood, of course, that it is not that way everywhere; many European countries, including the Baltic republics, are themselves willing to provide territory for overseas military deployment. A key factor in this is skillful American diplomatic work, and many regularly asserting about possible aggression from Russia. 
Return to former position 
Military bases should not be taken as an outpost of the country, where one might expect an attack any time. In most cases (especially when we are talking about Russia) it is only the indicator of strength and presence in the region. But the main goal - a logistics center, giving the opportunity for a quick response to any problem that might arise in the region. So another way to think of them in Soviet times: a group of military advisors and specialists. They maintain the presence, but at the same time the money spent for the maintenance of such a mobile group is much less. 
In many ways, such numerically small bases relate to the lack of funding. Even the budget of the USSR was greatly strained, containing all the foreign assistance centers, to say nothing of Russia. That is why a return to the old policy has caused so much talk. 
By itself, a military base in Syria (officially the 720th logistics of the Russian Navy) was established to support the Soviet naval operations in the Mediterranean, namely the repair of ships and vessels of the 5th Mediterranean operational squadron, with their fuel supply, water and consumables. Founded in 1971, it has never been particularly great, just a few berths and facilities on the territory of the Syrian naval base (63 brigades of the Syrian Navy crew). 
Russian portions of Syrian Naval base marked in red. 

After 1992, when the Soviet Mediterranean Squadron, which was created as a visible and tangible rival the US Sixth Fleet, was disbanded, there began a slow fadeout of the base. In the best years more than two thousand soldiers and sailors, with marines guarding. In 2002, there were only 50 military personnel on the base, and by 2012 this number was down to only four people. 

After the beginning of the participation of Russian armed forces in the Syrian civil war, the base contingent increased again. In 2015, it amounted to 1,700 people, who assisted in unloading, ship supply, and repair, and the delivery of Russian military hardware to Syria. Therefore, to talk about the creation of the base is not entirely correct, but rather, it has been a return. 

A Base without a squadron 


Geographically, Russia does not have normal access to the Mediterranean. The only way to leave the enclosed Black Sea is through the Turkish Bosporus Strait, the Sea of Marmara and then the Dardanelles, and then exit to the operating space of the Mediterranean. But, firstly, the outlet of all ships through the Bosporus is tightly controlled by Turkey, a NATO member, and, secondly, the passage of vessels costs money. The Turkish side collects the so-called "light dues" for passage through the strait, depending on the vessel class. Sometimes it can reach significant values. That is why the Russian bases in the Mediterranean are needed even in the absence of a permanent fleet in the region. 

There have been discussions in the Naval Command about the desire to revive in full the base in Libya (Tripoli), which lasted until 2011. But the current political situation pushed the process of returning to the Mediterranean with the Syrian base. It is expected that after the modernizations are finished, it will be able to accommodate large vessels. In addition to direct military purposes, the base in Tartus is of great importance for external intelligence operations, including electronic ones. 

Accounts and mutual settlements   

It remains a question of the cost of all this. Most likely, in view of the current relations between Russia and the Government of Bashar al-Assad, rent at Tartus will be zero. As regards the funds that will be spent from the budget on the presence of Russian troops and support staff in Syria, earlier the Ministry of Finance decided to increase the relevant articles of the Russian budget to 678 billion rubles. It is highly likely that the money will be used to service the Russian naval base. 

In addition, screenshots from Syrian TV recently appeared on the networks. In them one might well discern medium range Russian air-to-air missiles, RVV-AE (R-77). This means that Russia has quietly upgraded Syrian MiG-29 to the MiG-29SM variant. These missiles can hit an air target at speeds of up to Mach 3. The cost of each of these missiles is very high. In 2012, Malaysia bought 35 missiles RVV-AE for US $ 35 million. It is possible that this upgrade is also an integral part of the Russian-Syrian relations that resulted in the revival of the naval base in Tartus. 
SyAAF MiG-29 armed with R-77!!!!


Back in the saddle? 

Speaking frankly, one base in the Mediterranean without a constant fleet in the Mediterranean doesn't work. This step does not carry with it geopolitical changes. Those who wish can consider the composition of the United States Sixth Fleet, to understand that we will not threaten them from Tartus, separately, in no way. 

Rather, it is a sign for the world and NATO, showing that Russia wants to return to the world stage and that its aspirations do not end with the borders of the CIS, where most Russian foreign military bases are now.  

However, it should be remembered that, by investing in Tartus, Russia once and for all stands with Assad, is not trying to be above the situation, but is clearly taking one side of the game. Indeed, in the case of a Syrian Government defeat, this base would go the way of the base in Tripoli, which had to quickly fold in 2011 after the beginning of the "Arab Spring" and the death of Muammar Gaddafi. 

This is a risky bet, but in the case of a successful conclusion of the war in Syria, it could be a serious step on the way of Russia's return to big geopolitics. Military action - this is just a continuation of political aspirations, and if the base is such a handy instrument, it should be used.

Half of the weapons that the international anti-terrorist coalition headed by the US drops from the air over Syria end up in the hands of the terrorist grouping known as the Islamic State, or Daesh, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has stated. 
'The question of fighting terrorism needs to be asked first and foremost to the West. We are now fighting against Daesh. The US periodically provides air support but, unfortunately, we see weapons of Western manufacturing in Daesh hands. Of course, the Americans don't say that they are supporting Daesh, but we see that half of the weapons dropped from their aircraft go to Syrian Kurds, and the other half to Daesh,' the Turkish head of state said in an interview to Second Israeli TV channel. 

Ankara remains opposed to the US' support for Syrian kurds.

November 22, 2016 -  Deena Stryker, Katehon -  


In 1944, against a groundswell of concern for the democratic process, FDR ran and won a fourth presidential term, because Americans did not want an untried leader in the midst of two wars. (Unfortunately, Roosevelt died soon after that election, leaving President Truman to formulate the disastrous American policy toward the Soviet Union that brought us Cold Wars I and II.) 
Today, FDR's presidency would probably be considered 'authoritarian': he pretended not to see Japan preparing to attack Pearl Harbor, so that shocked Americans would finally be willing to declare war on both Japan and Germany. He is famous for packing the Supreme Court, and although they were milder than would have wanted the Progressive Movement, he wrung workers' rights and protections out of Congress by signaling to his advisors 'Make me do it.' He is still revered today, while one of the polities that ranks highest on key governance criteria is Singapore, a tiny, multi-ethnic country led by the same man for four decades. 
After achieving independence from Great Britain, Lee Kuan Yew moved Singapore's Third World economy to First World affluence in a single generation. According to Wikileaks: 'Lee Kuan Yew's emphasis on rapid economic growth, support for business entrepreneurship, and limitations on internal democracy shaped Singapore's policies for the next half-century. Freedom House ranks Singapore as "partly free' and The Economist ranks it as a "flawed democracy", however the ruling party gets 83 of 89 seats with 70% of the popular vote, while in the mid-eighties, Gallup reported Singaporeans' confidence in the government and judicial system among the highest in the world. 
Although Singapore ranks among the top countries for "order and security", "absence of corruption", and "effective criminal justice,' gatherings of five or more people require police permits, and protests may legally be held only at the Speakers' Corner. Yet, this multi-lingual (English, Chinese and Hindu), country is among the top internationally in education and government supported health care. Although the system can only be classified as authoritarian, there is absolutely zero chance that a US president will declare that its leader 'has to go'. That is because like Europe, it combines entre-preneurship with socialist citizen protections. 
Today, 'authoritarianism' is applied equally to the Saudi Arabian monarchy, where women are not allowed to drive, much less legislate, to China, where the Communist Party watches over the biggest ever economic miracle, and to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Interestingly, it was not applied to Dmitri Medvedev when he was President (Vladimir Putin serving as his Prime Minister). Medvedev was referred to as 'a man we can work with' '”and even as 'Our man in the Kremlin'. 
At home, however, his 'Atlanticist', neo-liberal faction is referred to by Putin supporters, who cherish their social protections and believe the state should be in charge of a nation's key sources of wealth, as a 'fifth column'. 
What was the state of Russia when Vladimir Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin, America's first 'man in the Kremlin'? 
Putin first won election in 2000, three months after Yeltsin's resignation for ill health. At forty-eight, thanks to his steadfastness as a KGB officer, then as advisor on international affairs to the mayor of St Petersburg, as head of the KGB, then Prime Minister to Boris Yeltsin (a president famous for his drunken displays), Putin was his designated successor at a time when Russia was in a shambles. 
Its crown jewels had been privatized at rock bottom prices to a group of men who became known as 'the oligarchs'. State employees weren't getting their paychecks on time '” if at all '” and virtually nothing had been done to build a fair liberal '”or social democratic '” system ten years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. (When Vladimir Putin declared that this event had been a catastrophe, he was not, as the Western press implies, alluding to the demise of Communism, but to the terrible social conditions in which rabid privatization left most Russians.) 
Putin is invariably tagged as a 'former KGB officer' by US journalists, who conveniently forget that the first President Bush ran the CIA for a year. The truth is that the Russian president's wide-ranging jobs prepared him well for the challenge of reviving the largest country in the world, home to 160 ethnic groups speaking some 100 languages and practicing four different religions, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism and Islam'”(estimates for this latter ranging from 5 - 14%). 
The Western media claims that President Putin's 80%+ ratings reflect a herd mentality, the result of centuries of autocratic rule under the Mongols (four centuries), the Tsars and the Communist Party. In reality, unbeknownst to most Americans, today's Russians enjoy individualist lifestyles, vacations abroad and the latest cars. 
For twenty centuries, the lure of Athenian democracy (in which only free males participated) increased in tandem with the power of Kings. But applying democracy has proved ever more difficult as populations and threats grew larger. As he prepares to leave office after eight years of Republican refusal to cooperate with his laudable projects, I suspect President Obama, like most other Western heads of state, secretly envies Putin his ability to get things done. 
When I was in Cuba in 1964, Fidel Castro was being billed in the US as a dictator. I asked then president Osvaldo Dorticos whether or not he agreed that it was risky to have a 'king', since one could never know whether inherited leadership would be good or bad. (The outside world did not know that the Cuban government was already experimenting with various forms of local democracy.) Today around the world, 'the people' are still impotent to prevent worsening economic conditions '” and even war, which first fills the coffers of arms makers, then of industry, needed to rebuild what war has destroyed. Yet Raul Castro has overseen a transition toward a form of national participatory democracy, and Putin appears to be encouraging the same approach in Russia. Meanwhile, in the West it becomes increasingly difficult to affirm that free and fair elections guarantee efficient government or popular satisfaction. 
In the complex 21st century world, peace and prosperity are probably best achieved when strong central governments jointly deal with global challenges, while participatory local governments oversee domestic affairs. (Iceland, a country so sparsely populated that almost everyone knows everyone else, is successfully applying this system.) 

Although he has been elected 'fair and square', Donald Trump may not make it into the White House, whence he, together with Putin and Xi could move toward a multi-polar world organized along those lines. Guided by 'an invisible hand', thousands of people protest the neo-fascist, misogynist, racist president who defeated his neo-fascist rival preparing for nuclear-war against Russia, and whose backers, unlike the protesters, have the means to once again implement the 'ultimate solution' against an American president.

November 23rd, 2016 - Fort Russ -  Alexander Dugin, Katehon - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


This week, a very important delegation from Turkey visited Moscow. The group consists of members of the Turkish parliament and representatives of the ruling party, big business, and non-governmental organizations. At the head of the delegation is the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's cousin, Mehmet Mutlu, one of the most influential figures in modern Turkey. From the standpoint of diplomatic symbolism, the most important part of this trip is the delegation's visit to Crimea, which starts today, November 23rd. 
We've seen Russian Crimea visited by many European politicians, including Italians from Matteo Salvini's Northern League, Frenchmen from Marine Le Pen's National Front and the Republican Party, deputies from the Alternative for Germany party, and many others. Conservative European politicians have no doubt: Crimea is part of Russia. This is a kind of consensus. In fact, in addition to right wing politicians, this position is shared by left politicians as well, such as the fearless Sahra Wagenknecht from Germany's Die Linke and Italian politicians from the Five Stars party.  
But the high-ranking Turkish delegation's visit to Russia Crimea is already a completely new stage. Once again, we are dealing with a delegation involving Turkey's ruling party and the closest companion and relative of Erdogan. In essence, this is a decisive step towards Ankara's recognition of Crimea's reunification with Russia. It is telling that this is happening synchronously with Erdogan's statements that Turkey is suspending the process of integrating into Europe - where, by the way, no one is waiting for Turkey or will accept it - and Turkey's reorienting towards the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.  
Erdogan is determined to change the country's Atlanticist course for a Eurasian one. Following the scare of the Gulenists' coup attempt, this determination has become even stronger. The American swamp stabbed Erdogan in the back. With the arrival of Trump, who is highly critical of Ankara, the situation has not defused. Therefore, Erdogan is clearly opting for rapprochement with us, and this is already irreversible. A symbol of this determination is the Turks' visit to Crimea. Russian Crimea.  
We saw how the forces of the West who staged the coup d'etat on the Maidan in 2014 and unleashed a bloody civil war in Ukraine tried to play the Crimean Tatar card in their favor. This provocative, extremist, nationalist, Wahhabist trend has come to be embodied in Mustafa Dzhemiliev. The objective of Kiev, and the West (or rather, the Western globalist swamp) standing behind it, was to mobilize Crimean Tatars against Russia. But Crimean Tatars themselves did not succumb to this provocation. In addition, Moscow almost immediately did what Kiev didn't do over 20 years: recognize the rights of Crimean Tatars. 
The majority of Crimean Tatars live in Turkey and are deeply and organically integrated into Turkish society. Therefore, even given Tatars' loyalty to Moscow after the reunification of Crimea with Russia, the Turkey factor remains extremely important. Even though Turkish President Erdogan has never spoken out against Russia's reunification with Crimea, he has never clarified his attitude towards Crimea or Crimean Tatars.  
And now, in front of our very eyes, is happening this visit, which is historic in every sense of the word. The aim of the visit is setting up active and intense social and commercial relations between the Turkish Republic and Russian Crimea. This says it all. It is obvious that Ankara decided on the composition of this delegation only after having well weighed all the consequences. The visit itself was made possible on the condition of agreeing on Crimea's status and the future of its official recognition.  
It is telling that one of the leaders of the delegation, Hasan Cengiz, the head of an influential Turkish Eurasianist NGO, recently visited Damascus and held talks with Bashar al-Assad's entourage. These were the first talks since the beginning of the conflict between Syria and Turkey. The choice of the delegation's members was and is not accidental.  
Therefore, we can conclude that the process of Russian Crimea being recognized is gaining momentum in both the West and the East. Turkey is in the vanguard here.  

The Eurasian strategy removes almost all the contradictions that accumulated between neighboring countries in past periods. Turkey, like Russia, is undoubtedly a Eurasian country. And now this is becoming all the more obvious.

Banana Republics: The Baltics' #1 export, Russophobia, is running out of demand... November 22, 2016 - Fort Russ - Ruslan Ostashko, PolitRussia - translated by J. Arnoldski - Dear friends, have you noticed that our opposition which has gone to the Baltic states really loves to to talk about how nice it is for the people there to live in the European Union? Some even periodically praise the local economy which, in contrast to the 'torn to shreds gas station,' has long since rushed into the post-industrial era and doesn't need oil, gas, industry, or even developed agriculture to be prosperous. The inquisitive reader may ask: on what is the foundation of Baltic economic pleasantry based? Indeed, this pleasantry is doubtful, seeing as how the citizens of these countries are fleeing and the economy has yet to recover since the financial crisis. And this is not to mention that numerous officials from the Baltic countries are experiencing a certain pessimism as to the economic future of these countries. Well, okay, let's assume that there was once such a success story and try to explain on what it was based. If you think about it, something rather interesting is explained here. There is one overriding article in Baltic exports which was not taken into account in any economic checkbook or the reports of the IMF or European Commission. This, of course, is Russophobia. Who needs manufacturing if every day you can just talk about a Russian invasion? Who needs developed agriculture if officials from the Baltics can tell stories about Putin's plans to seize Riga? Who needs an economy at all if it is more profitable to sell votes at the meetings of European organs of power? In exchange for Russophobia, they can receive diplomatic support, structural funds from the European Union, and the deployment of additional NATO troops. They can even get real money for anti-Russian propaganda, some of which, by the way, makes its way into the hands of the Russian opposition journalists and activists who are so fond of the weather in the Baltic states. Russophobia is an all-around perfect export product. To be produced, it needs only two things: Russia, which will never disappear, and a Baltic official or journalist who complains about Russia, is afraid of Russia, and urgently needs protection from Russia. This is the perpetual motion machine. No wonder many Latvian and Estonian Russophobes thought that they had found a gold mine that never runs out. But now a surprise has come. The demand for Russophobia has fallen with the ascent of Trump. Even the Western champions of Russophobic discourse are preparing to tighten their belts and switch to eating only buckwheat, not to mention their Baltic colleagues. This situation could run the economy of the former 'Baltic tigers' and especially the personal futures of many Russophobic politicians into problems more serious than the global financial crisis. The Latin American banana republics had this kind of bad luck when prices fell for bananas, and then political chaos began since they didn't produce anything other than bananas. Something similar is happening in this case, only it is not the price for bananas that is falling, but the price for Russophobia. Soros and his friends where generous when they had access to the purse of the State Department or US Congress, but they are much less gracious with their own money, so some will have to chew on their tie instead of eating red caviar sandwiches. And some kind of Maidan is not far off, or suddenly some Baltic version of Dodon could win elections. The authorities of our northwestern neighbors have something to be sad about. But what can they do? Those few politicians that kept some common sense are somehow trying to restore economic relations with Russia and are even flying to Moscow, but this looks pathetic. What kind of salvation by Russian transit can there be if Russia has already, for a long time and consciously, been contributing to the creation of port facilities on the Baltic Sea in order to stop paying these Russophobic border states? The squeezing of their products out of the Russian market is only a matter of time, and this is an inevitable process, just as inevitable as the death of Baltic transit. And what will happen then? Then they will beg us to take the Baltic states. They will beg for a pro-Russian Maidan to be organized, and local officials will even want to lead it. But this won't happen. Everyone will understand that being with Russia in a single economic space is something that has to be earned. Thus, the Baltic Russophobes have little hope. Follow us on Facebook!

Three servicemen of the Turkish army were killed yesterday as a result of a Syrian airstrike in the Aleppo province,  the Turkish newspaper HÃ¼rriyet has reported citing the Turkish General Staff. The bombardment also injured 10 of Ankara's soldiers. 
On Thursday, November 24th, an airstrike by Syrian military aviation with Turkish troops as its target was recorded for the first time since the beginning of Turkey's illegal Euphrates Shield operation on the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic.  
Since August 24th, Erdogan's forces have been engaged in operation Euphrates Shield in the Aleppo province without agreement from the government of Syria. The declared goal of the military operation is the clearing out of ISIS terrorists from the northern regions of Syria adjacent to Turkey. Many experts have called the real objective of the operation to be fighting against armed Kurdish groups. 
A military source has reported to Russian Spring that the strike hit Turkish occupation units in the vicinity of Al-Bab, where they, together with members of the bandit formation known as the Free Syrian Army, are attacking Kurds and ISIS.  
'Before the strike, the troops received several warnings that Syrian Air Force planes would bomb rebel positions north of Al-Bab. They were supposed to leave this territory of Syria,' the source said. 

Yesterday was the anniversary of the death of Russian air force pilot Oleg Peshkov and marine Alexander Pozynich, who were killed by Turkish military operations and pro-Turkish militants in Syrian Latakia.

European Parliament suspends negotiations with Turkey on EU membership November 24, 2016 - Fort Russ News - RIA Novosti - translated by J. Arnoldski - At a plenary session in Strasbourg, the European Parliament approved a resolution calling on the EU to suspend negotiations on Turkey's membership over the actions of the Turkish authorities. The head of European diplomacy, Federica Mogherini, said during a debate in the European Parliament session that relations between Ankara and the EU are at a crossroads and that 'the transition from rhetoric to action on the issue of the death penalty will be a signal that Turkey does not want to be a member of the European family, nor the Council of Europe, nor the European Union.' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stated on Wednesday that the adoption of the resolution means nothing to Turkey. Commenting on the results of the vote in the European Parliament, the Turkish Minister for EU Affairs, Omer Celik, said that 'while Turkey, due to threats from Syria and Iraq, is undergoing a difficult period in the fight against terrorism, unfortunately, short-sided and one-sided discussions are happening in Europe.' Brussels has repeatedly asserted that Ankara's behavior calls into question its desire to join the bloc. In early November, in its yearly report on Turkey's progress on the road to joining the EU, the European Commission highlighted Ankara's failures in policy in the fields of civil society, human rights, and freedom of speech. The report also noted that Turkey's authorities are not doing enough to bring legislation in line with European norms. The agreement on association between the European community and Turkey was signed in 1963. Ankara applied for membership in 1987. However, negotiations on joining the EU, which began only in 2005, have repeatedly been complicated by disagreements that have now led to their suspension. Now only 16 out of 35 chapters of the negotiation file on Turkey joining the EU are open. In March 2016, the leaders of EU member countries agreed to intensify negotiations in exchange for Ankara's agreement to contribute to reducing the influx of migrants to Europe via Turkish territory.

Donetsk 25 Nov 2016 The program of the third day of visit of the French group was totally turned around by the always moving news of the Donbass. That was the day of the funeral commemoration of Commander Motorola, murdered three days earlier during a bomb attack in the elevator of his building.  

Our visitors took part in this moving ceremony, placing flowers near his coffin, and joining the people gathered in the center of Donetsk to bid farewell to one of the most emblematic and well-known commanders of the People's Republic of Donetsk (RPD). 



They saw with their own eyes the incredible number of ordinary citizens who came to pay homage to this hero of the republic. The first approximate figures of 30,000 people were adjusted later to at least 50,000 people who were there to bid farewell and show their attachment to this commander who had come to help the people of Donbass to defend their freedom. 

Billboards were installed in the city center with the photo of Commander Motorola and the phrase "Heroes do not die." It was only proper that we go immediately after the funeral to the high place of commemoration of the heroes fallen for the defense of freedom: the hill of Saur Mogila. What better place than this height, twice the subject of intense fighting, and twice retaken at great cost by soldiers defending freedom, to ponder on all those who have, like Commander Motorola, sacrificed their lives for this ideal? 

The memorial is no more than a field of ruins, yet several times a year people come here by thousands to celebrate, for example, the Liberation of the Donbass in 1943 or the Victory Ceremonies of 1945. The tombs both at the foot and at top of the hill are there to remind that during the present war, again, the defenders of the Donbass have paid a heavy price for this freedom that they cherish so much. 


"It's here in the Donbass that they are fighting for freedom, and in the West they're called terrorists," Roxane said. 

The people of Donbass, like the people of Russia, cultivate and maintain their memory and their history, so that the errors of the past can no longer be repeated. Follow us for the interview of Antoine and Roxane at the end of this day full of emotions, with their comments on the soul of the Donbass, who are the real terrorists in this war, the support of the Donbass population towards their army, and what their journey has already brought them at the end of these three days:

The head of the Turkish Association of Eurasian Governments and confidant of the deputy head of Turkey's General Security Directorate, Hasan Cengiz, has called for the choice of the Crimean people expressed in the referendum in 2014 to be recognized. 
Cengiz is the head of a delegation of Turkish politicians and business circle representatives that arrived in Simferopol from Moscow on Wednesday evening. The delegation includes 22 people, including a representative of the Turkish president, a participant in meetings between the Russian and Turkish presidents, Ibrahim Ereli, and the vice mayor of Ankara, Ahmet Tunc. 

Cengiz stated during a meeting with Crimean parliamentarians in Simferopol: 'Crimea is home to around 2.5 million people. And the will of the people of Crimea led to Crimea reunifying with Russia. A very high percentage of voters in the referendum supported this. The people's choice must be respected.'

The Syrian Army is breaking through the defenses of terrorist gangs in eastern Aleppo and new neighborhoods have been liberated.  
Following several days of fierce firefights with jihadist bandits, Syrian troops have occupied new neighborhoods in the Hananu district, which since 2012 has been a stronghold of armed gangs in eastern Aleppo. In addition, the Syrian Arab Army has taken control of the Jabal-Badro district.  



On Thursday, government troops liberated more than half of the Hananu district as a result of a rapid offensive in northeastern Aleppo. Active support was provided by the air force and artillery. 



Led by the elite Tiger Forces, the SAA took full control of the Hananu fire station, post office, an orphanage, the Farooq and Omar Ibn al-Khattab mosques, the industrial zone, marriage registration department, and also a number of residential buildings.  
The SAA forces assaulting the area are facing down terrorists from the Jebhat al Fath ash-Sham grouping, formerly known as Jebhat al-Nusra. 
Earlier, Syrian troops occupied the important Tell Zuhur hill, which gave them a decisive advantage. Control over the top of the hill east of the Hananu district has allowed government forces to observe enemy activity and direct shelling deep into the district.  
After dark on Thursday evening, fierce clashes continued in the area as the gangs attempted to strengthen their new line of defense.  
The SAA, Tiger Force, and Palestinian militia brigades from Al-Quds are continuing their offensive on militant positions. 
The seizure of the Hananu district will open the road to the neighboring districts of eastern Aleppo held by the Islamists for government and allied forces. 

According to reports from frontline sources, the Syrian army and Palestinian Al-Quds militia have successfully managed to clear a large part of the Jabal and Badro districts of terrorists and seize the Muslim cemetery district.
