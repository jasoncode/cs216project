By Peter Koenig on October 26, 2016 The penultimate goal is total militarization of the western world, to prevent and suppress protests and revolts . 
by Peter Koenig 
False flagging has hundreds of years of history; successful history that is, otherwise the method of lying and bullying people into false beliefs, that would not have survived the times. 
But false flags took on a new dimension since 9/11. The subsequent terror acts, including the Arab Spring and 'Color Revolutions'; downing of a Russian plane over Egypt; shooting down of a Malaysian plane over the Ukraine; Paris murderous shootings at 'Charlie Hebdo' and 'Bataclan'; Brussels; Nice; Munich; Orlando, Florida; San Bernardino, California – to name just a few over the last years – were perpetrated by the very actors claiming to fight terror, namely predominantly the secret services of the US, UK and Israel, the European vassals and NATO. The purpose of such acts of terror is to create fear, to justify a police crackdown on the populations and each time doing away with more of the democratic civil rights still left in western society. 
The penultimate goal is total militarization of the western world, to prevent and suppress protests and revolts if and when the population eventually wakes up to the flagrant lies that it has been force-fed by the presstitute media for years on end. 
And that in itself is a crucial step towards the ultimate goal of Full Spectrum Dominance of the world, or world hegemony, by a small corporate and financial elite. Alas, militarization of the west and ongoing wars and chaos throughout the world, causing millions of death – estimated between 12 and 15 million in the last 15 years – will not suffice to dominate the eastern powers led by Russia and China. Do the elites who pull the strings in Washington want a nuclear war? It may fulfill their pathological objective of total annihilation of the world as we know it, possibly with hundreds of millions of casualties. Just look at Aleppo and multiply this image by a million. See also Kissinger's 1974 Plan for Food Control Genocide. https://www.schillerinstitute.org/food_for_peace/kiss_nssm_jb_1995.html . Emails expose close ties between Hillary Clinton and former Secretary of State and accused war criminal Henry Kissinger. Is reduction of world population by any means a major objective: Kissinger's 1974 'study' on famine as genocide, was commissioned in full connivance with Monsanto and the GMO technology – a food war, the preparation of which is ongoing as the world is facing a nuclear threat. 
Intensified through four decades of Cold War, the US has grown increasingly dependent on the military – security industry for its economic advances. Creating weapons to exploit and destroy in foreign lands what later needs reconstruction is an easy way to making huge profits, sustaining an otherwise outsourced production economy and an ever poorer local population that lives off imported junk. 
This is true for the misinformed US and European public. The West is sinking by its own inaction into a deep hole. 
However, the need for more sophisticated weaponry and more destruction is spiraling exponentially, as greed, avarice and power know no limits. A WWIII scenario is becoming an imminent danger.   wars 
Do the neocon architects of US foreign policy hope to survive a nuclear inferno in their lush bunkers? The western presstitute media portrays the US as fighting in the Middle East and elsewhere 'humanitarian wars' to stamp out terrorism and other atrocities committed by the new Killary anointed Axis of Evil, Russia-Iran-Syria, and by association, China. The basic premise is, they are the 'good guys” and the Russians under Putin's orders are constantly interfering with America's humanitarian deeds. This sick understanding, continuously touted by the western media controlled by the six Zionist-Anglo media giants, and repeated hourly, will make massive, credible false-flagging like a walk in the park – a walk in which about a billion 'westerners' are cheering for war against the eastern evil. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Russia 
Currently the US is secretly on DEFCON level 3 warning against a Russian nuclear attack (DEFCON = Defense Readiness Condition) . The American public doesn't know it. – Level 3 means an attack could be days away; level one would imply an imminent attack within less than an hour. 
This in itself is a false flag, a make-believe that a first strike may come from Russia, when the Pentagon hawks openly boast that a first preventive strike is not off the table. Some high level generals even push for it. 
There is a massive orchestrated build-up of potential false flags around the globe that would allow a first strike nuclear attack on several fronts against Russia, Syria, Iran and China, by the US armed forces, NATO and the European vassals' own armies. Israel is poised to launch an attack against Iran. 
Syria – the 20-nation Peace Talks of Saturday 15 October 2016 in Lausanne, Switzerland, focusing on an Aleppo cease fire, predictably failed to produce any tangible results. Nevertheless, in a real humanitarian effort, Russia has declared an 8-hour truce to begin on Thursday, 20 October, 'We have taken a decision not to waste time and to introduce 'humanitarian pauses', mainly for the free passage of civilians, evacuation of the sick and wounded and withdrawal of fighters. Lieutenant General Sergei Rudskoi, chief of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces 
The ceasefire would run from 0800 to 1600 local time (0500 GMT to 1300 GMT) 'in the area of Aleppo. During this period the Russian air force and Syrian government troops will halt air strikes and firing from any other types of weapons,” as 'vanguardngr.com' quoted senior Russian military officer Sergei Rudskoi as saying at a press briefing. – Later the truce has been extended to 11 hours and at yesterday's (19 October) 'peace discussion' in Berlin, hosted by Madame Merkel, Mr. Putin said he would be prepared to extend it to 3 days, if all the parties were committed to observe it. 
What if – in defiance of this mini-ceasefire – US, US-proxies, or NATO fighters keep bombing Syrian army ground troops in the Aleppo region, as well as hospitals and civilian populations, to encourage Al-Nusra, cum IS terrorists to stay their course and keep sowing misery and killing civilians? – Russia has warned Washington that any attack on Assad's troops would be the object of retaliation. Might such a scenario be a provocation to start a hot WWIII? – Precedents of defying cease fire agreements and blaming Russia for it exist in the not so distant past: 17 September, when the US air force 'by mistake' attacked Assad's ground forces killing 62 soldiers – and who knows how many civilians – then, through the complicit MSM blamed Russia for it. US attack on Syrian troops not an accident, definitely intentional – Assad to AP 
It is not inconceivable that US war planes painted to look like Russians, could attack their own Air Force in Syria or Iraq, blaming Russia, thereby triggering a US first strike. 
With the brainwashed western population, the false flag would be an easy sell as a Russian aggression, justifying Washington's 'first strike'. 
America's indefectible British ally has recently given its fighter jet pilots 'permission' to fire on Russian aircraft in Syria. – What if they actually do so, as a US proxy? – And Russia retaliates against a NATO country – which is according to NATO rules an aggression against all NATO. This could mean an all-out war. US and NATO bases in Europe would not be spared. By now there are 24 bases, an increase from 14 since 1991, when the West promised not to expand NATO. This would plunge Europe for the third time in 100 years into – this time an all-annihilating – war scenario. How can Europe not see and understand this? 
Yemen – Since March 2015 a Saudi led coalition, for which until recently Washington provided weapons, logistical and intelligence support, is bombing the Houthi rebels. The Houtis, fighting for freedom from the western domination, have seized the Presidential Palace in Sana'a, sending the despotic US puppet President Hadi to Saudi Arabia into exile. The Houthis enjoy the backing of the majority of the Yemeni population and are considered the legitimate government. They also receive logistics support from Iran. They control about a quarter of the Yemeni landmass but more than three quarters of the population. The Saudis have been cowardly targeting mostly civilian populations, family celebrations, like weddings and funerals, humanitarian food and medical supplies and hospitals, slaughtering tens of thousands of mainly women and children. A couple of weeks ago the US and UK Air Forces have joined the Saudis in this atrocious war. The Geo-Political Nature of the Strait of Hormuz 
While the Houthis have called on President Putin for help, the US has now called, through the UN, for a 72-hour ceasefire to enter into effect on 19 October mid-night. The official purpose is 'humanitarian aid', but the real reason is for the alliance of aggressors to regroup and strategize. It is inconceivable that the Master of Chaos would let go of such an optimal strategically placed country, overlooking the Gulf of Oman and the Iran controlled Strait of Hormuz, through which currently about 25 % of the world's hydrocarbons sail. A western planted false flag, depicting a Russian intervention, could easily activate a full-scale war. 
Israel, entering friendly relations with the Saudis, has asked the House of Saud for access to Saudi airfields which they may use to launch a 'preemptive' attack against Iran. 
Internet spying and cyber war accusations against President Putin – most ridiculous, but with sledgehammer propaganda the American and most of European population will gulp this lie as the truth – and encourage US, UK and Israeli secret services (the infamous trio) to do likewise. 
The argument is that Mr. Putin wants to derail US elections in favor of Donald Trump and hacking into DNC computers to divulge Democratic party corruption scandals – laying bare Madame Clinton's corruption and lies. Apparently the CIA has already declared a cyber war against President Putin. 
Russia could potentially retaliate, jamming key US strategic war systems with DRFM (Digital Radio Frequency Memory) technology, already successfully applied in 2015 in Syria, near Latakia, disrupting all US-NATO Radar and Satellites Communication systems. – Might such a possible retaliation and escalation in cyber warfare be translated into a lethal aggression by Russia, justifying a full-out war, with nuclear consequences? 
On 19 October, Presidents Putin, Hollande and Poroshenko traveled to Berlin at the invitation of Madame Merkel to discuss Syria and implementation of a peace plan for eastern Ukraine. First, how come, a sovereign country like Syria is discussed by foreign powers, without – and I mean without any representation of Mr. Assad's government? It is a human and diplomatic aberration. But what else would we expect from the west. Still, people need to be reminded that what appears normal is NOT normal at all. 
The little that emerged from the meeting is that Mr. Hollande went home frustrated since Mr. Putin did not stand up to 'his responsibilities in Ukraine'- what a flagrant lie! And Hollande knows it! – A lso was disclosed that no real agreement was reached on how to go about achieving peace in Syria. Putin answering questions regarding ISIS from a US journalist 
Obviously for the western stooges of Washington, present in Berlin, there is only one way a 'solution' could be found: 'Regime Change'. They will not let go. Even though Hollande and Merkel know absolutely well, why the US instigated the war in Syria, by recruiting and preparing, arming and funding terror groups already in 2007 (look for 'Syria' in this article 
http://www.globalresearch.ca/its-not-just-the-oil-the-middle-east-war-and-the-conquest-of-natural-gas-reserves/5307589 
On Ukraine – Poroshenko has promised a new road map for peace, nothing more exciting. The practical deadlock on Syria and 'no news' on Ukraine was to be expected. It is of course being blamed by both Hollande and Merkel on Vladimir Putin, who has never played a role in either conflict, both of them are the result of the evil fist of Washington. 
Mr. Putin entered Syria only at the demand of Mr. Assad, to defend and rid the country of western implanted terrorists. He is also doing everything possible to pacify Ukraine, to no avail. 
The west doesn't want peace, but they want to blame Russia for the conflicts. Failure of the Merkel meeting might possibly be followed by a false flag against Kiev or Aleppo, to be put on Putin's account, what else. Remember, the US Air Force has jets painted as Russian jets. 
China 
Would a US provocation on the Chinese controlled Spratly Islands, or an infringement on China's air and land space, as there have been many in the past, become a trigger for engaging China in a nuclear aggression? South China sea 
Hot spots around the world devastated to chaos by the empire abound. Anyone of them is a potential launch path for an atomic mushroom. Should this happen before the upcoming US elections, Obama might just stay on for another term. He has all the experience it needs to create more chaos and more division to conquer than any of his predecessors. He is also an obedient servant to those that pull the strings and watch through the eye on top of the pyramid, so clearly depicted in the US dollar bill, the symbol for Zionist-Freemason total hegemony. But importantly, he, like Hillary, would most likely not hesitate to push the Red Bottom, when asked to do so by their masters.

By Cristiano Lima 
Hillary Clinton slammed the California National Guard and Pentagon on Monday for reportedly demanding soldiers who fought in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan a decade ago to return enlistment bonuses they received for their service. 
'I am appalled that National Guard officials are attempting to recoup money from soldiers who accepted bonuses a decade ago,” the Democratic nominee said in a statement released Monday night in response to the reports, which first appeared in the Los Angeles Times. 
'These troops deserve our support and our deepest gratitude; they served admirably and upheld their part of the bargain,” she said. 'It is unacceptable to now subject them and their families to undue financial burdens thanks to to mismanagement from the California National Guard and rigid bureaucracy on the part of the Pentagon.”

‹ › Arnaldo Rodgers is a trained and educated Psychologist. He has worked as a community organizer and activist. Controversial Proposal for Nurses Could Expand Access to Care for Veterans By Arnaldo Rodgers on October 26, 2016 Veterans By Melissa Quinn 
For years, state and federal policymakers have discussed proposals to expand the role of advanced practice registered nurses, with major physician groups like the American Medical Association squaring off against nurse organizations like the American Nurses Association. 
But a proposed rule from the Department of Veterans Affairs to allow nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, and clinical nurse specialists to practice independently of physicians has brought the debate to the national spotlight and sparked an unprecedented response from the public. 
'To use advanced practice registered nurses to their full authority, it improves access and enables the delivery of high-quality care, and that's good for everybody,” Marla Weston, CEO of the American Nurses Association, told The Daily Signal. 'It's good for the health care system, and it's good for people in all sorts of ways.”

By Fred Lucas 
Veterans must be given preference in securing federal jobs, according to long-standing laws, but hiring hasn't always worked out in their favor. A federal audit found that on numerous occasions, agencies placed Obama administration political appointees into career government jobs with civil service protections—bypassing veterans. 
Much of the federal bureaucracy has turned against men and women who served the country in the military, said Darin Selnick, a retired Air Force captain and former official at the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
'There is a clear bias against veterans. They think veterans should start at the bottom like everyone else,” Selnick told The Daily Signal in a phone interview.

Military Veterans Are Helping To Save Coral Reefs By Combating Climate Change By Arnaldo Rodgers on October 27, 2016 Veterans Are Helping To Save Coral Reefs Find Your Job Now at HireVeterans.com 
By Ken Silverstein At a time when the presidential election is dividing families and friends, at least one issue is bridging the gap: giving veterans of the U.S. military a new lease on life by teaching them how to restore coral reefs. And they are trying to enlist big business as their ally. Indeed, the marriage of the ocean's ecology along with those who have served their nation is breathing a new spirit into the coral reefs, which make up a whole community of living organisms that survive on the ocean floor. Those reefs aren't just a thing of beauty. They are also an economic engine, spawning entire enterprises that range from tourism to medicine, including the making of drugs that deal with cancer, arthritis and bacterial infections. 'Our guys are special forces who are physically strong but who are also struggling,” says Jim Ritterhoff, founder of Force Blue that combines the virtues of military training with coral reef restoration.

  Woodward On Clinton Foundation 'It's Corrupt” By VNN on October 28, 2016 He's correct: The Clinton Foundation is corrupt, and voters should be troubled by Clinton's role in the unethical pay-for-play scandals. 
Conservative Tribune 
Voters have been concerned about Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's involvement in the scandal-ridden Clinton Foundation. 
Liberal journalist Bob Woodward legitimized those concerns Sunday on Fox News by pointing to the Foundation's ' pay-for-play ” scandals while Clinton served as secretary of state as something that should trouble voters. 
Woodward, who broke the Watergate story that led to the downfall of President Richard Nixon, told host Chris Wallace in no uncertain terms that the Clinton Foundation is 'corrupt” and a 'scandal.” 
Watch Woodward's comments on Fox News Sunday here: 
'There are allegations about the Clinton Foundation and pay-for-play,” Wallace said. 'When you see what seems to be clear evidence that Clinton Foundation donors were being treated differently than non-donors in terms of access, when you see this new revelations (sic) about the $12 million deal between Hillary Clinton, the Foundation and the King of Morocco, are voters right to be troubled by this?” 
'Yes,” Woodward responded. ' It's corrupt . It's a scandal.” 
Wallace had attempted to get answers from Clinton about the issue at the final presidential debate with Republican candidate Donald Trump. 
But of course Clinton ducked the moderator's question and instead talked about the organization's charitable donations rather than its extreme conflicts of interest — something Woodward took note of and criticized her for. 
'She didn't answer your question at all,” Woodward told Wallace. 'And she turned to embrace the good work that the Clinton Foundation has done.” 
Woodward apparently didn't want to discredit the 'good work” done by the organization, but pointed out that even its 'good work” is compromised by the overwhelming evidence of corruption. 
'(T)he mixing of speech fees, the Clinton Foundation and actions by the State Department — which she ran — are all intertwined and it's corrupt,” he argued. 
He's correct: The Clinton Foundation is corrupt, and voters should be troubled by Clinton's role in the unethical pay-for-play scandals. 
Unfortunately Clinton has an acute ability to avoid being held accountable for her scandals, but we have faith in the American people and their desire to be led by a person with integrity and respect for the office he holds, not someone who continuously looks for ways for his political power to benefit his personal life.

BY CHARLES E. SCHMIDT Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter's announcement on Wednesday that the Pentagon is suspending its program to claw back military signing bonuses is a welcome development amid a debacle that should never have happened. The hounding of nearly 10,000 California National Guard veterans to repay money that was mistakenly given for re-enlisting at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars was not just ungrateful. It was poor strategy. Imagine being a recent high school or college graduate considering career options. Your recruiter promises you a generous bonus in exchange for a few years of being told where to live, where to work and what time to wake up — while, by the way, possibly getting shot or blown up and killed. You would also be required to subject yourself to a justice system that could send you to prison for a disagreement with your boss.

Veteran forced to pay back bonus: 'I was left nearly penniless' By Arnaldo Rodgers on October 28, 2016 Veteran By Kait Richmond and Marisa Russell Robert Richmond dedicated 15 years to serving his country. Part of that time was rewarded with a $15,000 bonus, promised to him if he agreed to re-enlist and complete another six years of service. In November 2006 Richmond received the money. He honorably retired from the military in 2012, and two years later — nearly a decade after he got the bonus — he received a letter demanding he repay it. 'I was left nearly penniless,” the father of two told CNN's Chris Cuomo on 'New Day” on Wednesday. 
Thousands forced to repay Richmond is not alone — thousands of other veterans were forced to repay millions of dollars in re-enlistment bonuses after the California National Guard awarded them in error. When officials realized their mistake, they wanted their money back — with interest.

Abby Martin Exposes What Hillary Clinton Really Represents ‹ › Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. 65 US 'journalists' at a private dinner with Hillary Clinton's team and John Podesta By VNN on October 26, 2016 We wanted to make sure everyone on this email had the latest information on the two upcoming dinners with reporters. Both are off-the-record. 
Hang The Bankers 
Several top journalists and TV news anchors RSVPed 'yes” to attend a private, off-the-record gathering at the New York home of Joel Benenson, the chief campaign strategist for Hillary Clinton, two days before she announced her candidacy in 2015, according to emails Wikileaks has published from John Podesta 's purported accounts. 
The guest list for an earlier event at the home of John Podesta was limited to reporters who were expected to cover Clinton on the campaign trail. 
The email thread starts with Jesse Ferguson, the campaign's Deputy National Press Secretary and Senior Spokesman, describing the venues and target audience of each gathering: 
We wanted to make sure everyone on this email had the latest information on the two upcoming dinners with reporters. Both are off-the-record. 
1) Thursday night, April 9th at 7:00p.m. Dinner at the Home of John Podesta… This will be with about 20 reporters who will closely cover the campaign (aka the bus). 
2) Friday night, April 10th at 6:30p.m. Cocktails and Hors D'oeuvre at the Home of Joel Benenson… This is with a broader universe of New York reporters. 
The 'broader universe of New York reporters” includes several top news anchors for network and cable channels, many of whom are listed as a 'yes” for the appearance: 
From ABC: Cecilia Vega, David Muir, Diane Sawyer (who could only stay for 30 minutes), and George Stephanopoulos. 
From CBS News: Norah O'Donnell. 
From CNN: Brianna Keilar, Gloria Borger, John Berman, and Kate Bolduan. 
From MSNBC: Alex Wagner and Rachel Maddow ('TRYING”). 
From NBC: Savannah Guthrie. 
'Yes” respondent George Stephanopoulos worked for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign and was a Senior Adviser to the President during Clinton's first White House term. Stephanopoulos does not disclose this fact when reporting on the 2016 Clinton campaign for ABC News. 
The nascent Clinton campaign invited Jeff Zucker and Phil Griffin, the presidents of CNN and MSNBC, respectively. Zucker declined while Griffin RSVPed 'yes.” CNBC's John Harwood 
Wikileaks' release of emails from the Democratic National Committee showed then-DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz scheduled or attempted to schedule private meetings with both executives.Other 'yes” RSVPs come from journalists who have been sighted in the Wikileaks Podesta emails, outing them as friendly or fawning towards Hillary's campaign. 
CNBC's John Harwood, who was also a moderator for a 2015 presidential debate, emailed Podesta frequently , practically begging for approval and access . Politico's Glenn Thrush 
Politico's Glenn Thrush also emailed Podesta periodically. On Monday, a newly-released email revealed a particularly humiliating incident where Thrush sent Podesta a passage from an upcoming article for his personal approval. 
'Because I have become a hack I will send u the whole section that pertains to u,” Thrush wrote. 'Please don't share or tell anyone I did this… Tell me if I fucked up anything.” 
Sandra Sobieraj Westfall, Washington Bureau Chief at PEOPLE magazine, boasted two days after this confab that stories on Clinton's campaign were generating 'absolutely off the charts” traffic and asked for 'color you can whisper on background” about what Hillary was up to. Joel Benenson – Clinton Chief Strategist 
The full RSVP list for Benenson's gathering is shown in an attachment on a separate email : 
This is an off-the-record cocktails with the key national reporters, especially (though not exclusively) those that are based in New York. Much of the group includes influential reporters, anchors and editors. 
The goals of the dinner include: (1) Give reporters their first thoughts from team HRC in advance of the announcement (2) Setting expectations for the announcement and launch period (3) Framing the HRC message and framing the race (4) Enjoy a Friday night drink before working more 
TIME/DATE: As a reminder, this is called for 6:30 p.m. on Friday, April 10th . 
There are several attendees – including Diane Sawyer – who will be there promptly at 6:30 p.m. but have to leave by 7 p.m. 
… 
FOOD: This will include cocktails and passed hours devours.

Clinton Campaign Memo: 'Let's Troll Reddit” By VNN on October 25, 2016 If Donald Trump Wins The Election, It Will Be The Biggest Miracle In U.S. Political History 
InvestmentWatch 
A confidential memo from a Democratic Super PAC details a Clinton campaign strategy of trolling sites such as Reddit in order to cause 'digital disruption”. 
According to a Correct The Record memo, Clinton campaigners are being urged to disrupt and dominate the World Wide Web in order to stifle growing pro-Trump sentiment prevalent on sites such as Reddit . 
The memo reads: 
We are entering the final phase of the election and this is an all-hands-on-deck full-spectrum push for digital disruption and dominance. We are facing a decentralized leaderless emergent structure that can only be countered by our numbers with discipline and tactics. As such, these will be the scripts for Week 0 (through Week 3 to the vote) 
REDDIT 
Smart, but paranoid 
Reddit is an important clearinghouse for Trump-momentum and intellectual capital. We must maintain dominance on promotion/demotion of stories and isolation of Trump-positive threads. 
We are working to compromise moderators to improve our ability but will 'operationalize” them in the final week of the campaign to try to make the board 'go dark.” 
Reddit is more intellectually rigorous than the chans and has fewer low-social-capital (loser) members (including many far-right non-American posters). We should be careful not to trigger moderator red-lines. Proscribed disruption vectors.

Her writing has been featured in several print and online publications in the Middle East. She is committed to exposing (AIPAC) the Israel Lobby's control of American policy for the Middle East. Control which amounts to treason by the Zionist Lobbies in America and its stooges in Congress, and that guarantees there can never be a peaceful resolution of the Middle East conflicts, only catastrophe for all, in the region and the world. Her focus is Israel's drift towards greater oppression of the Palestinian people; the political deceptions and crisis in Syria and Ukraine; the cold hard facts about America's so-called 'war on terror' and grim future; countering the propaganda war towards Iran & Russia and calling attention to, the new, developing, promising, strategic alliances as a consequence. Her mission is to inform and educate the public on issues of the US/Middle East conflicts that are unreported, underreported, or distorted in the Zionist owned American Media. Her writing reflects the incredible resilience, almost superhuman steadfastness of the occupied and oppressed Palestinians, who are now facing the prospect of a final round of ethnic cleansing. Her mission is to inform and educate internet viewers seeking unfiltered information about real events on issues of the US/Middle East conflicts that are unreported, underreported, or distorted in the American media.

Donald Trump delivers POWERFUL policy speech on First 100 Days In Office By Debbie Menon on October 24, 2016 GROUNDBREAKING CONTRACT FOR THE AMERICAN VOTER 
Trump Presents 100-Day Plan To Make America Great Again – For Everyone 
Gettysburg, PA: Today, in historic Gettysburg, PA, Donald J. Trump presented a game-changing plan for his first 100 days in office. This revolutionary 'Contract with the American Voter” will ensure that America's economy is revitalized and citizens are protected. 
'I'm not a politician, and have never wanted to be one. But when I saw the trouble our country was in, I knew I couldn't stand by and watch any longer. Our country has been so good to me, I love our country, I felt I had to act,” said Mr. Trump in his address. 
'Change has to come from outside this broken system. The fact that the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once in a lifetime,” he continued. 
'I am asking the American people to rise above the noise and the clutter of our broken politics, and to embrace that great faith and optimism that has always been the central ingredient in the American character. I am asking you to dream big. 
'What follows is my 100-day action plan to Make America Great Again. It is a contract between Donald J. Trump and the American voter – and begins with restoring honesty, accountability and change to Washington,” he concluded. 
DONALD J. TRUMP CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN VOTER 
'Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC: 
FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress; SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health); THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated; FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service; FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government; SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. 
On the same day, I will begin taking the following seven actions to protect American workers: 
FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars' worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America's water and environmental infrastructure 
Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law: 
FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won't take them back FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. 
Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration: 
1. Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. 
2. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. 
3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral. 
4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable. 
5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. 
6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. 
7. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. 
8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars. 
9. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values 
10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics. 
On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. 
This is my pledge to you. 
And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people.” Related Posts:

I just heard an NPR presstitute declare that Texas, a traditional sure thing for Republicans was up for grabs in the presidential election. Little wonder if this report on Zero Hedge is correct. Apparently, the voting machines are already at work stealing the election for Killary. 
http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-25/texas-rigged-first-reports-voting-machines-switching-votes-hillary-texas 
From my long experience in journalism, I know the American public is not very sharp. Nevertheless, it is difficult for me to believe that Americans, whose jobs, careers, and the same for their children and grandchildren, have been sold out by the elites who Hillary represents would actually vote for her. It makes no sense. If this were the case, how did Trump get the Republican nomination despite the vicious presstitute campaign against him? 
It seems obvious that the majority of Americans who have been suffering terribly at the hands of the One Percent who own Hillary lock, stock, and barrel, will not vote for the people who have ruined their lives and the lives of their children and grandchildren. 
Furthermore, if Trump's election is as impossible as the presstitutes tell us—Hillary's win is 93% certain according to the latest presstitute pronouncement—the vicious 24/7 attacks on Trump would be pointless. Wouldn't they? Why the constant, frenetic, vicious attacks on a person who has no chance? Trump takes aim at those rigging the system 
There are reports that a company associated with Hillary backer George Soros is supplying the voting machines to 16 states , including states that determine election outcomes. I do not know that these reports are correct. However, I do know for a fact that the oligarchic interests that rule America are opposed to Trump being elected President for the simple reason that they are unsure that they would be able to control him. 
It is hard to believe that dispossessed Americans will vote for Hillary, the representative of those who have dispossessed them, when Trump says he will re-empower the dispossessed. Hillary has denigrated ordinary Americans who, she says, she is so removed from by her wealth that she doesn't even know who they are. Clearly, Hillary, paid $675,000 by Goldman Sachs for three 20-minute speeches, is not a representative of the people. She represents the One Percent whose policies have flushed the prospects of ordinary Americans down the toilet. 
What is really disturbing is the pretense by the presstitute scum that Trump's lewd admiration for female charms is deemed more important than the prospect of nuclear war. At no time during the presidential primaries or during the current presidential campaign has it been mentioned that Russia is being assaulted daily by propaganda, threatened by military buildups, and being convinced that the United States and its European vassals are planning an attack. Architects of 'Regime Change” Wars 
A threatened Russia, made insecure by inexplicable hostility and Western propaganda, is a danger manufactured by the neoconservative supporters of Hillary Clinton. 
If the American people are really so unbelievably stupid that they think lewd remarks about women are more important than avoiding nuclear war, the American people are too stupid to exist. They will deserve the mushroom clouds that will wipe them and everyone else off the face of the earth. 
Donald Trump is the only candidate in the primaries and the general election who has said that he sees no point in conflict with Russia when Putin has shown nothing but desire to work things out to mutual advantage. 
In contrast, Hillary has declared the thrice-elected president of Russia to be 'the new Hitler” and has threatened Russia with military action. Hillary talks openly about regime change in Russia. 
Surely, in a free media at least one person in the print and TV media would raise this most important of all points. But where have you seen it? 

Only in my columns and a few others in the alternative media. 
In other words, we are about to have an election in which the important issue has played no role. And yet allegedly we are the exceptional, indispensable people, a people's democracy protected by a free press. 
In truth, this mythical description of America is merely a cloak for the rule of the Oligarchs. And the Oligarchs are risking life on earth for their continual supremacy.

  Without intention, Mike kind fulfills the proverb that not all who wander are lost. A 1973 graduate of the College of the Holy Cross with a BA in Philosophy, he had successfully dodged the draft during Vietnam, despite his lottery number of 29. Logically, after failing at being a bum for a year after college, he then enlisted in the Army. His theory was to hang out for two years, go to Germany, date blondes, drink lots of beer, improve his wretched German and come home to use the GI Bill for Graduate School. Didn't quite work out that way; he did go to Germany and stayed five years first tour; married a red-headed American GI who worked in S2; did drink lots of beer and developed some acuity with pidgin Deutsch. Mike re-enlisted and then wandered through a great 23 years as a soldier. A lot of it sucked, of course; but, he avoided ending his adolescence until the end of the 23 years…since then, he's been in a fight to regain that feeling of camaraderie, purpose and trust. Mike chose to stay a career NCO. There were a couple of dozen reasons, but they're best summed up by the fact that he really didn't like officers. He still doesn't, sheepishly at times admitting that 'Some of my best friends are officers. Some of my best friends are gay. Some of my best friends are gay officers. I'm not gay and I'm not an officer – I like it better that way.” He got his initial First Sergeant assignment in his 14th year and basically stayed a First Sergeant until he retired, as a First Sergeant. If he hadn't retired, the day after the retirement would have been the day he pinned on CSM stripes but, as he says, 'Some of my best friends are Sergeant Majors; some of my best friends are hookers. I'm not a Sergeant Major and I'm not a hooker and that works fine for me.” Since retiring, Mike's worked in Labor Relations, HR and General Management for government, tribes, nonprofits and for profits including Defense Contractors. He's found that his 'not being a hooker” approach hasn't necessarily worked to his career advantage. He's picked up a bunch of irrelevant graduate degrees, that basically were there to teach you how to be a Hobbit. Hobbits are small, insignificant fearful types who scurry around getting in the way and accomplishing nothing of any great merit. He believes that the movies would have been infinitely better had the bad guys killed off all the Hobbits in the first part of the first movie, and then spent the rest of it avenging the little twits. Mike really hates Hobbits He's a Senior Professional in Human Resources and a Six Sigma Black Belt. He plays guitar, reads, broods and drives too fast in fast cars – currently, a Mustang GT – channeling Hunter S. Thompson, patrolling 'on the edge of the desert, just outside of Barstow.” An avowed leftist and philosophical Stoic, Mike admits that everything is probably going to hell, but thinks that it's the duty of people of honor to work to stop it from going there too quick. Since he regards all veterans as his extended family, he expects that they'll do the same. An oddly religious guy, Mike believes that God is a not very bright, self—entered and hormonal teenage girl obsessed with the Jonas Brothers and whether or not her Daisy Duke jeans make her ass look fat. They do, but he's not going to be the one to tell her the truth. God can't handle the truth. While he might write about anything, he's really interested in business, economics and how to keep people from being screwed by machines, be they corporate, government, or societal. He's also interested in guitars... Dispatches from Wolf Country — Kale and Seal Liver By Mike Farrell on October 29, 2016 The reason why young people don't turn out for elections is because they don't remember how badly things can go. How hard can it be to run a country is a question asked by outsiders; how bad can it be is a question asked by those who don't remember; what's the worst thing that can happen is the one asked by well-insulated di pshits who should watch some footage of the Cultural Revolution in China interspersed with Triumph of the Will and 1984. A Center Right Party for Progressives! Pirate Party Logo With Dragon Head The Pirates promise to introduce direct democracy, subject the workings of government to more scrutiny and place the country's natural resources under public ownership. The party also seeks tough rules to protect individuals from online intrusion. Jonsdottir, the Pirates' most prominent voice, is a former ally of WikiLeaks who has called on Iceland to offer citizenship to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.Opponents claim the inexperienced Pirates could scare off investors and destabilise an economy that is now recovering, with low unemployment and high growth. 'We'd rather be naive than corrupt,” Jonsdottir said. – The Guardian, Oct 29, 2016 
Bill Mahar, the commentator comedian, had a bit going during the height of the 'If Trump wins, I'm going to Canada!” thing that American progressives and liberals couldn't all go to Canada because if they did, 'Who's going to eat all this fucking Kale!?” Well, perhaps this offers a solution. If the best thing in the world happens, perhaps we can export it to Iceland… Birgitta Jonsdottir, Iceland's Pirate Party Leader — Stuff.Co.NZ 
Iceland strikes me more and more as a very cool place. Cold, but cool. Michael Lewis had a great Vanity Fair article 'Wall Street on the Tundra” about the 2008 economic crisis worldwide focusing on Iceland. Iceland had no reason to be sucked into that mess but was, like a Long Ship dragged under the ocean by a Krakken powered whirlpool. Fishermen found themselves as real estate magnates and shepards as billionaire speculators, largely in the UK, leveraging debt and selling tranches of fish futures while getting used to driving Bentley's and Astons around Reykjavik in Trump designer label suits under their seal skins. 
When it all went to hell, and it did, the country convulsed, shook it off, sent the fishermen-shepherd speculators back to sea and sheep while the poets, intellectuals and activists led largely by lesbian politicians,'various poets and saga translators; and World Strong Man champions took over and got things running again only with more transparency, efficiency and effectiveness. What the hell do you expect in a country where everybody is related to Bjork? And, of course, to Eric the Red and Leif Ericsson? In a country where the Parliament's Official Name Translate from Danish to The Thing? 
Anyway, they have an election today, and there's a good possibility that the Pirate Party, founded on-line in the post 2008 period and led by female poet named Brigitta Jonsdottir could end up in a leading role in one or another version of a governing coalition. Of course, before we get too excited, we should remember that despite an average electoral turnout of 80%, young people tend to blow off elections at a very high rate and the Pirate Party is a youth party, so… 
Selling tranches of fish futures driving Astons around Reykjavik in Trump designer suits under their seal skins. 
I suspect the reason why young people don't turn out for elections is because they don't remember how badly things can go. How hard can it be to run a country is a question asked by outsiders; how bad can it be is a question asked by those who don't remember; what's the worst thing that can happen is the one asked by well-insulated dipshits who should watch some footage of the Cultural Revolution in China interspersed with Triumph of the Will and 1984. 
It's possible that for Iceland and Europe as a whole, 2008 is close enough to encourage people to remember; and, since Iceland is limited from the Nationalist and Corporatist hysteria facing the UK and the rest of the EU, they might be able to avoid the Fascist tinge to so much…after all, I think their platform, for a center-right party is to the left of Bernie Sanders. Hope so. Related Posts:

By www.foxnews.com 
Veterans may be more likely to commit suicide during the first year after they leave the military than after more time passes, a U.S. study suggests. 
Compared with people still on active duty in the military, veterans out of the service for up to three months were 2.5 times more likely to commit suicide, the study found. Veterans who had left the service from three to 12 months earlier had almost triple the suicide odds of current members of the military. 
'Family members and community can be proactive to reach out to veterans if they recently experienced stressful events – not just limited to the stressful events we can capture in the data such as divorce or separation from the military,” said lead study author Yu-Chu Shen, a researcher at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.

‹ › Arnaldo Rodgers is a trained and educated Psychologist. He has worked as a community organizer and activist. VA fails to properly examine thousands of veterans By Arnaldo Rodgers on October 29, 2016 VA 
Thousands of veterans may have been improperly diagnosed by the VA. 
The federal department admits it was improperly testing for traumatic brain injuries from 2007 through 2015. 
Nate Anderson has served in the United States Army for 12 years. 
'There's a promise that we make to service members, that if you serve and you put your life on the line or sacrifice in whatever way you do, we'll take care of you. I didn't know what that was going to look like, it's certainly not what I saw,” Anderson said. 'This is something the VA should have been prepared for.” 
He enlisted after 9/11. 
'It was time in my generation that the desire to serve was strong,” he said. 
Fast forward to 2008, Anderson was assigned to his first unit at Fort Bragg and deployed to central Afghanistan.

I just heard an NPR presstitute declare that Texas, a traditional sure thing for Republicans was up for grabs in the presidential election. Little wonder if this report on Zero Hedge is correct. Apparently, the voting machines are already at work stealing the election for Killary. 
http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-25/texas-rigged-first-reports-voting-machines-switching-votes-hillary-texas 
From my long experience in journalism, I know the American public is not very sharp. Nevertheless, it is difficult for me to believe that Americans, whose jobs, careers, and the same for their children and grandchildren, have been sold out by the elites who Hillary represents would actually vote for her. It makes no sense. If this were the case, how did Trump get the Republican nomination despite the vicious presstitute campaign against him? 
It seems obvious that the majority of Americans who have been suffering terribly at the hands of the One Percent who own Hillary lock, stock, and barrel, will not vote for the people who have ruined their lives and the lives of their children and grandchildren. 
Furthermore, if Trump's election is as impossible as the presstitutes tell us—Hillary's win is 93% certain according to the latest presstitute pronouncement—the vicious 24/7 attacks on Trump would be pointless. Wouldn't they? Why the constant, frenetic, vicious attacks on a person who has no chance? Trump takes aim at those rigging the system 
There are reports that a company associated with Hillary backer George Soros is supplying the voting machines to 16 states , including states that determine election outcomes. I do not know that these reports are correct. However, I do know for a fact that the oligarchic interests that rule America are opposed to Trump being elected President for the simple reason that they are unsure that they would be able to control him. 
It is hard to believe that dispossessed Americans will vote for Hillary, the representative of those who have dispossessed them, when Trump says he will re-empower the dispossessed. Hillary has denigrated ordinary Americans who, she says, she is so removed from by her wealth that she doesn't even know who they are. Clearly, Hillary, paid $675,000 by Goldman Sachs for three 20-minute speeches, is not a representative of the people. She represents the One Percent whose policies have flushed the prospects of ordinary Americans down the toilet. 
What is really disturbing is the pretense by the presstitute scum that Trump's lewd admiration for female charms is deemed more important than the prospect of nuclear war. At no time during the presidential primaries or during the current presidential campaign has it been mentioned that Russia is being assaulted daily by propaganda, threatened by military buildups, and being convinced that the United States and its European vassals are planning an attack. Architects of 'Regime Change” Wars 
A threatened Russia, made insecure by inexplicable hostility and Western propaganda, is a danger manufactured by the neoconservative supporters of Hillary Clinton. 
If the American people are really so unbelievably stupid that they think lewd remarks about women are more important than avoiding nuclear war, the American people are too stupid to exist. They will deserve the mushroom clouds that will wipe them and everyone else off the face of the earth. 
Donald Trump is the only candidate in the primaries and the general election who has said that he sees no point in conflict with Russia when Putin has shown nothing but desire to work things out to mutual advantage. 
In contrast, Hillary has declared the thrice-elected president of Russia to be 'the new Hitler” and has threatened Russia with military action. Hillary talks openly about regime change in Russia. 
Surely, in a free media at least one person in the print and TV media would raise this most important of all points. But where have you seen it? 

Only in my columns and a few others in the alternative media. 
In other words, we are about to have an election in which the important issue has played no role. And yet allegedly we are the exceptional, indispensable people, a people's democracy protected by a free press. 
In truth, this mythical description of America is merely a cloak for the rule of the Oligarchs. And the Oligarchs are risking life on earth for their continual supremacy.

  The Clinton Crime Family. 'Hillary is the Most Dangerous Presidential Aspirant in US History” By VNN on October 30, 2016 Hillary is the most recklessly dangerous presidential aspirant in US history, 
by Stephen Lendman 
The Bill and Hillary crime family long ago should have been held accountable for high crimes against peace and numerous others. Hillary is the most recklessly dangerous presidential aspirant in US history, supporting endless imperial wars and state terror, once saying '(w)hat do we have NATO for if not to defend our way of life.” There was never a war Hillary did not support – Crimes against Humanity She endorses first-strike nuclear weapons use, calling them peacekeeping deterrents, mindless of their power to destroy life on earth. She's militantly anti-Russia, earlier compared the nation to Nazi Germany, Putin to Hitler, claiming 'he doesn't have a soul,” has revanchist aims, wanting Russian greatness restored – all of the above a perversion of truth, not to mention a pretext to wage war on Russia. The so-called Clinton Foundation is a suspected criminal enterprise, masquerading as a charitable NGO. It promotes Big Lies about 'improving global health, increasing opportunity for women and girls, reducing childhood obesity and preventable diseases, (as well as) creating economic opportunity and growth…” Film producer Frank Huguenard believes Hillary Clinton faces impending federal racketeering charges under the 1970 Racketeering Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Enacted to fight organized and white collar crime, racketeering is defined to include fraud, bribery, money laundering, embezzlement, drugs trafficking, murder, and various other offenses under the Federal criminal code (Title 18), even acts of terrorism. According to Huguenard, Obama-appointed FBI chief James Comey will recommend Attorney General Loretta Lynch treat 'the Clinton Foundation (as) an ongoing criminal enterprise engaged in money laundering and soliciting bribes in exchange for political, policy and legislative favors to individuals, corporations and even governments both foreign and domestic.” Morning Joe Destroys Corrupt Clinton Foundation – 'Total Corruption” Strong stuff if only partly true! Huguenard cites credible evidence, indicating the Clinton Foundation is largely a money laundering, influence peddling racket. Less than 10% of 'tens of millions of dollars donated” went for charitable purposes, the rest for self-enrichment. 'There is ample evidence already in the public record that the Clinton Foundation qualifies as a criminal enterprise and there's no doubt that the FBI is privy to significantly more evidence than has already been made public,” said Huguenard. If Comey recommends Attorney General Lynch indict Hillary Clinton, it's unlikely she'll prosecute a woman she's had close ties to for years. Bill Clinton appointed her US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York – serving from 1999 – 2001. From 2003 – 2005, she was a Wall Street controlled New York Federal Reserve Bank of New York board member – the mother bank most complicit with its member bank crooks. From 2002 – 2010, she was a Washington-headquartered Hogan & Hartson (H & H) law firm partner. Its New York-based partner Howard Topaz filed income tax returns for Bill and Hillary Clinton, beginning in 2004. In May 2004, H & H filed patent trademark documents for Denver-based MX Logic Inc., the computer software firm responsible for developing email encryption technology used to manage Hillary's private email server, beginning in July 2013. Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton According to Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, if H & H (now Hogan Lovells following a 2010 merger) 'represented the Clintons on tax matters,” Lynch is responsible for disclosing any involvement she may have had, direct or indirect. In April 2008 during Hillary's first presidential campaign, The American Lawyer called H & H one of her largest legal industry supporters. Loretta Elizabeth Lynch, Attorney General of the United States. Partner Christine Varney was chief counsel to the Clinton/Gore 1992 campaign. The ties between H & H, Lynch and the Clintons are longstanding. In November 2014, Obama announced her appointment as attorney general, succeeding Eric Holder, effective April 27, 2015 after Senate confirmation. It's hard imagining her biting a hand contributing greatly to her career advancement. Key for Clinton is how much more of her dark side becomes public knowledge besides what's already known. If enough despite Lynch declining to indict and supportive media scoundrels downplaying or whitewashing her offenses, the Democratic (sic) National Committee (DNC) might be forced to jettison her as damaged goods. She'd be red meat for Trump to take full advantage of in the fall campaign. Would Bernie Sanders party bosses don't want become Democrat standard bearer in July? Or will Joe Biden or another high-profile party member perhaps be chosen as a late-stage establishment nominee, a brokered convention manipulating things? America's political system is too debauched to fix. Duopoly power eliminates governance of, by and for everyone equitably. Republicans and Democrats are two sides of the same coin – special interests served exclusively, ordinary people betrayed, the same outcome every electoral cycle. Whoever succeeds Obama, likely worse than ever governance will follow. The greatest concern is preventing possible WW III. Clinton's rage for endless wars, along with her Sino/Russian hostility makes the unthinkable possible. Stephen Lendman lives in Chicago. He can be reached at .

By Rahul Manchanda, Esq. on October 30, 2016 The Neo-Con/Communist natives are restless, they desperately want their World War 3, and they are wanting to move their wealth and power to their next world empire, which will be the final one in their sick deluded minds, unopposed and permanent. 
Never in America's history has she been in more danger of a 'false flag” attack from her enemies, both foreign and domestic, than she is now. 
The contemporary term 'false flag” describes covert operations that are designed to deceive in such a way that the operations appear as though they are being carried out by entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them. 
Historically, the term 'false flag” had its origins in naval warfare where the use of a flag other than the belligerent's true battle flag before (but not while) engaging the enemy has long been accepted as a permissible ruse de guerre ; by contrast, flying a false flag while engaging the enemy constitutes 'perfidy.” 
Operations carried out during peace-time by civilian organizations, as well as covert government agencies, can (by extension) also be called false flag operations if they seek to hide the real organization behind an operation. 
America has been thoroughly infiltrated by a mighty and wealthy foreign power and menace, while her people are suffering financially, and she is now poised to be sacrificed on the altar of history for a one world government headquartered overseas. 
The Neo-Con/Communist natives are restless, they desperately want their World War 3, and they are wanting to move their wealth and power to their next world empire, which will be the final one in their sick deluded minds, unopposed and permanent. 
Now that Hillary Clinton has been 'theoretically re-indicted” by the FBI for the email scandals (although they are being obstructed by our very own US Department of 'Justice” under Attorney General Loretta Lynch) this has effectively ruined her chances of becoming President through legal channels, so they only have one more option – and that is a false flag attack leading us directly into World War 3 in a nuclear war, using all of their carefully placed traitors in the Pentagon, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice, and cooperative local police departments all throughout the United States, with a declaration of a state of emergency in both the United States, and abroad. 
This is why it is vitally important that all Americans, both in the private and public sector, start watching their government and elected leaders like 'hawks.” 
Americans need to use the Neo-Con's mantra of 'See Something, Say Something” against them. 
The Neo-Con/Stasi/Communist's Zersetzung (organized gang-stalking under Bill Clinton's Community Oriented Policing 'COPS” program) needs to be turned by the People against them, and the American People need to watch each and every single one of them like they would watch a lunatic holding an AK-47 in a mall. 
The Neo-Cons simply can not be trusted, as they work for the Plutocrats, who desperately want to hold on to their power, and will not willingly relinquish it to the People by way of Donald Trump and his Populist Revolt and Uprising. 
Some examples of real false flags throughout history having routinely disastrous results, wherein the 'winners” re-wrote history, include the: 
(1) 1914 Battle of Trindade fought between the British auxiliary cruiser RMS Carmania and the German auxiliary cruiser SMS Cap Trafalgar which had been altered to look like Carmania; 
(2) World War II German commerce raider Kormoran which surprised and sank the Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney in 1941 while disguised as a Dutch merchant ship, causing the greatest recorded loss of life on an Australian warship; 
(3) trial of Otto Skorzeny, who planned and commanded Operation Greif, by a U.S. military tribunal at the Dachau Trials included a finding that Skorzeny was not guilty of a crime by ordering his men into action in American uniforms; 
(4) 1788 incident wherein the head tailor at the Royal Swedish Opera received an order to sew a number of Russian military uniforms to stage an attack on Puumala, a Swedish outpost on the Russo-Swedish border allowing King Gustav III of Sweden, who lacked the constitutional authority to initiate unprovoked hostilities without the Estates' consent, to launch the Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790); 
(5) September 1931 incident wherein Japanese officers fabricated a pretext for invading Manchuria by blowing up a section of railway; 
(6) Gleiwitz incident in 1939 involving Reinhard Heydrich fabricating evidence of a Polish attack against Germany to mobilize German public opinion for war with Poland; 
(7) November 26, 1939 incident wherein the Soviet army shelled Mainila, a Russian village near the Finnish border blaming Finland for the attack using the incident as a pretext to invade Finland, starting the Winter War, four days later; 
(8) 1962 Operation Northwoods plot by the U.S. Department of Defense for a war with Cuba involving scenarios such as fabricating the hijacking or shooting down of passenger and military planes, sinking a U.S. ship in the vicinity of Cuba, burning crops, sinking a boat filled with Cuban refugees, attacks by alleged Cuban infiltrators inside the United States, and harassment of U.S. aircraft and shipping and the destruction of aerial drones by aircraft disguised as Cuban MiGs to be blamed on Cuba and a pretext for an invasion of Cuba and the overthrow of Fidel Castro's communist government; 
(9) Reichstag fire which was an arson attack on the Reichstag building in Berlin on February 27, 1933 using as 'evidence” by the Nazis that the Communists were beginning a plot against the German government, whereby Adolf Hitler, who was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany four weeks before, on 30 January, urged President Paul von Hindenburg to pass an emergency decree to counter the 'ruthless confrontation of the Communist Party of Germany” – with civil liberties suspended, the government instituted mass arrests of Communists, including all of the Communist parliamentary delegates; 
(10) April 4 1953 incident wherein the CIA was ordered to undermine the government of Iran over a four-month period, as a precursor to overthrowing Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh by carrying out false flag attacks 'on mosques and key public figures” to be blamed on Iranian communists loyal to the government, code-named 'TP-Ajax,” the tactic of a 'directed campaign of bombings by Iranians posing as members of the Communist party” involving the bombing of 'at least” one well known Muslim's house by CIA agents posing as Communists; 
(11) 2008 shooting of two minibuses carrying Georgians who lived in Abkhazia who wanted to cross the border so they could go and vote in the parliamentary election that day, in a volatile area on the border of Abkhazia and the Republic of Georgia, wherein President Saakashvili indicated that the attack had been an attempt to disrupt the election, implying that it had been Abkhaz or Russian forces who had been behind it, providing a favorable opportunity for the president to focus the nation's attention on an external enemy, leading attention away from his domestic critics, as well as making use of his position as leader to rally the Georgians around his candidates in the election; 
(12) assassination of Charlemagne Péralte of Haiti in 1919, after checkpoints were passed by military disguised as guerrilla fighters; 
(13) Mau Mau uprising in the 1950s, wherein captured Mau Mau members who switched sides and specially trained British troops initiated the pseudo-gang concept to successfully counter Mau Mau; 
(14) Algerian civil war in the middle of 1994 wherein death squads composed of Département du Renseignement et de la Sécurité (DRS) security forces disguised themselves as Islamist terrorists and committed false flag terror attacks; 
(15) Mexican wars of 1819 and 1846-48; 
(16) Spanish-American War of 1898 involving the surprise explosion of the battleship Maine at Havana, Cuba wherein the Hearst Press accused the Spanish and the USA declared war on Spain conquering the Philippines, Guam and Cuba; 
(17) World War I in 1914-1918 wherein a U-boat torpedo hit ocean liner Lusitania near Britain and some 1200 people, including 128 Americans, on board lost their lives, and subsequent investigations revealed that the major explosions were inside the Lusitania, as it was secretly transporting 6 million pounds of artillery shells and rifle ammunition, as well as other explosives on behalf of Morgan Banking Corporation to help Britain and France; 
(18) World War 2 in 1939-1945 where a U-boat torpedo hit the ocean liner Athenia near Britain with some 1100 passengers, of which 311 were Americans; 
(19) US naval intelligence planning and suggesting '8 insults” to bring Japan into war with the US, and where President Roosevelt executed this plan immediately and also added some other insults, enraging Japan, such as a total blockade of Japanese oil imports, as agreed between the Americans, British and the Dutch – FDR also declared an all-out embargo against Japan and forbade them the use of the Panama Canal impeding Japan's access to Venezuelan oil; 
(20) one of many incidents provoking Japan to attack Pearl Harbor some 6 months later; 
(21) Korean War in 1950-1953 wherein South Korean incursions (the Tiger regiment etc.) into North Korea (1949) led to contrary claims and into war – the cause of this war was covert action involving leaders of Taiwan, South Korea and the US Military Industrial Complex (John Foster Dulles has been mentioned as an organizer of the hostilities); 
(22) Vietnam War in 'The Gulf of Tonkin Incident” wherein the American destroyer Maddox was supposedly attacked twice by three North Vietnamese torpedo boats in 1964 in the Gulf of Tonkin – but which never happened; 
(23) Grenada invasion whereby the Grenadian leader, Maurice Bishop, who favored the left and invited Cubans to build infrastructure to accommodate long range Soviet aircraft was deposed and executed in October 19, 1983 – six days later the US invaded, with the supposed reason that American medical students studying in Grenada were in danger due to a 'Cuban presence”– and of course the new leader supported by the US favored more traditional values and the right; 
(24) Panama invasion wherein an incident between American and Panamanian troops led to invasion and the earlier Carter administration plan to hand control of the canal over to Panama was cancelled; 
(25) US-Israeli sponsored wars between Iraq and Iran from 1980-1988; 
(26) Desert Storm War (First Gulf War) in 1991 wherein Saddam Hussein asked for permission from the US (via their ambassador April Gillespie) to invade Kuwait, and got an answer that the US was not concerned with 'Arab quarrels” – this was a trap, and after Saddam occupied Kuwait, George Bush Sr. mobilized a coalition of some 40 nations to 'liberate Kuwait” and smash the recently-built Iraqi military power base – this incident also involved a media hoax wherein the daughter of a Kuwaiti US Ambassador played a nurse on TV and testified to 'witnessing” Iraqi soldiers throwing babies out of incubators in Kuwait; 
(27) War on Terror launched by the Bush administration in October 2001 – claimed to be the response to terrorism, especially the 9-11 incidents; 
(28) Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan invasion); 
(29) Enduring Justice (Second Gulf war); and 
(30) countless others. 
Paragraph 43 of the Field Manual published by the War Department, United States Army, on 1 October 1940, under the entry Rules of Land Warfare states: 
'National flags, insignias and uniforms as a ruse – in practice it has been authorized to make use of these as a ruse. The foregoing rule (Article 23 of the Annex of the IVth Hague Convention), does not prohibit such use, but does prohibit their improper use. It is certainly forbidden to make use of them during a combat. Before opening fire upon the enemy, they must be discarded.” 
The American Soldiers' Handbook states: 
'The use of the enemy flag, insignia, and uniform is permitted under some circumstances. They are not to be used during actual fighting, and if used in order to approach the enemy without drawing fire, should be thrown away or removed as soon as fighting begins.” 
The 1977 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949 (Protocol I) states: 
Article 37. – Prohibition of perfidy – 1. It is prohibited to kill, injure, or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy. Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy. The following acts are examples of perfidy: (a) The feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender; (b) The feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness; (c) The feigning of civilian, non-combatant status; and (d) The feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict. 2. Ruses of war are not prohibited. Such ruses are acts which are intended to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but which infringe no rule of international law applicable in armed conflict and which are not perfidious because they do not invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under that law. The following are examples of such ruses: the use of camouflage, decoys, mock operations and disinformation. 
Article 38. – Recognized emblems – 1. It is prohibited to make improper use of the distinctive emblem of the Red Cross, Red Crescent or Red Lion and Sun or of other emblems, signs or signals provided for by the Conventions or by this Protocol. It is also prohibited to misuse deliberately in an armed conflict other internationally recognized protective emblems, signs or signals, including the flag of truce, and the protective emblem of cultural property. 2. It is prohibited to make use of the distinctive emblem of the United Nations, except as authorized by that Organization. 
Article 39. – Emblems of nationality – 1. It is prohibited to make use in an armed conflict of the flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict. 2. It is prohibited to make use of the flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of adverse Parties while engaging in attacks or in order to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations. 3. Nothing in this Article or in Article 37, paragraph 1(d), shall affect the existing generally recognized rules of international law applicable to espionage or to the use of flags in the conduct of armed conflict at sea.” 
It is vitally important to note that while the United States may have these codes and regulations, her enemies, both foreign and domestic, are not bound by these Rules. 
The American People (and indeed the rest of the world) need to be exceptionally on guard and vigilant before the upcoming November 2016 election, and even many months afterwards, because the Neo-Cons/Communists may still try and get their World War 3, even if Donald Trump is elected. 
After all, September 11, 2001 took place a full 9 months after George W Bush was sworn in at his Inauguration in January 2001, and this was blamed on Osama Bin Laden who was a known CIA Asset and who allegedly declared War on America in 1998 – he might have been the Neo-Cons' insurance plan, cooked up during the 8 year Clinton Administration from 1992-2000. 
And of course, 9-11 is what led to the wholesale bloodshed and regime changing wars for the past 15 years, leaving the Middle East in flames, with countless millions of innocent lives and refugees lost forever, the greatest genocide and bloodbath the world has ever known. 
And don't think that these crazed Neo-Con psychopaths won't do it again, especially when there are only a few more countries left to 'take out” now – Russia, Iran, and North Korea – as opposed to 20.

By Rebecca Burgess, Gary J. Schmitt 
George Washington's assertion that 'When we assumed the Soldier, we did not lay aside the Citizen” is justly famous for capturing the traditional attitude of the American citizen-soldier. While the nation at times has requested or required that citizens to fulfill the highest form of civic duty, there have always been individuals who have voluntarily donned its uniform. Viewing military service as a form of public service, many, not surprisingly, have followed their days in the military by pursuing other forms of civic service, notably in the halls of government. 
Although American democracy demands a military-civilian divide in regard to political power, voters have shown they are comfortable with electing officials with military service on their resume. Indeed, despite the colonists' Revolutionary-era complaints about the British conflating military and political power, of the first 25 men to become president, 21 had military experience.

by Rahul Manchanda, Esq. 
Never in America's history has she been in more danger of a 'false flag” attack from her enemies, both foreign and domestic, than she is now. 
The contemporary term 'false flag” describes covert operations that are designed to deceive in such a way that the operations appear as though they are being carried out by entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them. 
Historically, the term 'false flag” had its origins in naval warfare where the use of a flag other than the belligerent's true battle flag before (but not while) engaging the enemy has long been accepted as a permissible ruse de guerre ; by contrast, flying a false flag while engaging the enemy constitutes 'perfidy.” 
Operations carried out during peace-time by civilian organizations, as well as covert government agencies, can (by extension) also be called false flag operations if they seek to hide the real organization behind an operation. 
America has been thoroughly infiltrated by a mighty and wealthy foreign power and menace, while her people are suffering financially, and she is now poised to be sacrificed on the altar of history for a one world government headquartered overseas. 
The Neo-Con/Communist natives are restless, they desperately want their World War 3, and they are wanting to move their wealth and power to their next world empire, which will be the final one in their sick deluded minds, unopposed and permanent.   
Now that Hillary Clinton has been 'theoretically re-indicted” by the FBI for the email scandals (although they are being obstructed by our very own US Department of 'Justice” under Attorney General Loretta Lynch) this has effectively ruined her chances of becoming President through legal channels, so they only have one more option – and that is a false flag attack leading us directly into World War 3 in a nuclear war, using all of their carefully placed traitors in the Pentagon, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice, and cooperative local police departments all throughout the United States, with a declaration of a state of emergency in both the United States, and abroad. 
This is why it is vitally important that all Americans, both in the private and public sector, start watching their government and elected leaders like 'hawks.” 
Americans need to use the Neo-Con's mantra of 'See Something, Say Something” against them. 
The Neo-Con/Stasi/Communist's Zersetzung (organized gang-stalking under Bill Clinton's Community Oriented Policing 'COPS” program) needs to be turned by the People against them, and the American People need to watch each and every single one of them like they would watch a lunatic holding an AK-47 in a mall. 'Regime Change” Brigade 
The Neo-Cons simply can not be trusted, as they work for the Plutocrats, who desperately want to hold on to their power, and will not willingly relinquish it to the People by way of Donald Trump and his Populist Revolt and Uprising. 
Some examples of real false flags throughout history having routinely disastrous results, wherein the 'winners” re-wrote history, include the: 
(1) 1914 Battle of Trindad fought between the British auxiliary cruiser RMS Carmania and the German auxiliary cruiser SMS Cap Trafalgar which had been altered to look like Carmania; 
(2) World War II German commerce raider Kormoran which surprised and sank the Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney in 1941 while disguised as a Dutch merchant ship, causing the greatest recorded loss of life on an Australian warship; 
(3) trial of Otto Skorzeny, who planned and commanded Operation Greif, by a U.S. military tribunal at the Dachau Trials included a finding that Skorzeny was not guilty of a crime by ordering his men into action in American uniforms; 
(4) 1788 incident wherein the head tailor at the Royal Swedish Opera received an order to sew a number of Russian military uniforms to stage an attack on Puumala, a Swedish outpost on the Russo-Swedish border allowing King Gustav III of Sweden, who lacked the constitutional authority to initiate unprovoked hostilities without the Estates' consent, to launch the Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790); 
(5) September 1931 incident wherein Japanese officers fabricated a pretext for invading Manchuria by blowing up a section of railway; 
(6) Gleiwitz incident in 1939 involving Reinhard Heydrich fabricating evidence of a Polish attack against Germany to mobilize German public opinion for war with Poland; 
(7) November 26, 1939 incident wherein the Soviet army shelled Mainila, a Russian village near the Finnish border blaming Finland for the attack using the incident as a pretext to invade Finland, starting the Winter War, four days later; 
(8) 1962 Operation Northwoods plot by the U.S. Department of Defense for a war with Cuba involving scenarios such as fabricating the hijacking or shooting down of passenger and military planes, sinking a U.S. ship in the vicinity of Cuba, burning crops, sinking a boat filled with Cuban refugees, attacks by alleged Cuban infiltrators inside the United States, and harassment of U.S. aircraft and shipping and the destruction of aerial drones by aircraft disguised as Cuban MiGs to be blamed on Cuba and a pretext for an invasion of Cuba and the overthrow of Fidel Castro's communist government; 
(9) Reichstag fire which was an arson attack on the Reichstag building in Berlin on February 27, 1933 using as 'evidence” by the Nazis that the Communists were beginning a plot against the German government, whereby Adolf Hitler, who was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany four weeks before, on 30 January, urged President Paul von Hindenburg to pass an emergency decree to counter the 'ruthless confrontation of the Communist Party of Germany” – with civil liberties suspended, the government instituted mass arrests of Communists, including all of the Communist parliamentary delegates; 
(10) April 4 1953 incident wherein the CIA was ordered to undermine the government of Iran over a four-month period, as a precursor to overthrowing Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh by carrying out false flag attacks 'on mosques and key public figures” to be blamed on Iranian communists loyal to the government, code-named 'TP-Ajax,” the tactic of a 'directed campaign of bombings by Iranians posing as members of the Communist party” involving the bombing of 'at least” one well known Muslim's house by CIA agents posing as Communists; 
(11) 2008 shooting of two minibuses carrying Georgians who lived in Abkhazia who wanted to cross the border so they could go and vote in the parliamentary election that day, in a volatile area on the border of Abkhazia and the Republic of Georgia, wherein President Saakashvili indicated that the attack had been an attempt to disrupt the election, implying that it had been Abkhaz or Russian forces who had been behind it, providing a favorable opportunity for the president to focus the nation's attention on an external enemy, leading attention away from his domestic critics, as well as making use of his position as leader to rally the Georgians around his candidates in the election; 
(12) assassination of Charlemagne Péralte of Haiti in 1919, after checkpoints were passed by military disguised as guerrilla fighters; 
(13) Mau Mau uprising in the 1950s, wherein captured Mau Mau members who switched sides and specially trained British troops initiated the pseudo-gang concept to successfully counter Mau Mau; 
(14) Algerian civil war in the middle of 1994 wherein death squads composed of Département du Renseignement et de la Sécurité (DRS) security forces disguised themselves as Islamist terrorists and committed false flag terror attacks; 
(15) Mexican wars of 1819 and 1846-48; 
(16) Spanish-American War of 1898 involving the surprise explosion of the battleship Maine at Havana, Cuba wherein the Hearst Press accused the Spanish and the USA declared war on Spain conquering the Philippines, Guam and Cuba; 
(17) World War I in 1914-1918 wherein a U-boat torpedo hit ocean liner Lusitania near Britain and some 1200 people, including 128 Americans, on board lost their lives, and subsequent investigations revealed that the major explosions were inside the Lusitania, as it was secretly transporting 6 million pounds of artillery shells and rifle ammunition, as well as other explosives on behalf of Morgan Banking Corporation to help Britain and France; 
(18) World War 2 in 1939-1945 where a U-boat torpedo hit the ocean liner Athenia near Britain with some 1100 passengers, of which 311 were Americans; 
(19) US naval intelligence planning and suggesting '8 insults” to bring Japan into war with the US, and where President Roosevelt executed this plan immediately and also added some other insults, enraging Japan, such as a total blockade of Japanese oil imports, as agreed between the Americans, British and the Dutch – FDR also declared an all-out embargo against Japan and forbade them the use of the Panama Canal impeding Japan's access to Venezuelan oil; 
(20) one of many incidents provoking Japan to attack Pearl Harbor some 6 months later; 
(21) Korean War in 1950-1953 wherein South Korean incursions (the Tiger regiment etc.) into North Korea (1949) led to contrary claims and into war – the cause of this war was covert action involving leaders of Taiwan, South Korea and the US Military Industrial Complex (John Foster Dulles has been mentioned as an organizer of the hostilities); 
(22) Vietnam War in 'The Gulf of Tonkin Incident” wherein the American destroyer Maddox was supposedly attacked twice by three North Vietnamese torpedo boats in 1964 in the Gulf of Tonkin – but which never happened; 
(23) Grenada invasion whereby the Grenadian leader, Maurice Bishop, who favored the left and invited Cubans to build infrastructure to accommodate long range Soviet aircraft was deposed and executed in October 19, 1983 – six days later the US invaded, with the supposed reason that American medical students studying in Grenada were in danger due to a 'Cuban presence”– and of course the new leader supported by the US favored more traditional values and the right; 
(24) Panama invasion wherein an incident between American and Panamanian troops led to invasion and the earlier Carter administration plan to hand control of the canal over to Panama was cancelled; 
(25) US-Israeli sponsored wars between Iraq and Iran from 1980-1988; 
(26) Desert Storm War (First Gulf War) in 1991 wherein Saddam Hussein asked for permission from the US (via their ambassador April Gillespie) to invade Kuwait, and got an answer that the US was not concerned with 'Arab quarrels” – this was a trap, and after Saddam occupied Kuwait, George Bush Sr. mobilized a coalition of some 40 nations to 'liberate Kuwait” and smash the recently-built Iraqi military power base – this incident also involved a media hoax wherein the daughter of a Kuwaiti US Ambassador played a nurse on TV and testified to 'witnessing” Iraqi soldiers throwing babies out of incubators in Kuwait; 
(27) War on Terror launched by the Bush administration in October 2001 – claimed to be the response to terrorism, especially the 9-11 incidents; 
(28) Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan invasion); 
(29) Enduring Justice (Second Gulf war); and 
(30) countless others. 
Paragraph 43 of the Field Manual published by the War Department, United States Army, on 1 October 1940, under the entry Rules of Land Warfare states: 'National flags, insignias and uniforms as a ruse – in practice it has been authorized to make use of these as a ruse. The foregoing rule (Article 23 of the Annex of the IVth Hague Convention), does not prohibit such use, but does prohibit their improper use. It is certainly forbidden to make use of them during a combat. Before opening fire upon the enemy, they must be discarded.” 
The American Soldiers' Handbook states: 'The use of the enemy flag, insignia, and uniform is permitted under some circumstances. They are not to be used during actual fighting, and if used in order to approach the enemy without drawing fire, should be thrown away or removed as soon as fighting begins.” 
The 1977 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949 (Protocol I) states: 
Article 37. – Prohibition of perfidy – 1. It is prohibited to kill, injure, or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy. Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy. The following acts are examples of perfidy: (a) The feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender; (b) The feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness; (c) The feigning of civilian, non-combatant status; and (d) The feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict. 2. Ruses of war are not prohibited. Such ruses are acts which are intended to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but which infringe no rule of international law applicable in armed conflict and which are not perfidious because they do not invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under that law. The following are examples of such ruses: the use of camouflage, decoys, mock operations and disinformation. 
Article 38. – Recognized emblems – 1. It is prohibited to make improper use of the distinctive emblem of the Red Cross, Red Crescent or Red Lion and Sun or of other emblems, signs or signals provided for by the Conventions or by this Protocol. It is also prohibited to misuse deliberately in an armed conflict other internationally recognized protective emblems, signs or signals, including the flag of truce, and the protective emblem of cultural property. 2. It is prohibited to make use of the distinctive emblem of the United Nations, except as authorized by that Organization. 
Article 39. – Emblems of nationality – 1. It is prohibited to make use in an armed conflict of the flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict. 2. It is prohibited to make use of the flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of adverse Parties while engaging in attacks or in order to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations. 3. Nothing in this Article or in Article 37, paragraph 1(d), shall affect the existing generally recognized rules of international law applicable to espionage or to the use of flags in the conduct of armed conflict at sea.” 
It is vitally important to note that while the United States may have these codes and regulations, her enemies, both foreign and domestic, are not bound by these Rules.

What Is At Stake In This Election — Paul Craig Roberts ‹ › Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. The Clinton Crime Family. 'Hillary is the Most Dangerous Presidential Aspirant in US History” By VNN on October 30, 2016 Hillary is the most recklessly dangerous presidential aspirant in US history, 
by Stephen Lendman 
The Bill and Hillary crime family long ago should have been held accountable for high crimes against peace and numerous others. Hillary is the most recklessly dangerous presidential aspirant in US history, supporting endless imperial wars and state terror, once saying '(w)hat do we have NATO for if not to defend our way of life.” There was never a war Hillary did not support – Crimes against Humanity She endorses first-strike nuclear weapons use, calling them peacekeeping deterrents, mindless of their power to destroy life on earth. She's militantly anti-Russia, earlier compared the nation to Nazi Germany, Putin to Hitler, claiming 'he doesn't have a soul,” has revanchist aims, wanting Russian greatness restored – all of the above a perversion of truth, not to mention a pretext to wage war on Russia. The so-called Clinton Foundation is a suspected criminal enterprise, masquerading as a charitable NGO. It promotes Big Lies about 'improving global health, increasing opportunity for women and girls, reducing childhood obesity and preventable diseases, (as well as) creating economic opportunity and growth…” Film producer Frank Huguenard believes Hillary Clinton faces impending federal racketeering charges under the 1970 Racketeering Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Enacted to fight organized and white collar crime, racketeering is defined to include fraud, bribery, money laundering, embezzlement, drugs trafficking, murder, and various other offenses under the Federal criminal code (Title 18), even acts of terrorism. According to Huguenard, Obama-appointed FBI chief James Comey will recommend Attorney General Loretta Lynch treat 'the Clinton Foundation (as) an ongoing criminal enterprise engaged in money laundering and soliciting bribes in exchange for political, policy and legislative favors to individuals, corporations and even governments both foreign and domestic.” Morning Joe Destroys Corrupt Clinton Foundation – 'Total Corruption” Strong stuff if only partly true! Huguenard cites credible evidence, indicating the Clinton Foundation is largely a money laundering, influence peddling racket. Less than 10% of 'tens of millions of dollars donated” went for charitable purposes, the rest for self-enrichment. 'There is ample evidence already in the public record that the Clinton Foundation qualifies as a criminal enterprise and there's no doubt that the FBI is privy to significantly more evidence than has already been made public,” said Huguenard. If Comey recommends Attorney General Lynch indict Hillary Clinton, it's unlikely she'll prosecute a woman she's had close ties to for years. Bill Clinton appointed her US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York – serving from 1999 – 2001. From 2003 – 2005, she was a Wall Street controlled New York Federal Reserve Bank of New York board member – the mother bank most complicit with its member bank crooks. From 2002 – 2010, she was a Washington-headquartered Hogan & Hartson (H & H) law firm partner. Its New York-based partner Howard Topaz filed income tax returns for Bill and Hillary Clinton, beginning in 2004. In May 2004, H & H filed patent trademark documents for Denver-based MX Logic Inc., the computer software firm responsible for developing email encryption technology used to manage Hillary's private email server, beginning in July 2013. Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton According to Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, if H & H (now Hogan Lovells following a 2010 merger) 'represented the Clintons on tax matters,” Lynch is responsible for disclosing any involvement she may have had, direct or indirect. In April 2008 during Hillary's first presidential campaign, The American Lawyer called H & H one of her largest legal industry supporters.   Partner Christine Varney was chief counsel to the Clinton/Gore 1992 campaign. The ties between H & H, Lynch and the Clintons are longstanding. In November 2014, Obama announced her appointment as attorney general, succeeding Eric Holder, effective April 27, 2015 after Senate confirmation. It's hard imagining her biting a hand contributing greatly to her career advancement. Key for Clinton is how much more of her dark side becomes public knowledge besides what's already known. If enough despite Lynch declining to indict and supportive media scoundrels downplaying or whitewashing her offenses, the Democratic (sic) National Committee (DNC) might be forced to jettison her as damaged goods. She'd be red meat for Trump to take full advantage of in the fall campaign. Would Bernie Sanders party bosses don't want become Democrat standard bearer in July? Or will Joe Biden or another high-profile party member perhaps be chosen as a late-stage establishment nominee, a brokered convention manipulating things? America's political system is too debauched to fix. Duopoly power eliminates governance of, by and for everyone equitably. Republicans and Democrats are two sides of the same coin – special interests served exclusively, ordinary people betrayed, the same outcome every electoral cycle. Whoever succeeds Obama, likely worse than ever governance will follow. The greatest concern is preventing possible WW III. Clinton's rage for endless wars, along with her Sino/Russian hostility makes the unthinkable possible. Stephen Lendman lives in Chicago. He can be reached at .

'One percent of World War II veterans are still with us in the population and we wanted to take an opportunity to express to them how meaningful their presence is to us while we have the opportunity,” said one of the organizers, Matthew Adams. 
He said he was the 'beauty” behind the operation, his fellow vet Thomas Demers, was the 'brains.”

Her writing has been featured in several print and online publications in the Middle East. She is committed to exposing (AIPAC) the Israel Lobby's control of American policy for the Middle East. Control which amounts to treason by the Zionist Lobbies in America and its stooges in Congress, and that guarantees there can never be a peaceful resolution of the Middle East conflicts, only catastrophe for all, in the region and the world. Her focus is Israel's drift towards greater oppression of the Palestinian people; the political deceptions and crisis in Syria and Ukraine; the cold hard facts about America's so-called 'war on terror' and grim future; countering the propaganda war towards Iran & Russia and calling attention to, the new, developing, promising, strategic alliances as a consequence. Her mission is to inform and educate the public on issues of the US/Middle East conflicts that are unreported, underreported, or distorted in the Zionist owned American Media.

Gowdy on the impact of the FBI's new Clinton inquiry By Debbie Menon on October 31, 2016 BRAVO! Rep. Gowdy. Senator Trey Gowdy is an American attorney, politician and former prosecutor. He currently serves as the U.S. Representative for South Carolina's 4th congressional district. 
Senator Trey Gowdy is right, timing is consequence of decisions Hillary made period. Jim Comey's obligation is to the public. 
Senator (Harry) Reid is simply 'just another” one of the political hacks who populate that massive brothel we call Capitol Hill. Senator Reid and others are aware of the treasonous and criminal nature of the Clintons. 
Hillary Clinton is probably guilty of many things which have not surfaced as openly or as clearly, so lets not scapegoat Huma Abedine and her husband. Hillary is obviously guilty as sin of malfeasance of office and negligence, for the very fact that she exposed her country's secrets to hackers, knowingly using a private server to conduct State Department business with the outside world and should be called to account for it. Period. 
It is people like Bill & Hillary who have become to Big to Fall and the basic problems and causes of the fundamental failures in US Government. Two of the major rotten apples in the barrel, and these are probably two of the most obvious who should be prosecuted not only as examples to the others, but for delivery of the justice which they have earned… and which the citizens of America deserve! 
Instead of rewarding them by returning them to the Oval office, they should be investigated, and they should be held accountable. Americans can live in a State of Law and Justice, or a State of suppression, injustice, corruption and subjugation to powerful politicians. It is their choice!

  A combat veteran with PTSD wasn't allowed to fly with her service dog. So she sued.   30, 2016 PTSD 
By Peter Holley 
Lisa McCombs, a decorated Army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, claims she'd never had any trouble flying with her service dog, a Labrador retriever named Jake. 
That changed one year ago, when she was barred from boarding a regional American Airlines flight with Jake, who was wearing his service vest and was properly documented at the time, according to a federal lawsuit. 
McCombs suffers from PTSD and relies on her dog to calm her anxiety and panic before it overwhelms her. 
But as she waited to board her return flight from Manhattan, Kansas, an airline agent approached her and asked 'in a condescending tone, 'ummm, are you going to fly with that ?'” the suit states.

  Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside By VNN on October 31, 2016 The newly opened FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server marks "a potential Constitutional crisis" for the country. 
Chicago Tribune 
Has America become so numb by the decades of lies and cynicism oozing from Clinton Inc. that it could elect Hillary Clinton as president, even after Friday's FBI announcement that it had reopened an investigation of her emails while secretary of state? 
We'll find out soon enough. 
It's obvious the American political system is breaking down. It's been crumbling for some time now, and the establishment elite know it and they're properly frightened. Donald Trump , the vulgarian at their gates, is a symptom, not a cause. Hillary Clinton and husband Bill are both cause and effect. 
FBI director James Comey 's announcement about the renewed Clinton email investigation is the bombshell in the presidential campaign. That he announced this so close to Election Day should tell every thinking person that what the FBI is looking at is extremely serious. 
This can't be about pervert Anthony Weiner and his reported desire for a teenage girl. But it can be about the laptop of Weiner's wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin , and emails between her and Hillary. It comes after the FBI investigation in which Comey concluded Clinton had lied and been 'reckless” with national secrets, but said he could not recommend prosecution. 
So what should the Democrats do now? 

If ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: 
They would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. 
Democrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. 
Since Oct. 7, WikiLeaks has released 35,000 emails hacked from Clinton campaign boss John Podesta . Now WikiLeaks, no longer a neutral player but an active anti-Clinton agency, plans to release another 15,000 emails. 
What if she is elected? Think of a nation suffering a bad economy and continuing chaos in the Middle East, and now also facing a criminal investigation of a president. Add to that congressional investigations and a public vision of Clinton as a Nixonian figure wandering the halls, wringing her hands. 
The best thing would be for Democrats to ask her to step down now. It would be the most responsible thing to do, if the nation were more important to them than power. And the American news media — fairly or not firmly identified in the public mind as Mrs. Clinton's political action committee — should begin demanding it. 
But what will Hillary do? 
She'll stick and ride this out and turn her anger toward Comey. For Hillary and Bill Clinton, it has always been about power, about the Clinton Restoration and protecting fortunes already made by selling nothing but political influence. 
She'll remind the nation that she's a woman and that Donald Trump said terrible things about women. If there is another notorious Trump video to be leaked, the Clintons should probably leak it now. Then her allies in media can talk about misogyny and sexual politics and the headlines can be all about Trump as the boor he is and Hillary as champion of female victims, which she has never been. 
Remember that Bill Clinton leveraged the 'Year of the Woman.” Then he preyed on women in the White House and Hillary protected him. But the political left — most particularly the women of the left — defended him because he promised to protect abortion rights and their other agendas. 
If you take a step back from tribal politics, you'll see that Mrs. Clinton has clearly disqualified herself from ever coming near classified information again. If she were a young person straight out of grad school hoping to land a government job, Hillary Clinton would be laughed out of Washington with her record. She'd never be hired. 
As secretary of state she kept classified documents on the home-brew server in her basement, which is against the law. She lied about it to the American people. She couldn't remember details dozens of times when questioned by the FBI. Her aides destroyed evidence by BleachBit and hammers. Her husband, Bill, met secretly on an airport tarmac with Attorney General Loretta Lynch for about a half-hour, and all they said they talked about was golf and the grandkids. 
And there was no prosecution of Hillary. 
That isn't merely wrong and unethical. It is poisonous. 
And during this presidential campaign, Americans were confronted with a two-tiered system of federal justice: one for standards for the Clintons and one for the peasants. 
I've always figured that, as secretary of state, Clinton kept her home-brew email server — from which foreign intelligence agencies could hack top secret information — so she could shield the influence peddling that helped make the Clintons several fortunes. 
The Clintons weren't skilled merchants. They weren't traders or manufacturers. The Clintons never produced anything tangible. They had no science, patents or devices to make them millions upon millions of dollars. FBI's Comey acted out of 'obligation' to lawmakers, fear of leak to media 
All they had to sell, really, was influence. And they used our federal government to leverage it. 
If a presidential election is as much about the people as it is about the candidates, then we'll learn plenty about ourselves in the coming days, won't we?

Senator Trey Gowdy is right, the timing is a direct and natural consequence of decisions Hillary made, period. 
Jim Comey's obligation is to the public. 
Senator (Harry) Reid is simply 'just another” one of the political hacks who populate that massive brothel we call Capitol Hill. Senator Reid and others are aware of the treasonous and criminal nature of the Clintons. 
Let's not divert and scapegoat Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband. Hillary Clinton is probably guilty of many things which have not surfaced as openly or as clearly, but Hillary is guilty as sin of malfeasance of office and negligence, for the very fact that she exposed her country's secrets to hackers, knowingly using a 'private server” to conduct State Department business with the outside world and should be called to account for it. Period. Gowdy: Clinton wiped her private server clean 
Comey told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. 
It is people like Bill & Hillary who have become 'Too Big to Fall” and the basic problems and causes of the fundamental failures in US Government. Two of the major rotten apples in the barrel, and these are probably two of the most obvious who should be prosecuted not only as examples to the others, but for delivery of the justice which they have earned…and which the citizens of America deserve! 
Instead of rewarding them by returning them to the Oval office, they should be investigated, and they should be held accountable. Americans can live in a State of Law and Justice, or a State of suppression, injustice, corruption and subjugation to powerful politicians. It is their choice!

Citigroup bank chose Obama's 2008 cabinet – WikiLeaks By VNN on October 31, 2016 The single biggest beneficiary was Citigroup, which was given $45 billion in cash in the form of a government stock purchase, plus a $306 billion government guarantee to back up its worthless mortgage-related assets. Obama's cabinet – 2008 
WSWS.Org. 
One month before the presidential election of 2008, the giant Wall Street bank Citigroup submitted to the Obama campaign a list of its preferred candidates for cabinet positions in an Obama administration. This list corresponds almost exactly to the eventual composition of Barack Obama's cabinet. 
The memorandum, revealed by WikiLeaks in a recent document release from the email account of John Podesta, who currently serves as Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, was written by Michael Froman, who was then an executive with Citigroup and currently serves as US trade representative. The email is dated Oct. 6, 2008 and bears the subject line 'Lists.” It went to Podesta a month before he was named chairman of President-Elect Obama's transition team. Why is this Ex-Citigroup Executive Pushing TPP 'Fast Track”? 
The email was sent at the height of the financial meltdown that erupted after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15 . Even as Citigroup and its Wall Street counterparts were dragging the US and world economy into its deepest crisis since the 1930s, they remained, as the email shows, the real power behind the façade of American democracy and its electoral process. 
Froman's list proved remarkably prescient. As it proposed, Robert Gates, a Bush holdover, became secretary of Defense; Eric Holder became attorney general; Janet Napolitano, secretary of Homeland Security; Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff; Susan Rice, United Nations ambassador; Arne Duncan, secretary of Education; Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of Health and Human Services; Peter Orszag, head of the Office of Management and Budget; Eric Shinseki, secretary of Veterans Affairs; and Melody Barnes, chief of the Domestic Policy Council. 
For the highly sensitive position of secretary of the Treasury, three possibilities were presented: Robert Rubin and Rubin's close disciples Lawrence Summers and Timothy Geithner. Obama chose Geithner, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Geithner, along with Bush Treasury Secretary (and former Goldman Sachs CEO) Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, had played the leading role in organizing the Wall Street bailout. 
Rubin had served as Treasury secretary in the Bill Clinton administration from 1995 until 1999, when he was succeeded by Summers. In that capacity, Rubin and Summers oversaw the dismantling of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933), which had imposed a legal wall separating commercial banking from investment banking. Immediately after leaving Treasury, Rubin became a top executive at Citigroup, remaining there until 2009. 
A notable aspect of the Froman memo is its use of identity politics. Among the Citigroup executive's lists of proposed hires to Podesta were a 'Diversity List” including 'African American, Latino and Asian American candidates, broken down by Cabinet/Deputy and Under/Assistant/Deputy Assistant level,” in Froman's words, and 'a similar document on women.” Froman also took diversity into account for his White House cabinet list, 'probability-weighting the likelihood of appointing a diverse candidate for each position.” This list concluded with a table breaking down the 31 assignments by race and gender. 
Citigroup's recommendations came just three days after then-President George W. Bush signed into law the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which allocated $700 billion in taxpayer money to rescue the largest Wall Street banks. 
The single biggest beneficiary was Citigroup, which was given $45 billion in cash in the form of a government stock purchase, plus a $306 billion government guarantee to back up its worthless mortgage-related assets. The President and Wall Street – 2008 
Then-presidential candidate Obama played a critical political role in shepherding the massively unpopular bank bailout through Congress. 
The September financial crash convinced decisive sections of the US corporate-financial elite that the Democratic candidate of 'hope” and 'change” would be better positioned to contain popular opposition to the bailout than his Republican rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona. 
As president, Obama not only funneled trillions of dollars to the banks, he saw to it that not a single leading Wall Street executive faced prosecution for the orgy of speculation and swindling that led to the financial collapse and Great Recession, and he personally intervened to block legislation capping executive pay at bailed-out firms. 
The same furtive and corrupt process is underway in relation to a new U.S. administration. 
Froman's email is one of many thousands released by WikiLeaks from the account of Podesta. HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE'S 'PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER” HACKED 
Those communications, such as the Froman email, which expose who really rules America, have been virtually ignored by the media. 
The pro-Democratic Party New Republic called attention to it in an article published Friday , but the story has received little if any further coverage. 
The media has instead focused on salacious details of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's sexual activities, designed, in part, to divert attention from the substance of the Clinton campaign-related emails being released by WikiLeaks and other sources. 
The New Republic drew attention to the Froman memo not because it opposes such machinations, but as a warning to the interests it represents that they must move now to influence the eventual composition of a Hillary Clinton administration. 
'If the 2008 Podesta emails are any indication, the next four years of public policy are being hashed out right now, behind closed doors,” wrote New Republic author David Dayen. 'And if liberals want to have an impact on that process, waiting until after the election will be too late.”

A combat veteran with PTSD wasn't allowed to fly with her service dog.

Hillary Clinton's Wall Street Fundraising Benefited From Loophole In Federal Anti-Corruption Rule By VNN on October 31, 2016 'Particularly Vulnerable To Pay To Play Practices' 

by David Sirota AND Andrew Perez (MAPLIGHT) AND Avi Asher-Schapiro 
Despite an anti-corruption rule that was designed to reduce the financial industry's political power, top officials from the investment firm BlackRock hosted Hillary Clinton at campaign fundraisers earlier this year. The cash — which poured in through a loophole in the law — came in as BlackRock's federal contracts to manage billions of dollars of retiree assets will be up for renewal during the next president's term. 
In 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission looked to stop campaign donations to public officials from financial firms seeking to convince those officials to hire them to manage public employees' retirement assets. The agency enacted a pay-to-play rule that applied such a restriction to state and local officials. The rule, however, was structured in a way that effectively exempted federal agencies from its restrictions — and it was created even though a major federal agency had just been plagued by an investment-related influence-peddling scandal. 
In practice, the gap in the rule allows BlackRock executives to raise big money for presidential candidates who — if they win — will appoint the officials that run the federal Thrift Savings Plan, which awards contracts to manage retirement assets for nearly 5 million current and former federal employees. 
The loophole also allows Wall Street executives to give cash to presidential candidates, even as those executives' firms get deals to manage — and earn fees from — investments for the federal government's separate pension insurance agency, which is run by presidential appointees. 
In all, the loophole in the SEC rule effectively leaves nearly a half-trillion dollars of retirement assets unprotected by the nation's major anti-corruption measure. Clinton's presidential campaign has raised more than $1 million from financial firms that are contracted to manage those assets. 
Two SEC spokespeople, Ryan White and Judith Burns, declined to answer questions from International Business Times and MapLight about the pay-to-play rule carveout for federal agencies. 
'Particularly Vulnerable To Pay To Play Practices' 
This report is part of an IBT/MapLight series examining the extent to which corporate interests are able to circumvent federal and state anti-corruption rules designed to restrict the influence of money on public policy. 
When the SEC passed its rule to restrict Wall Street campaign contributions, the agency said the measure was necessary because publicly administered retirement programs 'are particularly vulnerable to pay to play practices” which can end up 'leading to inferior management, diminished returns or greater losses” for retirees. A study released last month validated that concern: Researchers at Stanford, Rice and Erasmus universities found that retirement systems whose overseers 'have received relatively more contributions from the financial industry have lower returns.” 
Federal regulators ended up prohibiting investment firms from earning fees from 'a government entity” — that is, a retirement system — if firm executives donate to a public official who has power to influence the retirement system's investment decisions. The rule, though, narrowly defined 'government entity”: It says the term means only an agency at the state or local level, not the federal government. 
'There's no clear carve-out for federal plans, but the definition itself also does not insinuate that they are covered,” Benjamin Keane, an attorney at the law firm Dentons, told IBT/MapLight. 
Through legislation, congressional lawmakers could close the loophole by passing a pay-to-play law that defined 'government entity” to encompass the federal government. Without that, the loophole will remain. 
'Wouldn't Appear To Put Such Firms At Risk' 
The result: Pay-to-play restrictions do not apply to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) — a $458 billion behemoth that is the single largest retirement system in America. 
BlackRock officials delivered over $100,000 to President Barack Obama's campaigns, and Obama's appointees to the TSP's board have awarded BlackRock contracts to manage $251 billion on behalf of millions of federal workers. Those contracts were awarded by the Obama administration between 2012 and 2015. 
Now, with those deals coming up for renewal, BlackRock employees are helping raise big money for Clinton, Obama's potential successor. 
BlackRock official Matt Mallow and his wife are listed on Clinton's website as 'Hillblazers” who have raised or donated at least $100,000 for the Democratic candidate's 2016 campaign. Mallow hosted a fundraiser for Clinton this past February. Cheryl Mills, a longtime Clinton adviser, also hosted a fundraiser for her and serves on BlackRock's board of directors. Clinton's campaign has received roughly $100,000 directly from employees of BlackRock. 
If Clinton wins the election, the agency her appointees run will decide the fate of BlackRock's TSP contracts — and there is nothing in the SEC pay-to-play rule to stop those appointees from rewarding Clinton's donors. 
'Since the Thrift Savings Plan is solely a creature of the federal government,” Keane told IBT/MapLight, 'contributions to the president or presidential candidates by covered executives of investment advisors to the TSP wouldn't appear to put such firms at risk.” 
A TSP spokesperson, Kim Weaver, confirmed to IBT/MapLight that 'the SEC has no jurisdiction” over the board that governs the retirement system. 
While TSP management contracts involve relatively low fees, the deals are coveted. The TSP does not publish an itemized list of the exact fees it pays to outside money managers, but documents reviewed by IBT show that the TSP pays about $106 million in annual expenses for the specific funds that BlackRock manages. 
BlackRock likely earns additional revenues through securities lending, in which it can lend out portfolio assets to other firms for a fee. BlackRock can also use TSP's holdings to exert influence with major corporations. 
Weaver said the agency 'uses a competitive RFP [request for proposal] process when selecting fund managers. The vendor is selected purely on the basis of best value and the selection is done on a fiduciary basis.” She said the agency's presidentially appointed board members 'do not serve as selecting officials on any [agency] procurement.” 
Federal law says the board sets 'policies for the investment and management” of the TSP, and agency press releases note that the board selected BlackRock for the four investment contracts the firm won. 
'Serious Questions About The Integrity Of The Process' 
The TSP is not the only source of investment business at the federal level: There is also the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation , which insures the pensions of 44 million Americans and pays out benefits if private pension systems collapse. PBGC officials currently oversee roughly $88 billion of investments. 
The PBGC ( Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation ) invests money with 23 financial firms, according to a PBGC spokesperson. Employees at twelve of those firms — including J.P. Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and BlackRock — have collectively given Clinton's presidential campaign more than $1.2 million. Goldman Sachs also paid Clinton $675,000 for speeches after she completed her tenure as Secretary of State. Those same firms donated over $870,000 to Obama's 2012 reelection campaign. 
The PBGC declined to disclose any information on how much in annual fees the agency pays the Wall Street firms, but there are clues about how much at least some of those firms might be making off the system. The agency's most recent financial report says roughly 1.7 percent of its assets are in 'private equity, private debt, and private real estate.” That translates to roughly $1.5 billion of such investments. Assuming industry standard fees of up to 2 percent, that one small slice of PBGC investments alone could generate up to $30 million of annual management fees for financial firms — on top of any additional fees levied on investment returns. 
Asked if it is appropriate for the agency to award contracts to firms whose executives make contributions to presidential campaigns, agency spokesman Marc Hopkins told IBT/MapLight: 'PBGC follows federal procurement laws and regulations.” 
The SEC's decision to shield the federal government from the pay-to-play rule is striking, given that the PBGC was engulfed in an influence-peddling scandal at the beginning of President Obama's term. 
In January 2009, Charles E.F. Millard resigned as head of the PBGC amid accusations he inappropriately communicated with firms who were courting lucrative PBGC contracts. A whistleblower told the agency's inspector general that Millard had been communicating with Wall Street firms seeking business from the PBGC, and that Millard refused to cut ties even after he was warned of potential ethical violations. 
The investigation found that BlackRock and Goldman Sachs assigned employees to win over Millard. BlackRock even tasked a former high school classmate of Millard's to keep in touch. 
Goldman provided Millard with advice about how to persuade his colleagues to invest more PBGC funds in alternative investments, and the PBGC soon picked BlackRock and Goldman to manage nearly $1.6 billion in PBGC assets. 
The inspector general said at the time that the 'improper actions raise serious questions about the integrity of the process by which the winners” of federal investment contracts were selected. The IG noted that after Millard resigned, a Goldman executive worked to help him find a Wall Street job. Millard — who was not criminally charged — worked as a managing director and head of pension relations at Citigroup until earlier this year. 
A few months after the IG report was released, President Obama appointed a private equity executive to take over the agency — just as that executive's New York firm was facing questions about whether it used political influence to secure public pension deals. A year later, the SEC passed its pay to play rule — including the language that made sure the rule did not apply to the PBGC and other federal agencies.

Vertical Pools Help Heal Wounded Combat Veterans Seeks Positive Doers To Help Make It Happen By VNN on October 31, 2016 The Vertical Pool was inspired by the anticipated need of the returning wounded, and veterans of all past conflicts, who have limited options for recovery and healing at home. Even if they're within an hour of a VA hospital, it can be a challenge to get there without assistance. A heated, sanitized, filtered, compact pool in the back yard, house, garage, means convenient, private, daily immersions for exercise, traction, rehabilitation, and recovery. These pools should be available to veterans without convoluted forms and wait times. Simply a doctor's prescription should put them on a list for immediate consideration. VetPools.org (an effort to raise funds to donate these pools to vets) was formed with the specific objective of helping improve upon the methods and manners by which America receives and treats her returning wounded. The most formidable military force in the world deserves a commensurate comprehensive recovery, reintegration program focused on body, mind, and spirit for those who require assistance. The purpose of this message is to inform interested and connected parties of the desire to hand this product and mission off to veterans who would then become The Vertical Pool LLC and VetPools.org . They could be instrumental in healing themselves and their fellow veterans, as well as civilian America from the physically challenged to the physically fit. Interestingly, while initially intended for veterans, the retail market has turned out to be women. As only one person, innovator/owner of The Vertical Pool and founder/director of VetPools.org , I cannot fulfill this objective alone. The R&D, pool product, and non-profit are all paid for in full, no debt or encumbrances. This 'on-demand” pool can be manufactured as needed without excessive, costly inventory and/or storage space. I do not advertise this product because one person cannot build, deliver, and install more than 5 pools in two months. Career options with this DME device and non-profit include owning, manufacturing, marketing, selling, donating, fund-raising, case managing, delivering, installing, and teaching The Vertical Pool's diverse functions and benefits. This pool is efficient in energy, water, and space; critical qualities in this, the 21st century. A group or collective of 3 to 7 individuals might be prudent to start the program. I would remain teacher, mentor, and guide for years to come while others slip into the ownership of this product and its sister non-profit organization. Please share this idea with any and all contacts who might have the connections to give some veterans a lead to a worthy endeavor and career. To get involved contact; Director, Peter G. Hold

BREAKING ALL THE RULES hosts SARTRE Commentary. BATR.org and BATR.net Only Demented Imbeciles want a Killary Reign of Terror By Sartre on November 1, 2016 
The cross section of Hillary Clinton voters is a mixture of walking dead zombies, power hungry influence peddlers, money cartel thieves and establishment diehards willing to start a global confrontation to postpone an inevitable economic collapse. As for the first category; welfare recipients, government bootlickers and mentally deranged utopians survive in a subsistence existence or in a fantasy illusion. The corruption purveyors simply want to maintain their elitist system of institutional inequality. As for the tribe of international finance, their objective always remains the same. Pick the next stooge who can be controlled. Finally, for globalist who are frantic to continue their New World Order of worldwide oppression, the elevation of Hillary Clinton to the position of the mad hatter to achieve the mutual assured destruction that these Illuminati's masters of the universe require to purge the 'Little People” from the planet. 
Any opposition to this band of desperate and deranged desperados is portrayed as racist, xenophobic and defiant of the 'Politically Correct” secular humanism culture. Here is the fundamental point of the conflict. The abandonment of the cannons of natural and common law has produced a didactic ineptness that thrusts humanity into a technocratic prison of a meaningless existence. Dante's Inferno of basic extinction is the ultimate society that a capitulation to the rigged electoral fraud seeks to achieve. 
The bloody record of Killary Clinton earns her an especially prominent place in hell. Take your choice. She may descend into Level 7 , for 'The violent, the assasins, the tyrants, and the war-mongers lament their pitiless mischiefs in the river, while centaurs armed with bows and arrows shoot those who try to escape their punishment” or Level 8- the Malebolge where 'The magicians, diviners, fortune tellers, and panderers are all here, as are the thieves”. 
Of course this allegory of punishment falls on deaf ears for the Clintonistas . For them this blameless role model for social justice warriors can do no wrong. All the evidence and proof in the world is ignored or dismissed when your patron saint of the occult wears pants suits. 
The reason HRC is better known as Killary has a lot to do with the body count that follows her around. THE CLINTON BODY-COUNT and the 'CLINTON DEATH LIST': 33 SPINE-TINGLING CASES lists several of her enemies that dared defy the queen of mean. Now are these suspicious circumstances of such deaths just another right-wing conspiracy to bring down the Arkancide crime syndicate? 
To an objective investigator, engaging into an in-depth probe might just get one added to this long list. But why would a Clinton supporter care, she is the epitome of the liberated woman and placing her on the throne of feminism is far overdue. Accepting, if not savoring a little reign of terror is a small price to pay as long as the body count does not include your own person. 
During the French Revolution the sanguinary women, known as Tricoteuse , who sat and knitted while attending public guillotine executions have more in common with Robespierre than Marie Antoinette. These devotee libbers identified with the symbol of equality, while their crowned head of elitism disdainfully admonish the peasants: 'Qu'ils mangent de la brioche”. 
Queen Marie Antoinette may not have really said, 'Let them eat cake” but the regnant of the House of Clinton demonstrates throughout her entire life revealed her true sentiments; despise and contempt for the 'Little People”. 
The knitting culture of the zombies cult of progressive authoritarianism is at the center of the public psychosis that follows the dictates of Hillary Clinton. Their identity is so caught up in the myth of collectivism that the very spirit of individual liberty is a necessary causality to join the Clinton demon worship. 
Look to the fictional character of Madame Defarge penned in A Tale of Two Cities for a synopsis of all that is wrong with Killary and her followers. Charles Dickens presents this viewpoint of the quintessential monster. 
'Her problem, it seems, is that Madame Defarge just doesn't know where to draw the line. As far as she's concerned, 'justice” for the fate of her family isn't just that the Marquis gets murdered. Justice should, she thinks, include the 'extermination” of all of the Marquis's family. Given her druthers, Charles, Lucie, and even little Lucie would fall under the sharp blade of La Guillotine. As Madame Defarge exclaims to her husband, 'Tell the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!” (3.12.36). 
'It was nothing to her that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself.” (3.14.33) 
So it comes as no surprise that when 'The meeting between Lucie and Madame Defarge makes this absolutely clear: Lucie falls on her knees, begging for mercy on behalf of her child. Madame Defarge stares at her coldly. She doesn't even stop knitting.” 
This example of the dark side of human nature is particularly relevant and applicable when analyzing the gender iniquity of the wicked witch. For femininity enablement to champion such abuse from a coldhearted degenerate is the biggest disappointment of this election cycle. Society should never condone or provide consent for anyone, male or female; who is such a habitual sociopath. 
The influence hucksters do not pretend to be altruistic . They would support Lucifer if they thought they would gain the riches of this world. As for the money changers, they are already archfiends in the Synagogue of Satan. Lastly, the globalist's warmongers covet the mass eradication of billions to satisfy their lust for world transcendence. 
These three factions are the true irredeemables. The masses of the walking dead need to politically repent and seek civic redemption. This objective is not possible by voting for Hillary Clinton. 
If you do nothing else before the November 8, 2016 election watch the video, A Vote For Hillary is a Vote For World War 3 . No matter your ideological propensities, we all share a mutual objective. Prevent a nuclear war that will destroy all civilized life on the planet. After watching this presentation, every rational person must come to deal with the prospects of putting a psycho in command of the launch codes. 
Folks; Donald Trump is not the mad man. The schizoid is a systemic and immoral lunatic, who is ready to drop the beheading blade on all of America. Her similarity with Madame Defarge bleeds over to her decadent boosters, who are willing to sacrifice their family, friends and community for the joy of destroying our planet. 
For all the dissatisfied and frustrated citizens, who understand the colossal stakes of national survival intervene with any fellow acquaintance that has been indoctrinated to the propaganda of Hillaryland . Confront the zombies attitude and appeal to their individual self-interest. Put forth the prospect of not voting for Clinton, even if Trump would not be an option.

The power structure in ready to collapse and the global elites are prepared to start a world war to keep and protect their feudal system of coercion. Those who might survive will be the special and the anointed. The masses will be served up on the plate of expediency and necessity. 
Hillary Clinton has always been part of the gang of criminals, protected by the intelligence community, insider politicians and the legal system of corrupt lawyers and judges. Voting for her is a clear validation of pure mental illness. 
The fact that the discredited FBI is endeavoring to regain their credibility by reopening the criminal investigation into Killary Clinton's attempt to hide her family's pay to play scheme to sell out our country is dramatic. This development should provide ample reason to put any notion of voting for the diva of sleaze on hold. Thanks to the Wikileaks release of the illicit emails from the Clinton cabal, only a fool can vote for her. 
Come to grips with the prospects of knowingly elevating this lifelong criminal to become the commander-and-chief. Genuine national security cannot be scarified to allow a distrustful and compromised agent of foreign interests to become President. 
Killary is dead meat. She could never gain the confidence of the nation and her continued nihilistic conduct and her kleptocrat criminal violations cannot be tolerated or ignored any longer. If you really want to save the planet, you cannot cast your ballot for this known traitor.

‹ › Arnaldo Rodgers is a trained and educated Psychologist. He has worked as a community organizer and activist. South Jersey veterans have miles to go for better care By Arnaldo Rodgers on November 1, 2016 veterans 
BY VINCENT JACKSON 
Phil Cinquina, who served in the Army in the 1940s, makes it a priority to maintain his health by working out several times a week. 
Cinquina, 89, has been more fortunate than other members of his American Legion Post in Weymouth Township. He said he can't understand why veterans with health problems can't get help locally. 
Instead, to visit a VA hospital, local veterans have to travel by bus or van hours away to Pennsylvania, Delaware or northern New Jersey. 
'In Northfield, you have to catch the bus, and it's a two-hour ride to the hospital. They will go on the bus together. Everybody has to wait until everyone on the bus is done (seeing a doctor), and then it comes back,” Cinquina said.

  Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. Lemmings and Republicans – Alan Ned Sabrosky By VNN on November 1, 2016 So why are so many Republican leaders doing all they can do to diminish Trump and give the election to Clinton ? Donald Trump's Triumph Forces GOP Party Leaders to Make a Decision – Loyalty Pledge 
For conservatives and Republicans, a win by Hillary Clinton in November would be a catastrophe — and not just because people like Miley Cyrus and Al Sharpton would not leave the country. Lemmings who vow to leave the U.S. if Trump Wins 
It would mean continued assaults on the 1st and 2nd Amendments, especially the latter. Higher taxes and more welfare. More war — Hillary Clinton's defense secretary-in-waiting, Michelle Flournoy, has openly said as much. And it would mean her appointment of at least one justice to the US Supreme Court, and perhaps as many as four, creating a liberal block of five to seven justices that will put its stamp on the country for a generation or more. Lemmings 
So why are so many Republican leaders doing all they can do to diminish Trump and give the election to Clinton, either attacking him openly or withholding support from him? Sure, Trump's style is often abrasive, and he is a bully, and most importantly to professional politicians, he made fools of the Republican establishment by trashing their best efforts to defeat him. 
But all of that has happened earlier, and the party's leadership have generally rallied around their chosen candidate. So none of the above ought to make so many of the Republican Party's 'leaders” act like lemmings running around in search of a cliff, jeopardizing everything their party has stood for by enhancing Clinton's prospects. 
This type of internal division happened significantly only twice before. In 1860, the Democrats split so badly that the two factions each ran a candidate for president. 
The Republican candidate – Abraham Lincoln – won by default, and the outcome was a bloody civil war and poisoned internal relations. 
In 1964, the Republican establishment largely rejected their candidate – Barry Goldwater. This gave Lyndon Johnson a win, and America? – well, America got a horribly escalated war in Vietnam we eventually lost, and an even worse 'war on poverty” that created a huge welfare class and effectively dismantled the black family. 
These precedents are not exactly classified secrets, but much of the Republican 'leadership” persists in self-destructive behavior. This is because today, there is one unspoken issue that sets Trump apart from Hillary Clinton, and in opposition to all of the other Republican candidates at the start of the primary season — and, oddly enough, aligns him with Bernie Sanders. 
This is that he cannot be counted on to go to war with Iran as soon as possible, which is what Israel wants and what its lobby in the US — AIPAC ( American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the self-described owner of Capitol Hill ) – uses as the litmus test for the legitimacy of a candidate in this election. 
Thus, in obedience to AIPAC, many in the Republican establishment throw their core interests to the wind and in effect serve Hillary Clinton. This was especially evident in the open letter signed by many self-described Republican national security experts declaring Trump unfit for the presidency. 
Left unsaid in it was that most are Jewish; many have dual Israeli citizenship; all put Israel first; all have been architects of one or more of our 'lovely” Middle East wars since 2001; and all want the US to attack Iran, alone or in concert with Israel. Architects of Endless 'Regime Change” wars 
This ought to give some idea of the sort of debacle awaiting us after the November elections. When the smoke clears, unless Hillary Clinton's many scandals surface soon and dramatically, perhaps the Republican Party (or whatever remains of it) will replace the elephant with the lemming as the party symbol. I'm just not sure either deserves that fate.

  Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside By VNN on October 31, 2016 The newly opened FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server marks "a potential Constitutional crisis" for the country. 
Chicago Tribune 
Has America become so numb by the decades of lies and cynicism oozing from Clinton Inc. that it could elect Hillary Clinton as president, even after Friday's FBI announcement that it had reopened an investigation of her emails while secretary of state? 
We'll find out soon enough. 
It's obvious the American political system is breaking down. It's been crumbling for some time now, and the establishment elite know it and they're properly frightened. Donald Trump , the vulgarian at their gates, is a symptom, not a cause. Hillary Clinton and husband Bill are both cause and effect. 
FBI director James Comey 's announcement about the renewed Clinton email investigation is the bombshell in the presidential campaign. That he announced this so close to Election Day should tell every thinking person that what the FBI is looking at is extremely serious. 
This can't be about pervert Anthony Weiner and his reported desire for a teenage girl. But it can be about the laptop of Weiner's wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin , and emails between her and Hillary. It comes after the FBI investigation in which Comey concluded Clinton had lied and been 'reckless” with national secrets, but said he could not recommend prosecution. 
So what should the Democrats do now? 

If ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: 
They would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. 
Democrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. 
Since Oct. 7, WikiLeaks has released 35,000 emails hacked from Clinton campaign boss John Podesta . Now WikiLeaks, no longer a neutral player but an active anti-Clinton agency, plans to release another 15,000 emails. 
What if she is elected? Think of a nation suffering a bad economy and continuing chaos in the Middle East, and now also facing a criminal investigation of a president. Add to that congressional investigations and a public vision of Clinton as a Nixonian figure wandering the halls, wringing her hands. 
The best thing would be for Democrats to ask her to step down now. It would be the most responsible thing to do, if the nation were more important to them than power. And the American news media — fairly or not firmly identified in the public mind as Mrs. Clinton's political action committee — should begin demanding it. 
But what will Hillary do? 
She'll stick and ride this out and turn her anger toward Comey. For Hillary and Bill Clinton, it has always been about power, about the Clinton Restoration and protecting fortunes already made by selling nothing but political influence. 
She'll remind the nation that she's a woman and that Donald Trump said terrible things about women. If there is another notorious Trump video to be leaked, the Clintons should probably leak it now. Then her allies in media can talk about misogyny and sexual politics and the headlines can be all about Trump as the boor he is and Hillary as champion of female victims, which she has never been. 
Remember that Bill Clinton leveraged the 'Year of the Woman.” Then he preyed on women in the White House and Hillary protected him. But the political left — most particularly the women of the left — defended him because he promised to protect abortion rights and their other agendas. 
If you take a step back from tribal politics, you'll see that Mrs. Clinton has clearly disqualified herself from ever coming near classified information again. If she were a young person straight out of grad school hoping to land a government job, Hillary Clinton would be laughed out of Washington with her record. She'd never be hired. 
As secretary of state she kept classified documents on the home-brew server in her basement, which is against the law. She lied about it to the American people. She couldn't remember details dozens of times when questioned by the FBI. Her aides destroyed evidence by BleachBit and hammers. Her husband, Bill, met secretly on an airport tarmac with Attorney General Loretta Lynch for about a half-hour, and all they said they talked about was golf and the grandkids. 
And there was no prosecution of Hillary. 
That isn't merely wrong and unethical. It is poisonous. 
And during this presidential campaign, Americans were confronted with a two-tiered system of federal justice: one for standards for the Clintons and one for the peasants. 
I've always figured that, as secretary of state, Clinton kept her home-brew email server — from which foreign intelligence agencies could hack top secret information — so she could shield the influence peddling that helped make the Clintons several fortunes. 
The Clintons weren't skilled merchants. They weren't traders or manufacturers. The Clintons never produced anything tangible. They had no science, patents or devices to make them millions upon millions of dollars. FBI's Comey acted out of 'obligation' to lawmakers, fear of leak to media 
All they had to sell, really, was influence. And they used our federal government to leverage it. 
If a presidential election is as much about the people as it is about the candidates, then we'll learn plenty about ourselves in the coming days, won't we?

BREAKING ALL THE RULES hosts SARTRE Commentary. BATR.org and BATR.net Only Demented Imbeciles want a Killary Reign of Terror By Sartre on November 1, 2016 
The cross section of Hillary Clinton voters is a mixture of walking dead zombies, power hungry influence peddlers, money cartel thieves and establishment diehards willing to start a global confrontation to postpone an inevitable economic collapse. As for the first category; welfare recipients, government bootlickers and mentally deranged utopians survive in a subsistence existence or in a fantasy illusion. The corruption purveyors simply want to maintain their elitist system of institutional inequality. As for the tribe of international finance, their objective always remains the same. Pick the next stooge who can be controlled. Finally, for globalist who are frantic to continue their New World Order of worldwide oppression, the elevation of Hillary Clinton to the position of the mad hatter to achieve the mutual assured destruction that these Illuminati's masters of the universe require to purge the 'Little People” from the planet. 
Any opposition to this band of desperate and deranged desperados is portrayed as racist, xenophobic and defiant of the 'Politically Correct” secular humanism culture. Here is the fundamental point of the conflict. The abandonment of the cannons of natural and common law has produced a didactic ineptness that thrusts humanity into a technocratic prison of a meaningless existence. Dante's Inferno of basic extinction is the ultimate society that a capitulation to the rigged electoral fraud seeks to achieve. 
The bloody record of Killary Clinton earns her an especially prominent place in hell. Take your choice. She may descend into Level 7 , for 'The violent, the assasins, the tyrants, and the war-mongers lament their pitiless mischiefs in the river, while centaurs armed with bows and arrows shoot those who try to escape their punishment” or Level 8- the Malebolge where 'The magicians, diviners, fortune tellers, and panderers are all here, as are the thieves”. 
Of course this allegory of punishment falls on deaf ears for the Clintonistas . For them this blameless role model for social justice warriors can do no wrong. All the evidence and proof in the world is ignored or dismissed when your patron saint of the occult wears pants suits. 
The reason HRC is better known as Killary has a lot to do with the body count that follows her around. THE CLINTON BODY-COUNT and the 'CLINTON DEATH LIST': 33 SPINE-TINGLING CASES lists several of her enemies that dared defy the queen of mean. Now are these suspicious circumstances of such deaths just another right-wing conspiracy to bring down the Arkancide crime syndicate? 
To an objective investigator, engaging into an in-depth probe might just get one added to this long list. But why would a Clinton supporter care, she is the epitome of the liberated woman and placing her on the throne of feminism is far overdue. Accepting, if not savoring a little reign of terror is a small price to pay as long as the body count does not include your own person. 
During the French Revolution the sanguinary women, known as Tricoteuse , who sat and knitted while attending public guillotine executions have more in common with Robespierre than Marie Antoinette. These devotee libbers identified with the symbol of equality, while their crowned head of elitism disdainfully admonish the peasants: 'Qu'ils mangent de la brioche”. 
Queen Marie Antoinette may not have really said, 'Let them eat cake” but the regnant of the House of Clinton demonstrates throughout her entire life revealed her true sentiments; despise and contempt for the 'Little People”. 
The knitting culture of the zombies cult of progressive authoritarianism is at the center of the public psychosis that follows the dictates of Hillary Clinton. Their identity is so caught up in the myth of collectivism that the very spirit of individual liberty is a necessary causality to join the Clinton demon worship. 
Look to the fictional character of Madame Defarge penned in A Tale of Two Cities for a synopsis of all that is wrong with Killary and her followers. Charles Dickens presents this viewpoint of the quintessential monster. 
'Her problem, it seems, is that Madame Defarge just doesn't know where to draw the line. As far as she's concerned, 'justice” for the fate of her family isn't just that the Marquis gets murdered. Justice should, she thinks, include the 'extermination” of all of the Marquis's family. Given her druthers, Charles, Lucie, and even little Lucie would fall under the sharp blade of La Guillotine. As Madame Defarge exclaims to her husband, 'Tell the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!” (3.12.36). 
'It was nothing to her that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself.” (3.14.33) 
So it comes as no surprise that when 'The meeting between Lucie and Madame Defarge makes this absolutely clear: Lucie falls on her knees, begging for mercy on behalf of her child. Madame Defarge stares at her coldly. She doesn't even stop knitting.” 
This example of the dark side of human nature is particularly relevant and applicable when analyzing the gender iniquity of the wicked witch. For femininity enablement to champion such abuse from a coldhearted degenerate is the biggest disappointment of this election cycle. Society should never condone or provide consent for anyone, male or female; who is such a habitual sociopath. 
The influence hucksters do not pretend to be altruistic . They would support Lucifer if they thought they would gain the riches of this world. As for the money changers, they are already archfiends in the Synagogue of Satan. Lastly, the globalist's warmongers covet the mass eradication of billions to satisfy their lust for world transcendence. 
These three factions are the true irredeemables. The masses of the walking dead need to politically repent and seek civic redemption. This objective is not possible by voting for Hillary Clinton. 
If you do nothing else before the November 8, 2016 election watch the video, A Vote For Hillary is a Vote For World War 3 . No matter your ideological propensities, we all share a mutual objective. Prevent a nuclear war that will destroy all civilized life on the planet. After watching this presentation, every rational person must come to deal with the prospects of putting a psycho in command of the launch codes. 
Folks; Donald Trump is not the mad man. The schizoid is a systemic and immoral lunatic, who is ready to drop the beheading blade on all of America. Her similarity with Madame Defarge bleeds over to her decadent boosters, who are willing to sacrifice their family, friends and community for the joy of destroying our planet. 
For all the dissatisfied and frustrated citizens, who understand the colossal stakes of national survival intervene with any fellow acquaintance that has been indoctrinated to the propaganda of Hillaryland . Confront the zombies attitude and appeal to their individual self-interest. Put forth the prospect of not voting for Clinton, even if Trump would not be an option. 
Citizens will not be the only people voting. Non eligible people are being ushered into a ballot booth with predisposed programming to put Killary into the oval office. The establishment is revealing their real tyranny for any person, who is still alive and has the ability to assess the actual nature of this election. 
The power structure in ready to collapse and the global elites are prepared to start a world war to keep and protect their feudal system of coercion. Those who might survive will be the special and the anointed. The masses will be served up on the plate of expediency and necessity. 
Hillary Clinton has always been part of the gang of criminals, protected by the intelligence community, insider politicians and the legal system of corrupt lawyers and judges. Voting for her is a clear validation of pure mental illness. 
The fact that the discredited FBI is endeavoring to regain their credibility by reopening the criminal investigation into Killary Clinton's attempt to hide her family's pay to play scheme to sell out our country is dramatic. This development should provide ample reason to put any notion of voting for the diva of sleaze on hold.

Roughly 7,400 veterans who use the Kernersville, Charlotte and Salisbury Veterans Affairs health care and medical centers are waiting on travel reimbursements, some of which were supposed to have been processed back in July. 
UPDATE: As of November 1st, the Salisbury VA offices now say they have begun processing travel vouchers for October. The vouchers will be processed in sequential date order. 
The backlog is affecting veterans like Lee, who is reluctant to use his full name because he fears there might be backlash against him for speaking out about the delays. 
'I don't know what kind of adverse action might be taken against me,” the Air Force veteran said. '[The VA employees] have a good job. They're not rushing. They don't really care.”

Trump: At the Third debate: Now we can talk about Putin. I don't know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good. He has no respect for her (Hillary). He has no respect for our president. 
She (Hillary) doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.﻿

By Paul Craig Roberts on October 18, 2016 "...it would be extremely dangerous to have in the White House a person susceptible to uncontrollable rage" HILLARY MELTDOWN! THROW A GLASS OF WATER AT THE FACE OF HER ASSISTANT DURING RAGE AT MATT LAUER'S UNAPPROVED EMAIL QUESTION DURING NBC PRESIDENTIAL FORUM 
by Paul Craig Roberts 
Until I viewed the video in the URL below, I had concluded from my time spent with Republicans that the Republican Party was more corrupt than the Democratic Party. But after watching this 16 minute video report, which seems too much to be faked, the Democratic political establishment —not necessarily the Americans who vote Democrat—seem to be corrupt beyond the meaning of the word. Make up your own mind. 
'In this explosive new video from Project Veritas Action — a Democratic dirty tricks operative unwittingly provides a dark money trail to the DNC and Clinton campaign. The video documents violence at Trump rallies that is traced to the Clinton campaign and the DNC through a process called birddogging.” 
Published on Oct 17, 2016 Matt Lauer , NBC 
This second video report — purports to be based on reports by the NBC TV crew that filmed Hillary's September 7 interview by Matt Lauer. 
Lauer departed from the pre-agreed script, and the result was a meltdown by Hillary following the interview. 
This 8 minute report confirms Secret Service agent Gary Byrne's account of Hillary's explosive, uncontrollable temper in his book Crisis of Character. 
Ex-Secret Service Agent: 'People Need to Know The Real Hillary Clinton And How Dangerous She Is” 
Former Secret Service officer Gary Byrne, author of the new book Crisis of Character , which examines Hillary Clinton's conduct under his watch, appeared on FOX News Channel's Hannity. 
If these reports are true, at this time of heightened tensions between Washington and the two other major nuclear powers, it would be extremely dangerous to have in the White House a person susceptible to uncontrollable rage, especially a person who would be staffed with neoconservative warmongers. Architects of 'Regime Change” wars 
A vote for Hillary could be a vote for nuclear war and the end of life on earth.

By Paul Craig Roberts on November 3, 2016 Hillary's crimes might cost her the election, but she won't go to jail. 
by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts The Federal Bureau of Investigation is reviewing another slew of emails related to Hillary Clinton's private server. 
Aren't you surprised that Hillary and the presstitutes haven't blamed Putin for FBI director Comey's reopening of the Hillary email case? But the presstitutes have done the next best thing for Hillary. They have made Comey the issue, not Hillary. 
According to US Senator Harry Reid and the presstitutes, we don't need to worry about Hillary's crimes. After all, she is only a political woman feathering her nest, just as political men have done for ages. Why all this misogynist talk about Hillary? 
The presstitutes' cry is that Comey's alleged crime is far more important. This woman-hating Republican violated the Hatch Act by telling Congress that the investigation he said was closed is now reopened. A very strange interpretation of the Hatch Act. During an election it is OK to announce that a candidate for president is cleared but it is not OK to say that a candidate is under investigation. 
In July 2016 Comey violated the Hatch Act when he, on orders from the corrupt Obama Attorney General, announced Hillary clean. In so doing, Comey used the prestige of federal clearance of Hillary's violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls. 
Actually, Hillary's standing in the polls is based on the pollsters over-weighting Hillary supporters in the polls. It is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions. If you look at the crowds attending the two candidate's public appearances, it is clear that the American people prefer Donald Trump, who is opposed to war with Russia and China. War with nuclear powers is the big issue of the election. 
Hillary's problem has the ruling American Oligarchy, for which Hillary is the total servant, concerned. 
What are they going to do about Trump if he wins? Will his fate be the same as John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, George Wallace? Time will tell. Or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the Oligarchy got rid of Dominique Strauss-Kahn? Dominique Strauss Kahn indicted by Grand Jury and out on six million dollar bailout, but could he have been set up? 
All of the American and Western feminists, progressives, and left-wing remnant fell for the obvious frame-up of Strauss-Kahn. After Strauss-Kahn was blocked from the presidency of France and resigned as Director of the IMF, the New York authorities had to drop all charges against Strauss-Kahn. But Washington succeeded in removing Strauss-Kahn as a challenge to its French vassal, Sarkozy. 
This is how the American Oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests. The corrupt self-serving Oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media, the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities, and, of course, through the presstitutes, Americans' minds. 
The Oligarchs are now hard-pressed to rescue Hillary as US president, so let's see if the Oligarchs can once again deceive the American people. 
While we wait, let's concern ourselves with another important issue. The Clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the 20th century allowed a small handful of mega-corporations to consolidate the US media in a few hands. This vast increase in the power of the Oligarchy was accomplished despite US anti-trust law. The media mergers destroyed the American tradition of a dispersed and independent media. 
But really, what does federal law mean to the One Percent. Nothing whatsoever. The One Percent's power makes them immune to law. Hillary's crimes might cost her the election, but she won't go to jail. 
Not content with 90% control of the US media, the Oligarchy wants more concentration and more control. Looks like they will be getting it, thanks to the corrupt US government. The Federal Trade Commission is supposed to enforce US anti-trust law. Instead, the federal agency routinely violates US anti-trust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests. 
Because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law, we now have 'banks too big to fail,” unregulated Internet monopoly, and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media. 
Not so long ago there was a field of economics known as anti-trust. Ph.D. candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power. I assume that this field of economics, like the America of my youth, no longer exists. 
In the article below, Rahul Manchanda, explains that 'yet again another huge media conglomerate is being swallowed and acquired by another huge media conglomerate, to create another gargantuan media outlet, in another consolidation of the enormous power, money, wealth, intimidation, conspiracy and control” that eviscerates the US Constitution and the First Amendment.

UFC GYM® Celebrates 'Veterans Day” with Complimentary Military Access ‹ › Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. Forget the FBI cache; the Podesta emails show how America is run By VNN on November 3, 2016 They are all engaged in promoting one another's careers, constantly. For them the door revolves. The friends all succeed. They break every boundary. White House press secretary Jay Carney, left, and White House senior counselor John Podesta, right, laugh during the daily news briefing at the White House in Washington Monday, May 5, 2014.

WikiLeaks' dump of messages to and from Clinton's campaign chief offer an unprecedented view into the workings of the elite, and how it looks after itself 
The Guardian T he emails currently roiling the US presidential campaign are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome Anthony Weiner, but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate Washington today, the emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by WikiLeaks from the hacked account of Hillary Clinton's campaign chair John Podesta. The U.S. Justice Department official Peter Kadzik in charge of of the probe into Hillary Clinton's and Huma Abedin's emails sent Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta a 'heads up' about a congressional hearing into her secret server last year. Wikileaks reveals Podesta responded by looping senior campaign staff into the conversation and said the hearing would provide 'additional chances for mischief.' 
They are last week's scandal in a year running over with scandals, but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal: they are a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers. 
The class to which I refer is not rising in angry protest; they are by and large pretty satisfied, pretty contented. Nobody takes road trips to exotic West Virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live; on the contrary, they are the ones for whom such stories are written. This bunch doesn't have to make do with a comb-over TV mountebank for a leader; for this class, the choices are always pretty good, and this year they happen to be excellent. Is Huma Abedin Hillary Clinton's Secret Weapon Or Her Next Big Problem? 
They are the comfortable and well-educated mainstay of our modern Democratic party. They are also the grandees of our national media; the architects of our software; the designers of our streets; the high officials of our banking system; the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or fine-tune the Middle East with precision droning. They are, they think, not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones, the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves. 
Let us turn the magnifying glass on them for a change, by sorting through the hacked personal emails of John Podesta, who has been a Washington power broker for decades. I admit that I feel uncomfortable digging through this hoard; stealing someone's email is a crime, after all, and it is outrageous that people's personal information has been exposed, since WikiLeaks doesn't seem to have redacted the emails in any way. There is also the issue of authenticity to contend with: we don't know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from John Podesta. The supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their authenticity, and though they seem to be real, there is a small possibility they aren't. 
With all that taken into consideration, I think the WikiLeaks releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the American status hierarchy in all its righteousness and majesty. Bill Clinton now leads a sprawling philanthropic empire like no other. And yet it's hard to shake the sense that it's not all about saving the world. 
The dramatis personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of work: financial innovators. High-achieving colleagues attempting to get jobs for their high-achieving children. Foundation executives doing fine and noble things. Prizes, of course, and high academic achievement. 
Certain industries loom large and virtuous here. Hillary's ingratiating speeches to Wall Street are well known of course, but what is remarkable is that, in the party of Jackson and Bryan and Roosevelt, smiling financiers now seem to stand on every corner, constantly proffering advice about this and that. Citigroup bank chose Obama's 2008 cabinet – WikiLeaks 
In one now-famous email chain, for example, the reader can watch current US trade representative Michael Froman, writing from a Citibank email address in 2008, appear to name President Obama's cabinet even before the great hope-and-change election was decided (incidentally, an important clue to understanding why that greatest of zombie banks was never put out of its misery). 
The far-sighted innovators of Silicon Valley are also here in force, interacting all the time with the leaders of the party of the people. We watch as Podesta appears to email Sheryl Sandberg. He makes plans to visit Mark Zuckerberg (who, according to one missive, wants to 'learn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social action”). Podesta exchanges emails with an entrepreneur about an ugly race now unfolding for Silicon Valley's seat in Congress; this man, in turn, appears to forward to Podesta the remarks of yet another Silicon Valley grandee, who complains that one of the Democratic combatants in that fight was criticizing billionaires who give to Democrats. Specifically, the miscreant Dem in question was said to be: 
'… spinning (and attacking) donors who have supported Democrats. John Arnold and Marc Leder have both given to Cory Booker, Joe Kennedy, and others. He is also attacking every billionaire that donates to [Congressional candidate] Ro [Khanna], many whom support other Democrats as well.” 
(Hilariously, in another email chain , the Clinton team appears to scheme to 'hit” Bernie Sanders for attending 'DSCC retreats on Martha's Vineyard with lobbyists”.) 
Then there is the apparent nepotism, the dozens if not hundreds of mundane emails in which petitioners for this or that plum Washington job or high-profile academic appointment politely appeal to Podesta – the ward-heeler of the meritocratic elite – for a solicitous word whispered in the ear of a powerful crony. 
Scandal at Clinton Inc. 
This genre of Podesta email, in which people try to arrange jobs for themselves or their kids, points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else. Of course Hillary Clinton staffed her state department with investment bankers and then did speaking engagements for investment banks as soon as she was done at the state department. 
Of course she appears to think that any kind of bank reform should 'come from the industry itself”. And of course no elite bankers were ever prosecuted by the Obama administration. 
Read these emails and you understand, with a start, that the people at the top tier of American life all know each other. They are all engaged in promoting one another's careers, constantly. Architects of 'Regime Change” Wars 
Everything blurs into everything else in this world. The state department, the banks, Silicon Valley, the nonprofits, the ' Global CEO Advisory Firm ” that appears to have solicited donations for the Clinton Foundation. Executives here go from foundation to government to thinktank to startup. There are honors. Venture capital. Foundation grants. Endowed chairs. Advanced degrees. 
For them the door revolves. The friends all succeed. They break every boundary. 
But the One Big Boundary remains. Yes, it's all supposed to be a meritocracy. But if you aren't part of this happy, prosperous in-group – if you don't have John Podesta's email address – you're out.

BY NICHOLAS CONFESSORE The roster of retired military officers endorsing Hillary Clinton in September glittered with decoration and rank. One former general led the American surge in Anbar, one of the most violent provinces in Iraq. Another commanded American-led allied forces battling the Taliban in Afghanistan. Yet another trained the first Iraqis to combat Islamic insurgents in their own country. But as Election Day approaches, many veterans are instead turning to Donald J. Trump, a businessman who avoided the Vietnam draft and has boasted of gathering foreign policy wisdom by watching television shows. Even as other voters abandon Mr. Trump, veterans remain among his most loyal supporters, an unlikely connection forged by the widening gulf they feel from other Americans.

By MaryAlice Parks 
From George Washington to John McCain, the United States has a long history of veterans running for office. 
This year appears to be no exception with the halls of Capitol Hill likely to be filled with even more than the 100 former military members already there, according to Congressional Quarterly. 
Here's a look at some of the candidates across the country who are veterans and how they've used their military experience to stand out: 
Using his military record to portray himself as a Washington outsider, Kander, a Democrat and former Army National Guard captain, has managed to put his race on the national radar. He has attracted outside spending from both sides of the aisle as Democrats look to regain control of the upper chamber.

by Israel Shamir 
I envy you, American citizens. I do not care about your military might, nor for your supreme currency, the US dollar. I envy your chance to deal on 11/8 a decisive blow to the rule of the Masters of Discourse. 
Though the Masters control the entirety of world media, and they decide what people may think and say from Canada to Hong Kong, only you, American citizens, can defeat them. This is a great chance, a unique opportunity not to be missed. 
The Masters of Discourse can be defeated. They are not stronger than any ruler of past. Trump has a great quality making him fit for the task: he is impervious to labels and libels. He had been called everything in the book: anti-Semite, racist, women hater, you name it. And he still survived that flak. Such people are very rare. 
We know he is against the Masters because every newspaper is against him. I never saw a similar onslaught but once, in Russia in 1996. Then President Yeltsin, an old drunkard who had brought Russia to collapse, had to run for his second term. His popularity was next to zero. Two per cent of Russians intended to vote for him. And then the oligarchs turned on their propaganda machine. Yeltsin's competitor Gennady Zyuganov, a mild church-going post-communist, had been presented like a Hitler of his days. All the Russian media of the day belonged to oligarchs, and all of it participated in the onslaught. Zyuganov surrendered. 
Perhaps he won the election, but he congratulated Yeltsin with his victory. It was said that he was threatened with assassination unless… Others say he was bribed. I do not exclude both explanations, but for sure the might of united media can crush a timid man. 
In the days of the Jewish Temple, there was a Magrepha, a wind instrument able to produce diverse and frightening sounds. There is no agreement among the scholars about what sort of thing it was. Whenever it sounded, people were scared. 
The media of our days is a new Magrepha. If all of its outputs are united, they produce a terrible roar. A Magrepha, the organ of the ancient Hebrews in the synagogue. 
Yes, the onslaught of the media upon Trump has been exceedingly unfair, but he survived it. What is even more important, you survived it, it does not matter what the polls say: they say what the newspapers tell them to say. Even people answer the polls according to the media prognoses: they are shy of saying they would vote for a man who … But at the moment of actual vote, they do what they know is right for them. Not for transgenders, not for Muslim brokers, not even for single mothers, but for themselves. 
You have a very good chance to win, and to defeat the witch and her supporters. We learned that the British people voted for Brexit, though all the media said that proposal had no chance. But we also learned from Brexit, that nothing is over until it is over. The Masters of Discourse will try every trick to steal the elections, and only their fear of armed rising may finally force them to acknowledge their inevitable defeat. We know that in 2015, when Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, was afraid of losing the elections, he revealed that the American intelligence has some superior software which allows them to falsify the elections. Perhaps, but he won despite this magical software, despite Obama's wrath. Even in Israel, that favorite son of the Masters, the Masters are hated. The New York Times is always speaking good about Israel, but still Israelis do not like the newspaper. Nobody likes them, nobody likes an old aunt who tries to tell us what we can say and what we can't. If Netanyahu could win, Trump can win twice. KEY STATES TILTING TOWARD TRUMP AFTER FBI'S OCTOBER SURPRISE 
After the first debate of Trump and Clinton, people said: She won! But we shall vote for him. This was a very encouraging sign. Indeed every woman worth its salt would win an argument with her husband or son-in-law, let alone a pretender. That is the way we are made. 
The story of sirens enforces the belief that if you listen to a woman, she will bewitch you. Sirens actually ate the bewitched sailors; our womenfolk do not go to such extremes, but they can cause us a lot of trouble. 
Trump seems to be almost pure of heart and deed, as even the extremely prejudiced media could not find anything really incriminating about him but bragging about having his way with women. 
I shall not recount so many proven accusations against Hillary. All of that can be found in the emails revealed by Julian Assange and his great Wikileaks team. The media kept mum about it, but the secrets can't be kept forever. 
There are many practical things Donald Trump will be able to fix. He can return industries home, he can return American GIs home from four ends of the world, he can improve life for a lot of working men and women. But he surely will set all of us free from the annoying bondage of the Masters. Just for that reason, go and vote, for yourself and for millions of us who aren't entitled to.

By Paul Craig Roberts on November 3, 2016 The Oligarchs are now hard-pressed to rescue Hillary as US president, so let's see if the Oligarchs can once again deceive the American people. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is reviewing another slew of emails pertinent to Hillary Clinton's private server investigation. 
by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts 
Aren't you surprised that Hillary and the presstitutes haven't blamed Putin for FBI director Comey's reopening of the Hillary email case? But the presstitutes have done the next best thing for Hillary. They have made Comey the issue, not Hillary. 
According to US Senator Harry Reid and the presstitutes, we don't need to worry about Hillary's crimes. After all, she is only a political woman feathering her nest, just as political men have done for ages. Why all this misogynist talk about Hillary? 
The presstitutes' cry is that Comey's alleged crime is far more important. This woman-hating Republican violated the Hatch Act by telling Congress that the investigation he said was closed is now reopened. 
A very strange interpretation of the Hatch Act. During an election it is OK to announce that a candidate for president is cleared but it is not OK to say that a candidate is under investigation. 
In July 2016 Comey violated the Hatch Act when he, on orders from the corrupt Obama Attorney General, announced Hillary clean. In so doing, Comey used the prestige of federal clearance of Hillary's violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls. Dare We Call It Oligarchy? Gary Hart is a former United States senator 
Actually, Hillary's standing in the polls is based on the pollsters over-weighting Hillary supporters in the polls. It is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions. If you look at the crowds attending the two candidate's public appearances, it is clear that the American people prefer Donald Trump, who is opposed to war with Russia and China. War with nuclear powers is the big issue of the election. 
Hillary's problem has the ruling American Oligarchy, for which Hillary is the total servant, concerned. 
What are they going to do about Trump if he wins? Will his fate be the same as John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, George Wallace? Time will tell. Or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the Oligarchy got rid of Dominique Strauss-Kahn? Dominique Strauss Kahn indicted by Grand Jury and out on six million dollar bailout, but could he have been set up? 
All of the American and Western feminists, progressives, and left-wing remnant fell for the obvious frame-up of Strauss-Kahn. After Strauss-Kahn was blocked from the presidency of France and resigned as Director of the IMF, the New York authorities had to drop all charges against Strauss-Kahn. But Washington succeeded in removing Strauss-Kahn as a challenge to its French vassal, Sarkozy. 
This is how the American Oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests. The corrupt self-serving Oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media, the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities, and, of course, through the presstitutes, Americans' minds. 
The Oligarchs are now hard-pressed to rescue Hillary as US president, so let's see if the Oligarchs can once again deceive the American people. 
While we wait, let's concern ourselves with another important issue. The Clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the 20th century allowed a small handful of mega-corporations to consolidate the US media in a few hands. This vast increase in the power of the Oligarchy was accomplished despite US anti-trust law. The media mergers destroyed the American tradition of a dispersed and independent media. 
But really, what does federal law mean to the One Percent. Nothing whatsoever. The One Percent's power makes them immune to law. Hillary's crimes might cost her the election, but she won't go to jail. 
Not content with 90% control of the US media, the Oligarchy wants more concentration and more control. Looks like they will be getting it, thanks to the corrupt US government. The Federal Trade Commission is supposed to enforce US anti-trust law. Instead, the federal agency routinely violates US anti-trust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests. 
Because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law, we now have 'banks too big to fail,” unregulated Internet monopoly, and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media. 
Not so long ago there was a field of economics known as anti-trust. Ph.D. candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power. I assume that this field of economics, like the America of my youth, no longer exists. 
In the article below, Rahul Manchanda, explains that 'yet again another huge media conglomerate is being swallowed and acquired by another huge media conglomerate, to create another gargantuan media outlet, in another consolidation of the enormous power, money, wealth, intimidation, conspiracy and control” that eviscerates the US Constitution and the First Amendment.

by Israel Shamir 
I envy you, American citizens. I do not care about your military might, nor for your supreme currency, the US dollar. I envy your chance to deal on 11/8 a decisive blow to the rule of the Masters of Discourse. 
Though the Masters control the entirety of world media, and they decide what people may think and say from Canada to Hong Kong, only you, American citizens, can defeat them. This is a great chance, a unique opportunity not to be missed. 
The Masters of Discourse can be defeated. They are not stronger than any ruler of past. Trump has a great quality making him fit for the task: he is impervious to labels and libels. He had been called everything in the book: anti-Semite, racist, women hater, you name it. And he still survived that flak. Such people are very rare. 
We know he is against the Masters because every newspaper is against him. I never saw a similar onslaught but once, in Russia in 1996. Then President Yeltsin, an old drunkard who had brought Russia to collapse, had to run for his second term. His popularity was next to zero. Two per cent of Russians intended to vote for him. And then the oligarchs turned on their propaganda machine. Yeltsin's competitor Gennady Zyuganov, a mild church-going post-communist, had been presented like a Hitler of his days. All the Russian media of the day belonged to oligarchs, and all of it participated in the onslaught. Zyuganov surrendered. 
Perhaps he won the election, but he congratulated Yeltsin with his victory. It was said that he was threatened with assassination unless… Others say he was bribed. I do not exclude both explanations, but for sure the might of united media can crush a timid man. 
In the days of the Jewish Temple, there was a Magrepha, a wind instrument able to produce diverse and frightening sounds. There is no agreement among the scholars about what sort of thing it was. Whenever it sounded, people were scared. 
The media of our days is a new Magrepha. If all of its outputs are united, they produce a terrible roar. A Magrepha, the organ of the ancient Hebrews in the synagogue. 
Yes, the onslaught of the media upon Trump has been exceedingly unfair, but he survived it. 
What is even more important, you survived it, it does not matter what the polls say: they say what the newspapers tell them to say. Even people answer the polls according to the media prognoses: they are shy of saying they would vote for a man who … But at the moment of actual vote, they do what they know is right for them. Not for transgenders, not for Muslim brokers, not even for single mothers, but for themselves. 
You have a very good chance to win, and to defeat the witch and her supporters. We learned that the British people voted for Brexit, though all the media said that proposal had no chance. But we also learned from Brexit, that nothing is over until it is over. The Masters of Discourse will try every trick to steal the elections, and only their fear of armed rising may finally force them to acknowledge their inevitable defeat.

The New York Times is always speaking good about Israel, but still Israelis do not like the newspaper. Nobody likes them, nobody likes an old aunt who tries to tell us what we can say and what we can't. If Netanyahu could win, Trump can win twice.

By Tessa Berenson 
Speaking in front of decorated veterans at a foreign-policy focused rally, Trump said members of the military are 'so much braver” than he is. 
'They're so much braver than me. I wouldn't have done what they did,” Trump said, going off-script in a foreign-policy focused address Thursday evening in Selma, NC. 'I'm brave in other ways. I'm financially brave.” 
The Republican nominee also argued that the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State should make the military wary of promoting her to Commander-in-Chief.

  Keep your thanks, what veterans really need are good jobs   Jobs By Chris Tomlinson 
Skip the 'thank you for your service.” Let's talk about what veterans really need. 
Veterans Day is Friday, and strangers who learn that I served seven years on active duty in the U.S. Army will inevitably thank me for my service. While some people believe that veterans deserve lifelong gratitude for their role protecting our country, more than a few of us find it annoying; an empty platitude that civilians use to absolve themselves from asking what exactly we sacrificed, or what we truly need now. 
What post-9/11 veterans need are good jobs, with good benefits. They need employers who don't thoughtlessly cut-and-paste job prerequisites that favor someone who spent four years partying at a state university over a vet who was waking up at 6 a.m. and wearing a uniform during 60-hour workweeks, except for when they were in combat.

By Michael J.R. Schindler on November 5, 2016 Proven, No-Cost IT Training for Veterans 
Transitioning from active duty military back into the civilian sector often presents a number of new challenges – one being how to reposition ones' skills, abilities, and leadership training into a well-paying civilian job. 
While the majority of veterans eventually land on their feet, close to 50 percent live through or experience unemployment after separation. One program, SAP National Security Services (SAP NS2), under the leadership of retired U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Joseph Kernan and SAP NS2 CEO Mark Testoni , is set on closing that gap and doing so with great success. 
NS2 Serves helps veterans by providing valuable IT training and employment assistance, at no cost to the veterans and has pledged to train & place 400 veterans in new careers by 2021. 
To date more than 100 veterans have completed the training and been placed in high-tech careers. 
Those who qualify and are selected to take part in the 3 month in-house program will find that their travel, room and board are covered, leaving the GI Bill dollars for college courses. In addition, a monthly stipend is provided during the training program as well as mid-term bonuses for completion of requirements. 
The training courses in SAP solutions are geared for U.S. national security missions, leading to 'Certified SAP Associate” status, a credential that is valuable in many career paths in the U.S. and worldwide. 
The Certified Consultants who emerge from the NS2 Serves Training Program will be qualified for several kinds of career opportunities: Data Warehouse Administrator •Data Modeler •Data Architect •Data Warehouse Architect Data Extraction Consultant •Business Intelligence Platform Administrator 
In order to be considered for the program, one needs to meet the following qualifications: Honorably discharged U.S. military veterans, including disabled veterans Veterans must be within (3) three years of their date of separation A minimum of a high school diploma or GED, and relevant technology experience Gold Star Spouses who meet the same education and experience requirements listed above 
Upon graduation, placement assistance is provided to work in the U.S. national security field. And as mentioned earlier, every participant to date has been placed in careers with starting salaries around $60k. 
Bottom line: Today's veterans and their families have had some of the best training in the world while on active duty. The NS2 Serves Training Program is one program that recognizes that with just a bit of additional training, America's Greatest Asset can be repurposed to still help with our national security.

Speaking in front of decorated veterans at a foreign-policy focused rally, Trump said members of the military are 'so much braver” than he is. 
'They're so much braver than me. I wouldn't have done what they did,” Trump said, going off-script in a foreign-policy focused address Thursday evening in Selma, NC. 'I'm brave in other ways. I'm financially brave.” 
The Republican nominee also argued that the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State should make the military wary of promoting her to Commander-in-Chief.

There are disturbing signs that a digital 9/11 terror attack is being readied for election day in the US to ensure that Donald Trump does not win. 
Such an attack – involving widespread internet and power outage – would have nothing to do with Russia or any other foreign state. It would be furnished by agencies of the US Deep State in a classic 'false flag” covert manner. But the resulting chaos and 'assault on American democracy” will be conveniently blamed on Russia. 
That presents a double benefit. Russia would be further demonized as a foreign aggressor 'justifying” even harsher counter measures by America and its European allies against Moscow. 
Secondly, a digital attack on America's presidential election day this week, would allow the Washington establishment to pronounce the result invalidate due to 'Russian cyber subversion”. That option stands to be invoked if the ballot results showed Republican candidate Donald Trump as the imminent victor. 
Democrat rival Hillary Clinton is the clear choice for the White House among the Washington establishment. She has the backing of Wall Street finance capital, the corporate media, the military-industrial complex and the Deep State agencies of the Pentagon and CIA. The fix has been in for months to get her elected by the powers-that-be owing to her well-groomed obedience to American imperialist interests. 
The billionaire property magnate Trump is too much of a maverick to be entrusted with the White House, as far as the American ruling elite are concerned. The trouble is, however, that despite the massive campaign to discredit Trump his poll support remains stubbornly close to Clinton's. 
The latter has been tainted with too many scandals involving allegations of sleazy dealings with Wall Street, so-called pay-for-play favors while she was former Secretary of State, and her penchant for inciting overseas wars for regime change using jihadist terrorist foot-soldiers. 
As one headline from McClatchy News only days ago put it: 'Majority of voters think Clinton acted illegally, new poll finds”. 
Trump is right. The US presidential election is 'rigged”. Despite handwringing condemnations by pundits, it seems obvious that the system is heavily stacked against any candidate who does not conform with the interests of the establishment. The massive media-orchestrated campaign against Trump is testimony to that. 
But such is popular disgust with Clinton, her sleaze-ball husband Bill and the Washington establishment that her victory is far from certain. Indeed in the last week before voting this Tuesday various polls are showing a neck-and-neck race with even some indicators putting the Republican narrowly ahead. 
Over the weekend, the Washington Post, which has been one of the main media outlets panning Trump on a daily basis, reported this: 'The electoral map is definitely moving in Trump's direction”. 
This is where a possible Deep State contingency plan is being readied to scupper a shock win by Trump. 
In recent days, American media are reporting a virtual state of emergency by the US government and its security agencies to thwart what they claim are Russian efforts to incite 'election day cyber mayhem”. 
In one 'exclusive” report by the NBC network on November 3, it was claimed that: 'The US government believes hackers from Russia or elsewhere may try to undermine next week's presidential election and is mounting an unprecedented effort to counter their cyber meddling.” 
On November 4, the Washington Post reported : 'Intelligence officials warn of Russian mischief in election and beyond.” 
Apparently, the emergency security response is being coordinated by the White House, the Department of Homeland Security, the CIA, the National Security Agency and other elements of the Defense Department, according to NBC. 
These claims of Russian state hackers interfering in the US political system are not new. Last month, the Obama administration officially accused Moscow of this alleged malfeasance. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has lambasted American claims that his country is seeking to disrupt the presidential elections as 'hysterical nonsense”, aimed at distracting the electorate from far more deep-rooted internal problems. 
The Obama administration and its state security agencies have not provided one iota of evidence to support their allegations against Russia. Nevertheless the repeated charges have a tendency to stick. Julian Assange, Wikileaks founder. 
The Clinton campaign has for months been accusing Trump of being a 'pro-Russian stooge”. Her campaign has also claimed that Russian hackers have colluded with the whistleblower organization Wikileaks to release thousands of private emails damaging Clinton with the intention of swaying the election in favor of Trump. 
Wikileaks' director Julian Assange and the Russian government have both rejected any suggestion that they are somehow collaborating, or that they are working to get Trump elected. 
But on the eve of the election, the US authorities are recklessly pushing hysteria that Russia is trying to subvert American democracy. Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014 is quoted as saying: 'The Russians are in an offensive mode and the US is working on strategies to respond to that, and at the highest levels.” 
NBC cites a senior Obama administration official as saying that the Russians 'want to sow as much confusion as possible and undermine our process”. 
Ominously, the news outlet adds that 'steps are being taken to prepare for worst-case scenarios, including a cyber-attack that shuts down part of the power grid or the internet.” 
Nearly two weeks ago, on October 21-22, the US was hit with a widespread internet outage.The actors behind the 'distributed denial of service” were not identified, but the disruption was nationwide and it temporarily disabled many popular consumer services. One former official at the US Department of Homeland Security described the event as having 'all the signs of what would be considered a drill”. Could that cyber-attack have been the work of US Deep State agencies as a dress rehearsal for an even bigger outage planned for November 8 – election day? 
The Washington establishment wants Clinton over Trump. She's the marionette of choice for their strategic interests, including a more hostile foreign policy towards Russia in Syria, Ukraine and elsewhere. 
But Trump might just snatch an election day victory from the jaws of defeat. George Soros-NGO manipulator 
In which case, the shadowy forces that really rule America will trigger a 'digital 9/11”. It's not difficult to imagine the chaos and mayhem from internet blackout, power, transport, banking and communications paralysis – even for just a temporary period of a few hours. 
Months of fingering Russia as a destabilizing foreign enemy intent on interfering in US democracy to get 'Comrade Trump” into the White House would then serve as a self-fulfilling prophecy. In that event, the US authorities could plausibly move to declare the election of Donald J Trump null and void. 
In fact the scenario could be contrived to a far more serious level than merely suspending the election result. The US authorities could easily feign that a state of emergency is necessary in order to 'defend national security”. 
That contingency catapults beyond 'rigged politics”. It is a green light for a coup d'état by the Deep State forces who found that they could not win through the 'normal” rigging methods.

  Disgraced Hedge Fund Manager Focuses on Aiding   
BY PAUL SULLIVAN Sitting at the circular table in his office, near an elliptical machine, treadmill and massage table, Steven A. Cohen struggled to find words to describe what motivates his new philanthropic effort. 'You know what I think it is, I was looking for something unique, special, something that I could own,” said Mr. Cohen, the billionaire investor, in an interview at his family office, Point72 Asset Management. It is in the same building as his former hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors, which in 2013 paid $1.8 billion in fines to federal prosecutors and securities regulators. 'I wanted to do something big,” he added. 'I wanted to do something that was all mine.” That something is a two-pronged initiative to help veterans who return from combat with post-traumatic stress or traumatic brain injuries and a separate nonprofit organization to do research into diagnostic tools and treatments for those conditions.

  Maine Gets High Marks for Supporting   
By A.J. Higgins 
A New York personal finance technology company is giving Maine high marks for its efforts to encourage veterans to re-enter the work force and take advantage of veterans programs. 
Asees Singh, of SmartAssets, says that Maine ranks sixth in the country when it comes to several key programs. 
'When veterans come back from serving, the process to adjusting to civilian life can be really difficult for them,” Singh says. 'A survey from Pew Research Center found that 27 percent of veterans had a difficult time re-acclimating to civilian life.” 
SmartAssets' survey concluded that Maine should be proud of the fact that 10.5 percent of all private businesses in the state are owned by veterans.

By Liz Zabel 
Millions of U.S. military servicemen and women have returned to civilian life after serving in the armed forces, and while serving in the military is challenging, many returning veterans find reintegrating even more difficult. 
In fact, according to research published in the Journal of Psychiatric Services, rates of depression and other mental disorders are high among services members within their first year returning from deployments. 
It's not just a change of scenery, after all. Returning also means a change in job duties or a new career, living arrangements, lifestyle and more. 
'When you go into the military, you are stripped down mentally, so the person you were before the military is no longer,” said Laura Boddicker, a Navy veteran originally from Tennessee now living in Newhall.

BY Larry Mcshane 
Two years after serving two tours in Iraq, Army veteran Dustin Shryock started feeling something was wrong — and he didn't know how to make it right. 
'Anxiety attacks that would pop up for no reason,” he recalls of the problems that surfaced out of the blue in 2010. 'I'd be sitting on the couch, doing nothing. You can just imagine a normal anxiety attack, like a public speaking engagement. 
'And a tiny little thing like that, over time, over and over, became debilitating.” 
A fellow veteran pulled him aside with a solution: The Headstrong Project, a group founded four years ago by combat-decorated Marine Corps officer Zach Iscol to assist his fellow American fighters scarred by invisible wounds.

BREAKING ALL THE RULES hosts SARTRE Commentary. BATR.org and BATR.net Globalist Plan for Human Control By Sartre on November 8, 2016 
Recognizing that there is and has been a century's long shrouded plan to mastermind a worldwide Weltanschauung that puts a diabolical elite mastery over the billions of human beings, which make up the vast hordes of divinely created life on this planet, is a taboo topic in most cultures. The entire system of socially manufactured perception is a plot to keep people in line and docile. Mass societal pressure is dumped on anyone, who dares to put forth a confederacy organism of global rule explanation for understanding political, social and economic affairs. Keeping the enigma program for extending a cruel and deadly supremacy over mankind cannot be kept secret any longer. 
A brief and concise definition of The Globalist Agenda follows: 
'Simply put, the globalist movement is an alliance based on self-interest of the private international financiers and the royal, dynastic and hereditary land owning families of Britain, Europe and America which over the years have intermarried to create a self regenerating power structure that through lies and deception seeks to control everything and everyone on earth.” 
Review the glaring elements that make up the demented mindset and ultimate objections of these demonic demons devoted to their satanic master. 
Elite Belief System / Values 
The Ends Justify the Means Mystery Religions / Occult 
Population Reduction to less than 1 Billion people Post Industrial Feudalism Transhumanism End of the Age – New Age 
This summary of attitudes and aims might not be earth shattering for dedicated observers of the power elite, but for those who avoid any appearance of being tagged as a tin foil wearing conspiracy kook, mustering up the courage to confront the facts of real history may be too much to contemplate. Nullifying one's comfort zone, even if it is totally false, is not an attribute for those who never developed character of sincerity or intellectual honesty. 
Prof. Dr. MUJAHID KAMRAN provides a well documented account of Who Really Controls the World? Coming from a non Western perspective, it is most encouraging that the exposure of the force beyond the scene is resonating in every corner of the planet. 
'The wealthiest families on planet earth call the shots in every major upheaval that they cause. Their sphere of activity extends over the entire globe, and even beyond, their ambition and greed for wealth and power knows no bounds, and for them, most of mankind is garbage – 'human garbage.” It is also their target to depopulate the globe and maintain a much lower population compared to what we have now.” 
When The Communist Takeover Of America – 45 Declared Goals from ' The Naked Communist ,” by Cleon Skousen was published, most people were diverted to thinking that a Marxist ideology was the primary enemy during the cold war. Left to the perceptive and astute, the most informed understand that the totalitarian creed of collectivism was originated and implemented by Jews. The influence of designed destruction for Western institutions and heritage, which facilitate and spreads the New World Order power structure, is the sacred canon of the privileged Globalist elites. 
A serious researcher cannot ignore or circumvent this historic fact. Academic censorship would have the timid stay clear of this detail to avoid being smeared as a critic of the 'so called” chosen tribe. Those who buy into this asinine prerequisite, which is the height of chutzpah, would be petrified to actually review the sentiments of What world famous men said about the Jews . 
Now not every wicked globalist is exclusively Jewish. However, the proportion of Judaic race identity and Talmud proponents within the Globalist circle of black magic is overwhelmingly disproportionate to their population numbers. Also, there is no one single mythos viewpoint among globalists as The Two Jewish-led Globalist Camps… In Competition For Global Control illustrates. 'There are two distinct ideological globalist camps, both led by Jews — each camp competes with the other for global control: 1) THE LIBERAL CAMP 2) THE NEOCON CAMP” 
The inquiry into the influence of Jewish Faces in the Government can fill several books. Yet, the bias against covering this topic is so strong that only brave souls venture into the cauldron of popular culture ostracization. 
If you have the courage to venture where most will not dare, take a close look at the lists provided on THE GLOBALISTS site. The lead rundown presents: 'The global elite march in four essential columns: Corporate, Academic, Political and Organized Religion . In general, the goals for globalism are created by Corporate. Academic then provides studies and white papers that justify Corporate goals. Political sells Academic's arguments to the public and if necessary, changes laws to accommodate and facilitate Corporate in getting what it wants. Organized Religion along with church and state secures corporate, academic and political rule into a global order.” 
The lists of oligarch families, Committee of 300 and organized groups of the ruling class is a combination of dynasty elements that make up their cabal syndicate of power and dominance. The Rothschild linage bears the most attention for the central blood line of the international finance and the global cartel. Nevertheless, the choreographed architecture for governance goes well beyond an analysis of money, politics and force. 
In order to restrict the world view and impose a rigid abidance into an occult Babylonian religion, The Globalist Agenda contends: New Religion Based on Earth Worship 
'Today, the elite are seeking to destroy the old religious belief systems and replace them with a 'new age” religion based on a form of earth worship. Doing so will accomplish multiple objectives – to get people to accept lower standards of living; to accept voluntary sterilization to save mother earth thus helping to depopulate the planet; and to accept restrictions on rights and freedoms in the name of saving the environment.” 
The Globalist Plan to take-down the whole World by Preston James, Ph.D postulates: 
' Set up a comprehensive multi-level secret Luciferian matrix used to induce and promote selected individuals who are willing to do anti-human debased acts in exchange for extreme rewards of fame, money and power in return for their willingness to give up their souls. This provides a cadre of deeply committed sold-out top controllers who can be later disposed of when no longer needed. With abject secrecy their whole system becomes exposed and crumbles.” 
This certainly sounds similar to the way the Plutocrat Jewery deviltry operates. For an evaluation on how The Dark Agenda Behind Globalism And Open Borders works, Zero Hedge sounds a familiar theme. 
' The people behind the effort to enforce globalism are tied together by a particular ideology, perhaps even a cult-like religion , in which they envision a world order as described in Plato's Republic. They believe that they are 'chosen” either by fate, destiny or genetics to rule as philosopher kings over the rest of us. They believe that they are the wisest and most capable that humanity has to offer , and that through evolutionary means, they can create chaos and order out of thin air and mold society at will.” 
Now what group of self proclaimed super elites does this most scrupulously describe? 
The globalist plan for human servitude and ultimate liquidation is a direct result of the hubris from these deranged omnipotent imposters. Only through a sincere and dedicated investigation into the working of the ' Khazarian Mafia ”, a term penned by Dr. James, can one begin to comprehend the nature of the pandemic ethos that is at the core of the globalist cult. 
Who better to conclude a dissecting of the Globalist Plan for Human Control than the teaching of Texe Marrs? From his Exclusive Intelligence Examiner Report you get an account you will not read in the controlled media. 
'Children of hell, that's what Jesus called the Jewish religious teachers. That was almost 2,000 years ago. Well, guess what? The Jewish religionists are even worse now, in the 21st century. They've had almost 2,000 years more to practice and perfect their evil religion. Today, those who practice satanic cabalism and believe in the Talmud are the children of hell a hundred times over.” 
The globalists adopt the practices and mores of this perversion from the Old Testament faith of Moses, Isaac, Jacob, and the prophets. Their design for a soulless existence and final mass annihilation is the essence of archfiend wickedness. The New World Order structure of global submission basically wants to remove free will from the human condition. 
Every thinking and God fearing person must resist and oppose the autocracy of the Tempter for global secularization. As more individuals assimilate into a reprobate culture that lacks faith in the divine word of God, the end collapse of society and all decency is inevitable.

PTSD: Identification and Compensation By Matt Hill on November 8, 2016 
Post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is a condition that's both underestimated and misunderstood, especially when it comes to the Veterans Association. PTSD is actually a common condition. The Mayo Clinic estimates that more than 3 million Americans are diagnosed with PTSD every year — and that doesn't take into account those individuals who never receive a diagnosis. 
PTSD develops when an individual has witnessed or experienced a traumatic or terrifying event. Unsurprisingly, it's a condition that's particularly prevalent among veterans. Although the VA estimates that 10-15% of veterans will develop PTSD at some point following their military service, it's entirely possible these numbers might actually be much higher in reality. 
PTSD is classified as a trauma and stressor-related disorder. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the condition is characterized as a repetitive re-experiencing of an extremely traumatic event (or stressor), usually accompanied by increased arousal, nightmares, and flashbacks. Those who have PTSD often have trouble concentrating, remembering, and sleeping. 
But a PTSD diagnosis is not always easy to come by. The manifestation of the condition is not always straight-forward and doesn't appear in the same way from person to person. It may take months or even years to develop, and symptoms may shift or appear over time. To diagnose a case of PTSD, physicians will look at specific criteria for symptoms. There are four distinct groups of criteria, all with different symptoms. These groups are: Intrusion Symptoms —Nightmares, intrusive memories or thoughts, or psychological and physical reactions to memories of the event. Avoidance Symptoms —Avoiding situations, thoughts, or feelings that you associate with the traumatic event. Negative Changes in Cognitions and Mood —Memory issues, negative thoughts about themselves or others, severe emotions like shame or sadness, lack of interest in activities they once enjoyed, or feelings of detachment, isolation, or disconnection. Changes in Arousal and Reactivity —An easy startle response, or feeling constantly jittery or alert. 
It's easy to see how these symptoms could easily disrupt a person's life and take a significant toll on their mental health, as well as their personal and professional life. If you or someone you love may be suffering from PTSD, it's important to seek out help. Because PTSD presents itself differently in every patient, treatment must be sought and tailor-made for each individual. Although there is no cure for PTSD, treatment has proven to be very effective for the majority of patients. Typically, this treatment includes psychotherapy — including cognitive and exposure therapy, as well as regular appointments with a psychiatrist — and in some cases, medication. 
If you are a veteran who has been diagnosed with PTSD, you may be entitled to receive benefits and compensation from the VA. There are many things that you need to know to get the benefits that you deserve, and the veterans advocates at Hill & Ponton have published a PTSD guide covering everything regarding a PTSD claim. In years past, veterans were required to provide evidence of the traumatic event that led to the development of their condition. Below are some of the important points in the guide on how to establish service connection and get the proper rating. 
The first thing is to establish a service connection for your PTSD in order to be eligible for benefits. The three things the VA requires are: Current Diagnosis: you must have a current PTSD diagnosis that was given by professionals who the VA has deemed 'qualified to perform PTSD Compensation and Pension examinations.” These professionals have doctoral-level training in diagnostic methods, clinical interview methods, and psychopathology. They also need to have a working knowledge of the DSM-V and have extensive clinical experience with both the diagnosis and treatment in veterans with PTSD. Typically, these are board-certified psychiatrists and licensed psychologists, but may also include psychiatric residents and psychology interns as long as they're under close supervision of an attending professional in the field. Essentially, if you've received a current PTSD diagnosis from a licensed professional, that analysis satisfies this requirement. Please note: most VA hospitals and clinics employ licensed mental health social workers to treat veterans. Their diagnosis of PTSD alone is not enough to meet this requirement. In-Service Stressor: This might be the most difficult requirement to satisfy. Sometimes, trauma is easy to determine, but other times, proving its occurrence can be challenging. There are a lot of different regulations regarding the type of trauma you experienced. For example, the rules for determining fear of terrorist activity are different from veterans who engaged in combat or sexual trauma. It's recommended that you consult with your psychiatrist or psychologist, as well as a qualified lawyer, to address this requirement. Nexus: Basically, this is the link between the first two requirements. It's what connects the traumatic event you experienced with your current diagnosis of PTSD. A medical expert is required in order to explain how your symptoms are a direct result of your in-service stressor — which is especially important if you have multiple stressors. It's vital you establish that the traumatic event is the definitive link to your diagnosis and cannot be explained by any other events that took place outside of your military service. 
Once these requirements have been satisfied, you can then file a claim through the VA. If you file a claim, you'll need to undergo a Compensation and Pension Examination (sometimes called a C&P Exam) to verify your diagnoses, assess symptom severity, and definitively determine whether your PTSD is directly related to your military service. The VA treats the C&P exam with a lot of weight and it will determine the amount of compensation you receive. 
When you go to your exam, remember to be as honest and as forthcoming as possible. You should bring written statements from family or friends that say how your PTSD has impacted your life. You should also bring a list of symptoms you've experienced to help you when being questioned during the exam. 
After the exam, you will be assigned a disability percentage rate. This percentage reflects how severe your condition is and how much the symptoms affect your ability to work and maintain social relationships. Depending on the severity of your PTSD, you could potentially receive a disability rate of 0%, 10%, 30%, 70%, or 100%. 
Overall, the compensation you receive will be related to your estimated impairment of working ability. Above all, it's important to demonstrate evidence of occupational impairment due to PTSD. Even if your symptoms don't constitute a 100% disability rating, you may still be able to receive one through a TDIU, which stands for total disability based on individual unemployability. A TDIU may be assigned if an individual fails to meet the criteria for 100% disability but is still completely unable to obtain and maintain employment. 
Because the way the VA determines disability percentages can be highly confusing and complex, working with a lawyer who specializes in VA claims may be to your benefit. The various rules and regulations for determining physical disability can be hard to navigate, but mental conditions like PTSD can be even more difficult to prove. That's why having an expert on your side can be vital. 
If you or someone you love may be suffering from PTSD as a result of military service, seek out assistance from an attorney who specializes in veterans' issues. Alternatively, if you are dissatisfied with a disability rating you have received and aren't receiving the benefits you need, there may be other options at your disposal.

‹ › Arnaldo Rodgers is a trained and educated Psychologist. He has worked as a community organizer and activist. 'Honor Our Immigrant Veterans” Replayed By Arnaldo Rodgers on November 8, 2016 Veterans By elizawhig 
'Honor Our Immigrant Veterans” from VoteVets is a video on Youtube I tripped over recently, and have watched several times. It is that good. Another Kossack may have already posted it, but I would like to get it some play. Not because I think it will change any voter's mind, but because it deserves to be seen to remind us of who we are as Americans. We are all immigrants or the children of immigrants, and we and our relatives and grandparents have had to make tough choices that deserve to be remembered. 
I had an uncle (by marriage) who was Italian. In 1940 he was still not a US citizen, although I gather he had begun the process, so he was sent to an internment camp in Wyoming (or Montana?). While he waited for his citizenship application to be completed, he and his fellow detainees played a lot of poker. His papers were finally processed, he was made a US Citizen, then was promptly drafted into the US Army as a Sargent (Supply). And of course he was sent to…Italy. His division survived Anzio, then my uncle came into his glory. His father was someone of importance further north, so he had connections. He was able to secure excellent billets (in a castle) and good food and drink for his comrades.

World Heaves Sigh of Relief after Trump's Victory By Finian Cunningham on November 9, 2016 A reflection of how disconnected the Western political class are from their own people.

SPUTNIK 
The election of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the US certainly sent shockwaves around the world. But perhaps the uppermost sense is one of huge relief that Hillary Clinton was kept out of the White House. 
For most ordinary citizens around the world, Clinton, her multi-billion-dollar election campaign and the fawning corporate media coverage represented everything that is perceived as fundamentally wrong in Western politics. 
Her cronyism goes so far that she would not hesitate to start a world war with Russia, or whoever, in order to appease her corporate sponsors and indulge her deluded notion of 'exceptional liberalism”. 
Trump's stunning victory is a victory for common people and common sense. Despite the Western media's systematic shielding of Clinton from criticism, a good number of ordinary Americans and other nationals around the world could clearly see her irredeemable flaws. 
She is a self-enriching puppet for Big Finance and the military-industrial complex. And, as her email scandal shows, a consummate liar on top. Donald Trump is a billionaire property tycoon with a big mouth and uncouth manner. He has never held an elected office before. It is unprecedented that he should become the president of the US. 
Donald Trump is a billionaire property tycoon with a big mouth and uncouth manner. He has never held an elected office before. It is unprecedented that he should become the president of the US. 
Will he really 'make America great again”? Will he really deliver on massive infrastructure investments to regenerate impoverished working-class communities across America? We don't know if he just an opportunist conman, or if he really does have a humble heart to reach out to all the 'forgotten people” that he speaks about. One can hope. 
But one thing is for sure. Trump is no warmonger. And he doesn't seem to be a puppet that can be pushed around. 
'We will deal fairly with everyone” 
In one of the live TV debates with Clinton during the campaign, Trump surprised many viewers when he said, apparently sincerely, that he would never commit a first-strike nuclear attack against any nation. It took a lot of guts and moral integrity to say that. Clinton didn't answer the question, but her past record as Secretary of State shows that she has no hesitation about launching illegal wars and murdering foreign heads of state. 
Trump has also spoken several times about restoring friendly relations with America's biggest nuclear rival Russia. He took a lot of heat for that from the Clinton campaign and the biased US media, who accused him of being a 'stooge” for Russian President Vladimir Putin. To his credit, Trump did not cave in to the anachronistic 'Russian baiting”, which has been a staple of American politics for decades. During his acceptance speech as President-elect, Trump repeated his oft-mentioned desire for the US to base its foreign relations on 'partnership” instead of 'hostility and conflict”. 
Notably, Russia's Vladimir Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump on winning the White House. Reciprocating goodwill, Putin said he hoped to work with Trump so that Russia and the US can 'restore relations from their current critical condition”. 
Surely, this is the point. To replace outmoded ideological stereotypes and animosity with a pragmatic mutual respect to cooperate. Russia and its leader are not the enemy of the US, Europe nor the rest of the world – unless you are a terrorist network seeking illicit regime change. Architects of Endless 'Regime Change” wars 
Russia and its leader are not the enemy of the US, Europe nor the rest of the world – unless you are a terrorist network seeking illicit regime change. 
The people who have demonized Russia are ideologues in Washington and their surrogates among European governments and the Western corporate media. That negative image of Russia does not match reality as ordinary people perceive it, including many ordinary Americans. Russia did not destabilize Ukraine. It did not annex Crimea. Russia was not involved in shooting down a civilian airliner. It is not massacring civilians in Syria. In Syria, it is helping a sovereign state defeat terrorist mercenaries in a US-sponsored covert war for regime change. Russia is not a sports-drug pariah. It is not hacking computer systems nor subverting foreign democracies. These are all just false ideological constructs manufactured by the Western establishment and its subservient media. 
Ordinary citizens around the world, especially those in the US, know that. Their real-world concerns are dealing with poverty, unemployment and crumbling societies. This stuff about 'Putin being the new Hitler” and 'threatening the free world” is just so much baloney. 
Maybe because Trump is not a career politician or a Washington insider he knows all that too. And he knows that ordinary Americans are not being listened to by the establishment. That's why Trump's victory comes as such a shock. 
The political class have been so wrong on almost every issue, whether it was the Brexit and discontent with the European Union, or foreign relations with Russia, or Trump's chances of winning the presidency. 
The Western political class have gotten it so wrong on so many issues because it is divorced from the reality as it affects most people. Aloof, elitist, out of touch and undemocratic. 
Yet this Western ruling class, as embodied by Hillary Clinton, would be prepared to start even more wars around the world than they already have, based on their own twisted self-serving logic. 
Consider these figures just released by the Pentagon. Under President Obama – who advocated for Clinton – US military exports to Saudi Arabia and other Mideast despots are double the amount under George W Bush. This weapons supply has gone towards arming jihadi terror groups. Clinton approved of this arms bazaar for terrorists when she was in office as part of Washington's regime-change schemes. Fooling the masses – Defeated 
Yet these people like Obama and Clinton spout all sorts of 'humanitarian” and 'moralistic” mumbo-jumbo. They are liars. And they are the most cynical of corrupt politicians. The very breed of politician-puppets that ordinary decent people around the world have come to despise. 
Trump, for all his personal flaws, is in a different category. He is astute enough to know that the pain of ordinary citizens stems from a badly broken economic system. Can an arch capitalist like Trump fix chronic capitalism? It's doubtful, unless he radically shifts to a new form of socialist policy. 
But the main good thing about Trump is that he is a pragmatist who at least appears to be on the side of ordinary people and on the side of restoring peaceful relations with other nations, Russia in particular. 
The prominent people dejected about Trump are the political class both in the US and Europe and their media echo chambers. It is notable that Germany's Merkel and France's Hollande both affected an air of disapproval over Trump's victory – unlike Putin who magnanimously congratulated. Hollande said he would be 'vigilant” in his future dealings with Trump. What is he talking about? 
That's why Merkel and Hollande will be next to get kicked out of office in forthcoming elections. Like Obama, Clinton and the American establishment, the pro-US European ruling parties are so out of touch with reality. 
The demonization of Russia is a reflection of how disconnected the Western political class are from their own people. Ordinary people around the world want jobs, prosperity and peace. They know they can't afford futile hostilities with Russia as have been foisted on them by their rulers, while such urgent social needs go neglected. Crazy as it may seem, Trump's win may be a chance for the US to redeem. And for the world to heave a huge sigh of relief.

  Without intention, Mike kind fulfills the proverb that not all who wander are lost. A 1973 graduate of the College of the Holy Cross with a BA in Philosophy, he had successfully dodged the draft during Vietnam, despite his lottery number of 29. Logically, after failing at being a bum for a year after college, he then enlisted in the Army. His theory was to hang out for two years, go to Germany, date blondes, drink lots of beer, improve his wretched German and come home to use the GI Bill for Graduate School. Didn't quite work out that way; he did go to Germany and stayed five years first tour; married a red-headed American GI who worked in S2; did drink lots of beer and developed some acuity with pidgin Deutsch. Mike re-enlisted and then wandered through a great 23 years as a soldier. A lot of it sucked, of course; but, he avoided ending his adolescence until the end of the 23 years…since then, he's been in a fight to regain that feeling of camaraderie, purpose and trust. Mike chose to stay a career NCO. There were a couple of dozen reasons, but they're best summed up by the fact that he really didn't like officers. He still doesn't, sheepishly at times admitting that 'Some of my best friends are officers. Some of my best friends are gay. Some of my best friends are gay officers. I'm not gay and I'm not an officer – I like it better that way.” He got his initial First Sergeant assignment in his 14th year and basically stayed a First Sergeant until he retired, as a First Sergeant. If he hadn't retired, the day after the retirement would have been the day he pinned on CSM stripes but, as he says, 'Some of my best friends are Sergeant Majors; some of my best friends are hookers. I'm not a Sergeant Major and I'm not a hooker and that works fine for me.” Since retiring, Mike's worked in Labor Relations, HR and General Management for government, tribes, nonprofits and for profits including Defense Contractors. He's found that his 'not being a hooker” approach hasn't necessarily worked to his career advantage. He's picked up a bunch of irrelevant graduate degrees, that basically were there to teach you how to be a Hobbit. Hobbits are small, insignificant fearful types who scurry around getting in the way and accomplishing nothing of any great merit. He believes that the movies would have been infinitely better had the bad guys killed off all the Hobbits in the first part of the first movie, and then spent the rest of it avenging the little twits. Mike really hates Hobbits He's a Senior Professional in Human Resources and a Six Sigma Black Belt. He plays guitar, reads, broods and drives too fast in fast cars – currently, a Mustang GT – channeling Hunter S. Thompson, patrolling 'on the edge of the desert, just outside of Barstow.” An avowed leftist and philosophical Stoic, Mike admits that everything is probably going to hell, but thinks that it's the duty of people of honor to work to stop it from going there too quick. Since he regards all veterans as his extended family, he expects that they'll do the same. An oddly religious guy, Mike believes that God is a not very bright, self—entered and hormonal teenage girl obsessed with the Jonas Brothers and whether or not her Daisy Duke jeans make her ass look fat. They do, but he's not going to be the one to tell her the truth. God can't handle the truth. While he might write about anything, he's really interested in business, economics and how to keep people from being screwed by machines, be they corporate, government, or societal. He's also interested in guitars... Dispatches from Wolf Country –Sitting in my cave, watching the spider spin By Mike Farrell on November 9, 2016 I didn't think much of Donald Trump. I still don't -- I think he's a vulgar, crooked, misogynistic, racist, elitist, intellectually stunted, narcissistic, naive and utterly unprepared to be president. I think Mike Pence is a right wing troll. The thought of Newt Gingrich as Secretary of State and Rudy Giuliani as Secretary of State and Attorney General makes my skin crawl. Well, that's fine. I voted, and had my say. Now I have to deal with reality. Like it or not, we have to be adult about this. A man's got to have a code, a creed to live by, no matter his job. –John Wayne 
Lord, she never even stopped She left fifty or sixty people still sittin' on their cars And they're wonderin' what it's comin' to And how it got this far Oh but me I got a nickel smashed flatter than a dime By a mad dog, runaway red-silver streamline…train Guy Clark, Texas 1947 
As the election slogs on to the end, I've been relatively quiet. There was a lot to digest, a lot to think about. Obviously not in the election campaigns; they've been short of thought. But the implications of the demographic change in the USA, the failure of our education system, the stubbornness of entrenched wealth, and the lack of intellectual vibrancy, integrity and should provide a lot things to think about going forward. The Trump experience is going to be with us for a long time. What other people — historians, political scientists, theologians, journalists, and leaders — call American Constitutional Democracy, he condemns as a rigged system. As Bill Mahar has pointed out frequently, 'When is a rich white guy in this country going to get an even break!” In an odd way, it's true — in any contest against the rich white guys, the odds for them are always 60-40; for the rest of us, that means our odds are 60-40 against. Well, the early 20th century with Wilson Minzer contended pretty successfully that in life, the odds are always 60-40 against. I think that's hell of an advantage people like Trump have to screw up just to face the same odds most of us face in getting through life. The thing in this election that will probably make the difference is that sometimes wealth is money, sometimes it's access to media, and sometimes it's something else. In this election, it's something else. Farrell, November 6, 2016 

And then, boys and girls, I turned away from the computer because I realized that I wasn't sure what it was that I wanted to say. Like a lot of folks from the Northeast who paid attention to New York City, I didn't think much of Donald Trump. I still don't — I think he's a vulgar, crooked, misogynistic, racist, elitist, intellectually stunted, narcissistic, naive and utterly unprepared to be president. I think Mike Pence is a right wing troll. The thought of Newt Gingrich as Secretary of State and Rudy Giuliani as Secretary of State and Attorney General makes my skin crawl. 
Well, that's fine. I voted, and had my say. Now I have to deal with a reality as a responsible citizen and patriot. Like it or not, we have to be adult about this. I think the best advice ever for an actual American who cares about his country and what it stands for was given by Marion Mitchell Morrison, better known as John Wayne, the week after the election in 1960. 
Progressives would regard Wayne as a Wingnut. He was a Goldwater Republican and a fierce patriot. He defined manhood for a couple of generations of boys and men; it's an image that defined manhood for a lot of people. His characters weren't him; he wasn't his characters, but I think he was inspired by a lot of them to be something more than he was. He pushed himself to be something more than he was. He had a lot of warts, but ultimately he faced them, wore them and didn't let them get in his way. I'm not sure who the equivalent character would be in cinema today — George Clooney? It's actually pretty simple, there is known. I suspect it's probably Bruce Springsteen for a lot of people, because of the impact of rock and roll on my generation and those that follow it. 
Wayne was asked what he thought about Kennedy's election and Nixon's defeat. His response was simple, straight and honest. I didn't vote for him but he's my president, and I hope he does a good job. –John Wayne 
That quote is fairly well known and often quoted, usually by progressives pointing out the problems with Conservative Obstruction and totally absurd complaints. That use has been justified. But, a lesser known quote from the Duke on the inauguration of Jimmy Carter is worth considering now. 
I'm pleased to be present and accounted for in this capital of freedom to witness history as it happens – to watch a common man accept the uncommon responsibility he won ‘fair and square' by stating his case to the American people – not by bloodshed, be-headings, and riots at the palace gates. I know I'm a member of the loyal opposition – accent on the loyal. I'd have it no other way. John Wayne, Washington, DC. January 20, 1977 
So, President Trump, as did President Obama, will have a unique opportunity to do something. I do not think Trump has the temperament and the knowledge to be a great president but like Wayne, what the hell do I know? He isn't a politician and he hasn't worked in government. I suspect he's in for a steep learning curve. I hope he has the wisdom to find some people to advise him who have that kind of experience so that he can be successful. 

Like it or not, the election shows that we are in fact a badly divided commonwealth. There's little agreement across party lines on a wide variety of things. Some of those things are ontological — what's the nature of truth? How important is it? Does logic matter as much, more or less than emotion? What are the limits of discourse in public? What constitutes unreasonable insult and what constitutes reasonable epithet? How do you deal with disagreement? How do you discuss policy? How do you deal with the political problems caused by economic and demographic change? 
It's going to be interesting. President Trump has to satisfy his supporters while reconciling with those who oppose him. Since a lot of his supporters are conditioned to envy, mistrust and despise the rich bastards and Gatsby types — sound like anyone we know? — and a lot of his opponents are inclined to to distrust, despise and want restitution for his victory, it's going to be a Herculean task for the guy to get them to agree on whether to order chicken, hamburgers or fish at a team building retreat, let alone actually do anything. 
I have to think that President Obama has had an interesting morning as well. Trump doesn't have majorities like Obama had in Congress in 2009 and has a somewhat more disgruntled electorate. While I'm sure Obama may be tempted to short sheet the beds and put Icy Hot on the toilet seats in the Executive Mansion, I suspect he'll be gracious and do whatever he can to assist President Trump to a smooth and reasonable transition. 
I think Lincoln had the best advice for all of us as this unfolds. Be nice if we could agree to it and be scored against it. With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations. — Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural, March 4, 1865

Russia did not destabilize Ukraine. It did not annex Crimea. Russia was not involved in shooting down a civilian airliner. It is not massacring civilians in Syria. In Syria, it is helping a sovereign state defeat terrorist mercenaries in a US-sponsored covert war for regime change. Russia is not a sports-drug pariah. It is not hacking computer systems nor subverting foreign democracies. These are all just false ideological constructs manufactured by the Western establishment and its subservient media. 
Ordinary citizens around the world, especially those in the US, know that. Their real-world concerns are dealing with poverty, unemployment and crumbling societies. This stuff about 'Putin being the new Hitler” and 'threatening the free world” is just so much baloney. 
Maybe because Trump is not a career politician or a Washington insider he knows all that too. And he knows that ordinary Americans are not being listened to by the establishment. That's why Trump's victory comes as such a shock. 
The political class have been so wrong on almost every issue, whether it was the Brexit and discontent with the European Union, or foreign relations with Russia, or Trump's chances of winning the presidency. 
The Western political class have gotten it so wrong on so many issues because it is divorced from the reality as it affects most people. Aloof, elitist, out of touch and undemocratic. 
Yet this Western ruling class, as embodied by Hillary Clinton, would be prepared to start even more wars around the world than they already have, based on their own twisted self-serving logic. 
Consider these figures just released by the Pentagon. Under President Obama – who advocated for Clinton – US military exports to Saudi Arabia and other Mideast despots are double the amount under George W Bush. This weapons supply has gone towards arming jihadi terror groups. Clinton approved of this arms bazaar for terrorists when she was in office as part of Washington's regime-change schemes. 
Yet these people like Obama and Clinton spout all sorts of 'humanitarian” and 'moralistic” mumbo-jumbo. They are liars. And they are the most cynical of corrupt politicians. The very breed of politician-puppets that ordinary decent people around the world have come to despise. Americans Not Fooled by 'Presidential Campaign Tricks' 
Trump, for all his personal flaws, is in a different category. He is astute enough to know that the pain of ordinary citizens stems from a badly broken economic system. 
The main good thing about Trump is that he is a pragmatist who at least appears to be on the side of ordinary people and on the side of restoring peaceful relations with other nations, Russia in particular. 
The prominent people dejected about Trump are the political class both in the US and Europe and their media echo chambers. 
It is notable that Germany's Merkel and France's Hollande both affected an air of disapproval over Trump's victory – unlike Putin who magnanimously congratulated. Hollande said he would be 'vigilant” in his future dealings with Trump. What is he talking about? 
That's why Merkel and Hollande will be next to get kicked out of office in forthcoming elections. Like Obama, Clinton and the American establishment, the pro-US European ruling parties are so out of touch with reality. 
The demonization of Russia is a reflection of how disconnected the Western political class are from their own people. Ordinary people around the world want jobs, prosperity and peace. They know they can't afford futile hostilities with Russia as have been foisted on them by their rulers, while such urgent social needs go neglected. 
Crazy as it may seem, Trump's win may be a chance for the US to redeem. And for the world to heave a huge sigh of relief.

BY JONATHAN WINSLOW 
Handy Park has been dyed with a sea of red, white and blue as more than 1,700 flags have been placed to create the Field of Valor, honoring those who have fought and are still fighting for the country's freedoms. 
This is the second annual Field of Valor event, held by the Community Foundation of Orange. Susie Cunningham, executive director of the foundation, said it wasn't certain if last year's event would take off at all, but a powerful community response enabled this year's event to be much more ambitious. 
The main draw is the same as last year: 1,776 American flags lining the park. Each flag represents either a veteran or an active service member with a tag telling a bit about the person. These provided tags can be as detailed as listing out medals and commendations won in Vietnam, or as simple as remembering that a grandparent served in the Navy during World War II.

With Veterans Day coming on Friday, marketing meisters at WalletHub have released a list ranking the best U.S. cities for military veterans. 
Out of the 100 biggest cities in the nation, St. Louis checks in at No. 79. 
The listers noted that four main categories with a total of 21 key indicators, such as percentage of military skill-related jobs and availability of VA health facilities, were used to compile the list. 
The only category in which our fair burg finished in the upper half, at No. 46, was 'quality of life.” We were in the lower half for the other three main categories: job rank (69th), health (70th) and economy (80). 
On the west side of the state, Kansas City was ranked at No. 30, fourth among cities in the Midwest. (Omaha, Tulsa and Oklahoma City fared better.)

Raine McMullen pushes certain chapters of the 10 months she spent in Afghanistan to the back of her mind. 
There are things she saw and heard and experienced while deployed there that she doesn't like to talk about. But the children? She will never forget them and is always eager to share their stories. 
'They were so curious of the American soldiers,” said McMullen, who spent six years with the Army Reserve's 412th Civil Affairs Battalion, based at the Defense Supply Center Columbus in Whitehall. 'And they were especially curious of me because I was the only female on my whole base.”

  ACLU Threatens War Against President Trump   The ACLU has a message for Donald Trump. They are not impressed with many of Trump's campaign promises, and threaten the new president-elect with court if he tries to implement them. 
The ACLU has a message for Donald Trump. 
NEW YORK — In response to Donald Trump's election as president of the United States, Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union , had the following statement: 
'For nearly 100 years, the American Civil Liberties Union has been the nation's premier defender of freedom and justice for all, no matter who is president. Our role is no different today. 
'President-elect Trump, as you assume the nation's highest office, we urge you to reconsider and change course on certain campaign promises you have made. These include your plan to amass a deportation force to remove 11 million undocumented immigrants; ban the entry of Muslims into our country and aggressively surveil them; punish women for accessing abortion; reauthorize waterboarding and other forms of torture; and change our nation's libel laws and restrict freedom of expression. 
'These proposals are not simply un-American and wrong-headed, they are unlawful and unconstitutional. They violate the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. If you do not reverse course and instead endeavor to make these campaign promises a reality, you will have to contend with the full firepower of the ACLU at every step. Our staff of litigators and activists in every state, thousands of volunteers, and millions of card-carrying supporters are ready to fight against any encroachment on our cherished freedoms and rights. 
'One thing is certain: we will be eternally vigilant every single day of your presidency and when you leave the Oval Office, we will do the same with your successor.

  CALEXIT 2019: Powerful California To Become New Independent Country   40 million Economically Powerful Californians Sickened by White Nationalism & KKK Confederate Racists Don't Want Trump's Racist Bigoted America! Time to Say Goodbye! 
Last nights horrific devastating Presidential election results have sparked a fire that Trump's Racist USA will NOT be able to put out! The 2019 #Calexit Independence Referendum movement has has caught fire! 
In the Spring of 2019, Californians will go to the polls in a historic vote to decide by referendum if California should exit the Union, a #Calexit vote. 
You will have this historic opportunity because the Yes California Independence Campaign will qualify a citizen's initiative for the 2018 ballot that if passed would call for a special election for Californians to vote for or against the independence of California from the United States. Sign Up Now To Support Calexit 2019 >>> 
This is a very important question. It is the responsibility of this campaign to explain what a yes vote will mean for you, your family, your community, our state, our country, and our world. We have designed this website to answer many of these questions and look to you to ask more. 
'As the sixth largest economy in the world, California is more economically powerful than France and has a population larger than Poland. Point by point, California compares and competes with countries, not just the 49 other states.” 
In our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children. 
Although charity is part of our culture, when you consider that California's infrastructure is falling apart, our public schools are ranked among the worst in the entire country, we have the highest number of homeless persons living without shelter and other basic necessities, poverty rates remain high, income inequality continues to expand, and we must often borrow money from the future to provide services for today, now is not the time for charity. 
However, this independence referendum is about more than California subsidizing other states of this country. It is about the right to self-determination and the concept of voluntary association, both of which are supported by constitutional and international law. 
It is about California taking its place in the world, standing as an equal among nations. We believe in two fundamental truths: (1) California exerts a positive influence on the rest of the world, and (2) California could do more good as an independent country than it is able to do as a just a U.S. state. 
In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the international community with their 'Brexit” vote. Our 'Calexit” referendum is about California joining the international community. You have a big decision to make. Related Posts:

By Paul Craig Roberts on November 9, 2016 It seems that the oligarchs were deceived by their own media propaganda. Donald Trump has won a stunning victory over Hillary Clinton, wrongfooting investors around the world and defying Republican and Democratic political elites with his populist 'Drain the Swamp” and 'Make America Great Again” movement. 
by Paul Craig Roberts 
The US presidential election is historic, because the American people were able to defeat the oligarchs. 
Hillary Clinton, an agent for the Oligarchy, was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against Donald Trump. This shows that the media and the political establishments of the political parties no longer have credibility with the American people. 
It remains to be seen whether Trump can select and appoint a government that will serve him and his goals to restore American jobs and to establish friendly and respectful   China, Syria, and Iran. 
It also remains to be seen how the Oligarchy will respond to Trump's victory. Wall Street and the Federal Reserve can cause an economic crisis in order to put Trump on the defensive, and they can use the crisis to force Trump to appoint one of their own as Secretary of the Treasury. Rogue agents in the CIA and Pentagon can cause a false flag attack that would disrupt   Russia. 
Trump could make a mistake and retain neoconservatives in his government. 
With Trump there is at least hope. Unless Trump is obstructed by bad judgment in his appointments and by obstacles put in his way, we should expect an end to Washington's orchestrated conflict with Russia, the removal of the US missiles on Russia's border with Poland and Romania, the end of the conflict in Ukraine, and the end of Washington's effort to overthrow the Syrian government. However, achievements such as these imply the defeat of the US Oligarchy. Although Trump defeated Hillary, the Oligarchy still exists and is still powerful. NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. 
Trump said that he no longer sees the point of NATO 25 years after the Soviet collapse. If he sticks to his view, it means a big political change in Washington's EU vassals. The hostility toward Russia of the current EU and NATO officials would have to cease. German Chancellor Merkel would have to change her spots or be replaced. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg would have to be dismissed. 
We do not know who Trump will select to serve in his government. It is likely that Trump is unfamiliar with the various possibilities and their positions on issues. It really depends on who is advising Trump and what advice they give him. 
Once we see his government, we will know whether we can be hopeful for the changes that now have a chance. 
If the oligarchy is unable to control Trump and he is actually successful in curbing the power and budget of the military/security complex and in holding the financial sector politically accountable, Trump could be assassinated.   Wars 
Trump said that he will put Hillary in prison. He should first put her on trial for treason and war crimes along with all of the neoconservatives. That would clear the decks for peace with the other two major nuclear powers over whom the neoconservatives seek hegemony. 
Although the neoconservatives would still have contacts in the hidden deep state, it would make it difficult for the vermin to organize false flag operations or an assassination. Rogue elements in the military/security complex could still pull off an assassination, but without neocons in the government a coverup would be more difficult. 
Trump has more understanding and insight than his opponents realize. For a man such as Trump to risk acquiring so many powerful enemies and to risk his wealth and reputation, he had to have known that the people's dissatisfaction with the ruling establishment meant he could be elected president. 
We won't know what to expect until we see who are the Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries. If it is the usual crowd, we will know Trump has been captured. 
A happy lasting result of the election is the complete discrediting of the US media. The media predicted an easy Hillary victory and even Democratic Party control of the US Senate. Even more important to the media's loss of influence and credibility, despite the vicious media attack on Trump throughout the presidential primaries and presidential campaign, the media had no effect outside the Northeast and West coasts, the stomping grounds of the One Percent. The rest of the country ignored the media. 
I did not think the Oligarchy would allow Trump to win. However, it seems that the oligarchs were deceived by their own media propaganda. Assured that Hillary was the sure winner, they were unprepared to put into effect plans to steal the election. 
Hillary is down, but not the Oligarchs. If Trump is advised to be conciliatory, to hold out his hand, and to take the establishment into his government, the American people will again be disappointed. In a country whose institutions have been so completely corrupted by the Oligarchy, it is difficult to achieve real change without bloodshed.

By Paul Craig Roberts on November 9, 2016 If only Trump could exile the lot of them. They are anti-American to the core. 
by Paul Craig Roberts 
The American electorate's preference for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders has established two facts. One is that the majority of the American people do not believe the media presstitutes. The other is that only the 'progressives” and 'liberals” who inhabit the Atlantic Northeast and Pacific West coasts believe the presstitutes. 
Trump's election to the presidency has confirmed these holier-than-thou souls in their strongly held belief that America is a white trash racist country. They have told us this all day long today. 
From these people and from the presstitutes we hear that white supremacy elected Trump. This is their propaganda, the intention of which is to discredit a Trump administration before it is inaugurated. Funny how white supremacy elected black Obama twice previously. 
Truthout has lost it completely. John Knefel declares 'The David Dukes of the World Prevail.” 
Kelly Hayes declares 'White Supremacy Elected Donald Trump.” 
William Rivers Pitt declares 'We have elected a fascist that Mussolini would have recognized on sight.” 
Hillary carried only a handful of states, the states that comprise the One Percent's stomping grounds. Yet Amy Goodman of Democracy Now sees meaning in political writer John Nichols claim that as Hillary carried New York and California, she won the popular vote and should be in the White House. 
I remember a few days ago George Soros saying that Trump would win the popular vote, but that the electoral vote would go to Hillary, thus ridding the oligarchs of Trump. 
Earth Justice promises to hold Trump accountable. Trump who promises to end the threat of nuclear war with Russia and China, thereby doing more to save animal and human life than the entirety of the Democratic Party and environmental organizations, is going to be held accountable by an organization that allegedly is beyond politics and is dedicated to preserving animals from destruction. 
The ACLU, of which I am a member, has also put 'on notice” the president-elect who has said he will save us from nuclear war. Faced with this idiocy from the ACLU, I will not renew my membership. 
Feminists tell us that we are 'grieving, scared, and in shock,” and that 'it is critical that we stand together and support each other.” 
Jeremy Ben-Ami of the J Street Jewish Community tells us that it is 'an incredibly sad and difficult day. For tens of millions of Americans who share a core belief in tolerance, decency and social justice, the election results are a severe shock. In this challenging moment, we turn to one another for comfort and community. During this election, J Street made unequivocally clear our conviction that Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States.” 
Van Jones, a CNN commentator, said that Trump's election is a nightmare, 'a deeply painful moment,” a 'whitelash” against minorities. While he bemoaned the pain inflicted upon poor little presstitute Van Jones, he didn't mind insulting the American electorate and the President-elect of the United States. After all, Van Jones sees that as his racist prerogative. Architects of Endless 'Regime Change” wars 
And so, the holier-than-thou crowd prefers Hillary, despite her unambigious position that she would maximize conflict with Russia and China, provoke direct military conflict between the US and Russia by imposing a no-fly zone in Syria, attack Iran and other of Israel's targets, further enrich her Wall Street handlers by privatizing Social Security, and prevent any dissent from the lowly people class of her high-handed ways. If William Rivers Pitt sees Trump as a Mussolini fascist, Trump is too mild for Pitt. He prefers Hillary, a Hitler to the third power. 
The progressives have totally discredited themselves just as the presstitutes have done. Their need for a bogyman to nourish their hysteria indicates serious psychological disturbance. 
They actually prefer the risk of Armageddon to peace among nuclear powers. As their 501(c)3s live off corporate contributions, they prefer globalist corporate profits to jobs for ordinary Americans. 
These are the people who think of themselves as our instructors and our betters. 
If only Trump could exile the lot of them. They are anti-American to the core. Related Posts:

Field of Valor in Orange waves thank-you to veterans ‹ › Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. After Sweeping Election, First Thing Trump Invites Netanyahu to U.S. for Meeting By VNN on November 9, 2016 To Hell With Detroit or New Orleans, Trump Calls ISRAEL to Pay Hommage to Masters! 
After sweeping the election on Tuesday, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump invited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the U.S. for a meeting. 
The two spoke on the phone on Wednesday hours after Netanyahu congratulated Trump on his surprising win, saying Trump was a 'true friend of Israel.” According to a statement by Netanyahu, during their phone call, the two agreed to meet at the 'first opportunity.” 
Following the election results, Netanyahu published a statement congratulating Trump, saying: 'President-elect Trump is a true friend of the State of Israel. We will work together to advance the security, stability and peace in our region. The strong connection between the United States and Israel is based on shared values, shared interests and a shared destiny. 
'I'm certain that President-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between Israel and the United States, and bring it to new heights,” he added. 
This after it was disclosed earlier this month that Donald Trump was paid $ 25 million by Israeli Firster Zionist Billionaire Sheldon Adelson who fronts for AIPAC and the Zionist State. 
President Reuven Rivlin also congratulated Trump. 
'I want to congratulate President elect Donald Trump, his family, and all the American people who have once again shown the world it is the greatest democracy.” 
'I hope together Israelis and Americans can grow our innovation and cooperation, which are the fruits of liberty, and equality. God bless you, Mr. President,” Rivlin added. 
Opposition leader Isaac Herzog (Zionist Union) congratulated Trump on Facebook: 'Warm wishes to the president of the strongest and biggest global power: Donald J. Trump!” 
Habayit Hayehudi Chairman Naftali Bennett, meanwhile, hoped Trump's election would bring an end to the two-state solution. 
'Trump's victory is a tremendous opportunity for Israel to immediately announce its intention to renege on the idea of establishing Palestine in the heart of the country – a direct blow to our security and the justice of our cause. 
'This is the president-elect's outlook as it appears in his platform, and that definitely should be our way. Salient, simple and clear. The era of the Palestinian state is over.”

By Paul Craig Roberts on November 9, 2016 It seems that the oligarchs were deceived by their own media propaganda. Donald Trump has won a stunning victory over Hillary Clinton, defying Republican and Democratic political elites with his populist 'Drain the Swamp” and 'Make America Great Again” movement. 
by Paul Craig Roberts 
The US presidential election is historic, because the American people were able to defeat the oligarchs. 
Hillary Clinton, an agent for the Oligarchy, was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against Donald Trump. This shows that the media and the political establishments of the political parties no longer have credibility with the American people. 
It remains to be seen whether Trump can select and appoint a government that will serve him and his goals to restore American jobs and to establish friendly and respectful relations with Russia, China, Syria, and Iran. 
It also remains to be seen how the Oligarchy will respond to Trump's victory. Wall Street and the Federal Reserve can cause an economic crisis in order to put Trump on the defensive, and they can use the crisis to force Trump to appoint one of their own as Secretary of the Treasury. Rogue agents in the CIA and Pentagon can cause a false flag attack that would disrupt friendly relations with Russia. 
Trump could make a mistake and retain neoconservatives in his government. 
With Trump there is at least hope. Unless Trump is obstructed by bad judgment in his appointments and by obstacles put in his way, we should expect an end to Washington's orchestrated conflict with Russia, the removal of the US missiles on Russia's border with Poland and Romania, the end of the conflict in Ukraine, and the end of Washington's effort to overthrow the Syrian government. However, achievements such as these imply the defeat of the US Oligarchy. 
Although Trump defeated Hillary, the Oligarchy still exists and is still powerful. NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. 
Trump said that he no longer sees the point of NATO 25 years after the Soviet collapse. If he sticks to his view, it means a big political change in Washington's EU vassals. The hostility toward Russia of the current EU and NATO officials would have to cease. German Chancellor Merkel would have to change her spots or be replaced. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg would have to be dismissed. 
We do not know who Trump will select to serve in his government. It is likely that Trump is unfamiliar with the various possibilities and their positions on issues. It really depends on who is advising Trump and what advice they give him. 
Once we see his government, we will know whether we can be hopeful for the changes that now have a chance. 
If the oligarchy is unable to control Trump and he is actually successful in curbing the power and budget of the military/security complex and in holding the financial sector politically accountable, Trump could be assassinated. Architects of Endless 'Regime Change” Wars 
Trump said that he will put Hillary in prison. He should first put her on trial for treason and war crimes along with all of the neoconservatives. That would clear the decks for peace with the other two major nuclear powers over whom the neoconservatives seek hegemony. 
Although the neoconservatives would still have contacts in the hidden deep state, it would make it difficult for the vermin to organize false flag operations or an assassination. Rogue elements in the military/security complex could still pull off an assassination, but without neocons in the government a coverup would be more difficult. 
Trump has more understanding and insight than his opponents realize. For a man such as Trump to risk acquiring so many powerful enemies and to risk his wealth and reputation, he had to have known that the people's dissatisfaction with the ruling establishment meant he could be elected president. 
We won't know what to expect until we see who are the Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries. If it is the usual crowd, we will know Trump has been captured. 
A happy lasting result of the election is the complete discrediting of the US media. The media predicted an easy Hillary victory and even Democratic Party control of the US Senate. Even more important to the media's loss of influence and credibility, despite the vicious media attack on Trump throughout the presidential primaries and presidential campaign, the media had no effect outside the Northeast and West coasts, the stomping grounds of the One Percent. The rest of the country ignored the media. 
I did not think the Oligarchy would allow Trump to win. However, it seems that the oligarchs were deceived by their own media propaganda. Assured that Hillary was the sure winner, they were unprepared to put into effect plans to steal the election. 
Hillary is down, but not the Oligarchs. If Trump is advised to be conciliatory, to hold out his hand, and to take the establishment into his government, the American people will again be disappointed. In a country whose institutions have been so completely corrupted by the Oligarchy, it is difficult to achieve real change without bloodshed.

Dispatches from Wolf Country –Sitting in my cave, watching the spider spin ‹ › Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. After Sweeping Election, First Thing Trump Invites Netanyahu to U.S. for Meeting By VNN on November 9, 2016 To Hell With Detroit or New Orleans, Trump Calls ISRAEL to Pay Hommage to Masters! 
After sweeping the election on Tuesday, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump invited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the U.S. for a meeting. 
The two spoke on the phone on Wednesday hours after Netanyahu congratulated Trump on his surprising win, saying Trump was a 'true friend of Israel.” According to a statement by Netanyahu, during their phone call, the two agreed to meet at the 'first opportunity.” 
Following the election results, Netanyahu published a statement congratulating Trump, saying: 'President-elect Trump is a true friend of the State of Israel. We will work together to advance the security, stability and peace in our region. The strong connection between the United States and Israel is based on shared values, shared interests and a shared destiny. 
'I'm certain that President-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between Israel and the United States, and bring it to new heights,” he added. 
This after it was disclosed earlier this month that Donald Trump was paid $ 25 million by Israeli Firster Zionist Billionaire Sheldon Adelson who fronts for AIPAC and the Zionist State. 
President Reuven Rivlin also congratulated Trump. 
'I want to congratulate President elect Donald Trump, his family, and all the American people who have once again shown the world it is the greatest democracy.” 
'I hope together Israelis and Americans can grow our innovation and cooperation, which are the fruits of liberty, and equality. God bless you, Mr. President,” Rivlin added. 
Opposition leader Isaac Herzog (Zionist Union) congratulated Trump on Facebook: 'Warm wishes to the president of the strongest and biggest global power: Donald J. Trump!” 
Habayit Hayehudi Chairman Naftali Bennett, meanwhile, hoped Trump's election would bring an end to the two-state solution. 
'Trump's victory is a tremendous opportunity for Israel to immediately announce its intention to renege on the idea of establishing Palestine in the heart of the country – a direct blow to our security and the justice of our cause. 
'This is the president-elect's outlook as it appears in his platform, and that definitely should be our way. Salient, simple and clear. The era of the Palestinian state is over.”

Irwin Stovroff has received hundreds of thank-you cards since starting a nonprofit that pairs service dogs with veterans in need, but there's one letter in particular that stands out to him. 
An Army veteran named Tyson (who prefers to keep his last name private), had severe post-traumatic stress disorder, and wasn't paying much attention to his wife, Adrienne, or his children. He then welcomed a service dog named Argon into his home, and it had a profound impact. 
'When the days were so dark for Tyson, I wasn't sure if I could get through to him,” his wife wrote in a recent letter addressed to Argon. 'I am so glad you are here with us. You have brought life back into Tyson.”

By Rahul Manchanda, Esq. on November 10, 2016 There has never been a better-suited and more experienced President when it comes to these issues... 
by Rahul Manchanda, Esq. 
Now that Donald Trump has been elected President of the United States of America, there are a lot of things he needs to do. 
He has seen firsthand the unseemly underbelly of the various Deep State actors that have fought tooth and nail to both undermine and character assassinate him, as well as destroy him personally and professionally. 
But Donald Trump is made of legendary stuff, and not only endured these constant and underhanded attacks, but also exposed and destroyed them all, one by one. 
However the problems facing him and his administration still exist, and part of his mandate needs to not only 'make America great again,” but to also ensure that the cancers that plague American society are dealt with and destroyed, once and for all: 
The Media 
Donald Trump needs to somehow dismantle and break up control of the American media by only 6 major corporations. 
He needs to light a fire under the collective asses of the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC”) and force them to do their job. 
No agency in the United States is so important but has been so asleep at the wheel than this one. 
Problems with the FTC and its lack of teeth or motivation has resulted in some of the most heinous consolidations of illicit power in the hands of an evil greedy few, devastating and hurting the American people, and Donald Trump and his family as well. 
Large behemoths such as the Hillary Clinton/Deep State allies such as Google and the Major Media need to be first on the chopping/neutering block. 
The Big International Banks 
Similarly, the awesome power and monetary capital of the big banks, hedge funds, investment banking houses, and other financial institutions have also been left to their own devices, allowed to grow like a cancer without any FTC or Treasury oversight, to the point where they literally threaten American democracy and its people on a daily basis – indeed they, just like the Major Media, got behind Hillary Clinton, even in the face of all her crimes and conspiracies, to unseat Donald Trump to ensure that he never got into Presidential Office. Hillary Clinton's Wall Street Fundraising Benefited From Loophole In Federal Anti-Corruption Rule 
This lesson Donald Trump should never forget – because as long as they are allowed to continue their domestic and global hegemony unchallenged, they will also pose an existential threat not only to the American people and their civil liberties/human rights/constitutional guarantees, but also to Donald Trump and his efficiency as President himself. 
One of his first orders of business should be the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act , previously repealed by Bill Clinton in 1998, which separates investment banking money from mom and pop checking/savings accounts, so that risky investments by banking houses will, and should, result in their bankruptcy, rather than being bailed out by the American taxpayer. 
Many argue that this repeal, coupled with the forced reduction of credit standards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by Bill Clinton through his HUD Director Andrew Cuomo to buy a home, created the mortgage crisis and crashed the American economy (some say deliberately) in 2008. Goldman Sachs sickeningly created a reverse credit swap derivative, betting on the impending housing mortgage crisis, and made billions in the Glass-Steagall repeal that was pushed by their own Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, and Gene Sperling, when they were US Treasury Secretaries and Economic Policy Advisors under Bill Clinton. RUBIN, GREENSCAM, AND SUMMERS 
Donald Trump also needs to take on the Federal Reserve, audit them, and if he finds any irregularities or shady behavior (which he most assuredly will), then he needs to immediately repudiate and/or renegotiate the insanely ridiculous 23 Trillion Dollars in American Debt, delivering the American People from the yoke of financial and tax slavery by the Central Bankers of America, Europe, and Overseas. 
Optimally he might consider issuing American currency from the US Government, rather than by a secret closed-off cabal of illicit and greedy private international citizens/corporations. President Bill Clinton promotes NAFTA at the United States Chamber of Commerce in November, 1993. 
Bring Industry and Manufacturing Jobs Back to the USA 
As Donald Trump so effectively and succinctly repeated while on the campaign trail over the past 2 years, the North American Free Trade Agreement ('NAFTA”) was single-handedly one of the most devastating and disruptive treaties ever placed on the books of American jurisprudence, thus resulting in the mass loss of tens of millions of American jobs, industries, manufacturing facilities, revenue, and self-confidence of the American people – 
Donald Trump needs to rebuild and re-establish American pre-eminence in industry, manufacturing, and hardcore goods for services, all made and manufactured in the United States of America. 
Stupid Foreign Wars 
Donald Trump has also echoed the American overwhelming cry of anti Neo-Conservative bloodlust by keeping America out of stupid, foreign wars geared only for the benefit and power of a few, endangering the safety and welfare of the many. 
To do this Donald Trump must revamp and refresh the US Department of Defense, the Pentagon, the Intelligence Services, and the Military. 
He must ensure that not one single drop of American blood be shed for another hopelessly stupid war – if the United States has become a National Security State with its greatest source of income and revenue being the weapons, artillery, and products of the Military Industrial Complex ('MIC”) then he needs to find alternative and supplemental sources of revenue such as what was described above in terms of manufacturing and industrial jobs and factories being re-established within the United States. Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery Offers Tragic Testimony to America's Most Recent Wars 
Donald Trump needs to value the heroism and self-sacrifice of American soldiers, military and veterans, and stop sending them on unnecessary stupid wars for the sake of the wealth and power of the Deep State, and also to ensure that once our soldiers return home, that they are treated like the true heroes and privileged class that they are, and always should be (jobs, health care, benefits, and utmost respect). 
No one has better described the predicament facing the American People in this regard than Dr Paul Craig Roberts in his stellar work, 'The Neoconservative Threat to World Order.” 
This also means developing working and effective relationships with other great world powers such as Russia, China, and India, in the spirit of mutual respect and friendship, to jointly take on the world's problems and terrorists together, based on mutual consultation and consensus, rather than with the United States 'policing the entire world.” 
Reversing Divide and Conquer 
One of the first things that Donald Trump said upon accepting his election as President was that he wanted to listen to everyone, and bring everyone together under the fabric of the United States of America. 
Right off the bat, he declared that he would be a uniter, and not a divider. 
To that end he needs to now undo the 'special protected classes,” chock full of con-artists and whiners who use their protected class status to get special privileges, abuse others, trample on the right of others not lucky enough to be different, or oppress the constitutional, civil, and human rights of the rest of America. From undermining the Second Amendment and influencing elections to sponsoring color revolutions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, the ominous footprint of George Soros is everywhere.— reclaimourrepublic 
These protected classes have been revealed to be the 'henchmen” and agents of the Deep State, by the likes of such men as arch-manipulator and 'color revolution” social engineer, George Soros, who use these unwitting 'protected classes” to do their dirty work, in their ongoing assault on the American people with their 'divide and conquer” rhetoric, pitting men against women, children against their own parents, gays against straights, minorities against majorities, and different races/religions against one another. 
The only ones who benefit from this intra-American infighting have always been the Ruling Class Deep State Plutocrat Elite, who have watched with smiles, rubbing their hands, as they kept the American people fighting amongst themselves, so that the People are too busy fighting and killing each other to notice or challenge the crimes and conspiracies of the Deep State Elite themselves. 
Criminal Justice and Family Court Reform 
No single 'American Industry” has been so lucrative to the Deep State Elite, and debilitating to the American People, than the horrific butchering process known as the American Criminal Justice and Family Court system – indeed many would argue that the dismal state of race relations in America have their origins in the disparate treatment of racial and religious minorities by the state-sanctioned and wholesale criminality of the American Police State as implemented by Bill Clinton and Joseph Biden's Crime Bill of 1994 and its corresponding draconian legislation pertaining to the family and criminal courts and its privatized prison industrial complex. Surrounded by lawmakers, President Bill Clinton hugs then-Sen. Joseph Biden after signing the $30 billion crime bill at the White House on Sept. 13, 1994. Dennis Cook/AP 
All too often, fundamental constitutional rights and guarantees have been squelched and squashed by the 'American Stasi ” as formulated by the 1994 Crime Bill, and its corresponding US Department of Justice state-sanctioned 'Community Oriented Policing” gang-stalking program, resulting in 1/3 of all African-Americans, 1/6 of all Latinos, and 1/10 of all Whites having been unfairly and without due process, probable cause, or evidence arrested, incarcerated, with families destroyed, resulting in over 70 million Americans with permanent criminal records (more than the entire population of France) – something is wrong here, and Donald Trump needs to do something about the fact that Biden and Clinton et al have transformed our once great and proud country into a 'Nation of Criminals.” 
Donald Trump needs to take the immediate measures and remedies to undo and reverse the American Police State as described by John Whitehead in his seminal book and treatise, 'Battlefield America.” 
Foreign Relations 
As Donald Trump echoed while on the campaign trail, he is a subscriber to the Thomas Jefferson school of thought of 'Peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations – entangling alliances with none.” I am sometimes asked if I have any regrets about publishing our book. As of today, my only regret is that it is not being published now. After the humiliations that Obama has endured at the hands of the Israel Lobby and the Hagel circus, we would sell even more copies and we would not face nearly as much ill-informed criticism. — Stephen Walt, co-author of the book. 
Donald Trump is an 'America-Firster,” and will not allow the United States to get embroiled and enmeshed in unnecessary foreign stupid wars, treaties, and other entanglements which tend to negatively affect American sovereignty, weighing us down like a rock around our collective necks – foreign nations need to put their 'big boy pants” on and deal with their own internal skirmishes, civil wars, financial problems, and other internecine conflicts on their own, without the constant hand-holding (and financial and military support) of the United States and its hard working taxpayers. 
Unless the sovereignty or security of the United States is directly at risk, the USA needs to stay the hell out of the worlds' problems and to focus on our own people, economy, and issues. 
The sentiments echoed herein can be attributed to legendary libertarian statesmen such as Dr Ron Paul and his protege Daniel McAdams. 
Re-injecting and Reinforcing American Moral Standards 
No area of American life has been so undermined and impacted as the deterioration of fundamental American values, morals, and character in the past few decades of American society, disastrously affecting American individuals, families, cities, states, and eventually the nation itself. 
This has been augmented and exacerbated by the constant, irresponsible, and disgusting messages in the American media, movie industry, Hollywood, by the undermining of organized religion in America, and the disruption of common value systems as brought on by unregulated mass immigration and non-assimilation by various foreign elements. 
A nation's moral health and compass is absolutely essential for it to be considered a 'Shining City on a Hill” as described by legendary President Ronald Reagan himself. 
For this, Donald Trump must use his 'bully pulpit” as a leader to identify, isolate, target, and then take on the purveyors of common filth and disrepute by the American Hollywood movie and television industry, media, and other enemies of common human decency and morality. 
American Infrastructure 
As Donald Trump is the ultimate and consummate 'builder,” it will be awe-inspiring to watch him re-build American infrastructure, such as our railroads, transportation systems, airports, roads and highways, hospitals, schools, buildings and cities. 
There has never been a better-suited and more experienced President when it comes to these issues, and Donald Trump will not disappoint in this very important arena of America's pride, patriotism, self-confidence, and self-respect. Incumbent Attorney General Loretta Lynch 
Cleanse The Judiciary 
It is no secret that the last 8 years of steady Obama appointments have stocked the American Judiciary, federal state and local, with either Deep State bankster agents, or their 'protected class” useful idiot appointees, who all report back to the same Deep State Oligarchy/Plutocracy anyway. 
The only thing these appointees have in common is that they generally have no respect for or understanding of the US Constitution or the Bill of Rights. 
The direct Deep State judicial appointees, usually hailing from the big law firms who in turn represent the big banks/corporations, know exactly who their masters are, while the ambitious 'protected class” judicial appointees are either imbalanced activists, or too stupid to realize that their biased, unconstitutional judicial opinions serve the same Deep State Elite anyway, as they help to eviscerate and destroy the protections afforded and guaranteed by the US Constitution. 
Either way, a major house cleaning is in order, and Donald Trump needs to re-stock the judiciary with learned, educated, and constitutionally minded judges in the federal and state courts all throughout America, beginning with the major cities first, 'pruning the judicial tree” as he goes along.

  President-Elect Donald Trump must ensure continued efforts toward a Palestinian state   
WASHINGTON DC – The American Muslims for Palestine , a national education organization advocating for Palestinian human rights, expresses deep concern over President-Elect Trump's potential plans for U.S. policy in the Middle East. Though it is still unclear what Mr. Trump will do as president, AMP's concerns stem from comments and promises he made during his campaign. 
Specifically, AMP asserts the status of Jerusalem has not been resolved and supports Palestinians' rights to Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. AMP rejects the promises Mr. Trump made to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September to declare Jerusalem as the 'undivided capital of Israel.” AMP strongly opposes moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and also is deeply troubled by comments suggesting a Trump administration would forgo the idea of a Palestinian state. 
If Mr. Trump follows up on his campaign promises, it would be a departure from the position of previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike, which always understood such actions would undermine U.S credibility and influence throughout the world in general, and in the Middle East in particular. 
Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett said yesterday the notion of a Palestinian state would not have to be considered under Trump's administration. 'Trump's victory is an opportunity for Israel to immediately retract the notion of a Palestinian state in the center of the country, which would hurt our security and just cause. … This is the position of the president-elect… The era of a Palestinian state is over,” Bennett was quoted as saying. 
'At the beginning of his candidacy, Mr. Trump insisted he would be even-handed in his dealings with the Palestinians and Israelis,” said Dr. Osama Abuirshaid, expert analyst and national director of policy for AMP. 'We already are in a weakened position in the Middle East because of some current U.S. policies. Mr. Trump's promises are not in the best interest of the United States.” 
He added, 'If Mr. Trump's promises were to be implemented, it could hurt our stance throughout the world. They certainly would not have the backing of our global partners and could hurt our national security.” 
AMP continues to call for an end to Israel's military occupation of Palestine, including its 10-year siege on the Gaza Strip. 
'We hope the Trump administration will be open to working to ensure justice for everyone in the Middle East,” Abuirshaid said. 'Barring that, we will continue during the next four years to build our base among progressive elements in society, as well with those who work on social justice issues in the interfaith community and communities of color. AMP will continue to advocate for Palestinian human rights by providing accurate information and through contextualizing the Palestinian struggle as one that is just and in accordance with international humanitarian law and international law.” Related Posts:

  How You Can Support and Honor Our Veterans on Veterans Day   Here are a few simple ways you can help make a difference on Veterans Day for our 23 million veterans 
November 11th is Veterans Day, a day to remember, reflect and honor the sacrifices that our service men and women have made to protect our country's freedom. It's important to acknowledge and thank our veterans not only on this day, but whenever the opportunity arises for their willingness to put their lives on the line for the common good. 
While our veterans may have fought in different battles throughout different eras, they all share the common experience of training, combating, and a life that is ever changing once they return from war with more than their duffle bags and dog tags. According to the National Association of Mental Health, nearly one in four veterans showed signs of mental illness conditions, such as PTSD, TBI or depression. For other veterans, learning how to live with the loss of a limb or immobility can be a long journey. 
Here are a few simple ways you can help make a difference on Veterans Day for our 23 million veterans Volunteer with DAV – Disabled American Veterans is a non-profit charity organization dedicated to providing support to American veterans and their families. Volunteer with DAV and make a difference in the lives of our nation's heroes by driving veterans to appointments, participating in recreational programs or simply providing companionship to VA hospital patients. Understand Veteran Mental Health Issues – According to a recent study by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, on average 22 veterans take their own lives each day. In addition, 1 in 5 people who commit suicide daily are veterans. Depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are the two most common challenges faced by veterans after returning to civilian life. Many of our veterans are suffering in silence, which is why they need our support. Connect with Veterans in Your Community- Social support for veterans from organizations such as VFW, American Legion and others in your local community can be strong factors against suicide. Reach out to these and other veterans organizations in your community to find out how you can help. When veterans feel connected to a community or has people to turn to, they are less likely to commit suicide. Know the Warning Signs of Depression – Signs of depression include prolonged sadness or irritability, changes in sleep, appetite, energy, problems with memory and concentration, and increased alcohol consumption or substance abuse. One resource that is available 24/7 is the National Veterans Crisis Line (1-800-273-8255) Sponsor a Companion Dog – More than a third of our veterans have or will experience PTSD from their time in the service. Puppies Behind Bars is a unique program which utilizes prisoners to train companion dogs for veterans suffering from PTSD. By sponsoring a dog or donating, you can help improve the life of a veteran. Send a Letter or Package- Operation Gratitude send 200,000+ care packages and hand-written letters to Veterans, Active Duty, Wounded Warriors and their caregivers yearly. Their mission is to lift the spirits and meet the needs of the military community, while providing volunteer opportunities for civilians to express their gratitude to all who have served. Find out how you can donate or get involved here . Simply Say Thank You- The simplest gesture you can do to make an impact in the lives of a veteran is simply say 'thank you for your service.” While it hardly takes any effort, many veterans have never heard the words. If you know a veteran or pass by someone in uniform, say 'Thanks!” It may make his or her day. 
It's important to find ways to get involved and show your appreciation to our veterans not just on November 11th but every day. Through understanding their mental health, offering companionship, assisting them with daily tasks or simply saying thank you, you can make a difference in their lives.

By dan elliott 
The Department of Veterans Affairs has warned more than 2,100 veterans in Eastern Colorado and parts of Kansas that their personal information may have been compromised when an employee emailed documents to himself. 
An agency employee told The Associated Press that he is the person who emailed the information to himself, describing it as unauthorized wait lists used by VA health care facilities in Colorado. The employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he fears retaliation, said he wanted to document the lists because they could have been used to conceal lengthy delays in providing care. 
In Wednesday's warning to veterans, the VA said the potentially compromised information included veterans' full names, the last four digits of their Social Security numbers and medical diagnoses. The agency said the employee emailed it to himself in unencrypted form.

Buckle up because this blog is about to get 'bumpy”. Upon moving through the news today I stumbled upon an article which stated that Trump won the Catholic vote. The article continued on relaying that 45% of those (self-identified) 'Catholics” polled voted for Clinton? Yes, you heard me right. Nearly one out of every two people polled voted for the high ranking satanic witch herself. It truly is a sad time to be a Catholic. The good news, of course, is that, those who did identify themselves as 'Catholic” are not in reality. Today we live in a cesspool of heresy and apostasy. I couldn't imagine the remarks of some of the Church Fathers if they had lived in our time. Make no mistake I hold that Trump is a New World Order puppet but at least he is pretending not to be Satan. My goodness how low society has hit when self-professed Catholics vote for a satanic pedophile. Fifty percent of supposed 'Catholics” voted for death itself and did these same 50 percenter's forget their way home from the voting machines as well? 
It is truly not surprising. Take a look at what is going on the Vatican and you have your answer. From the top on down it is nearly wholly corrupt. The Synagogue has the highest seat now in the Vatican and has puppets/agents spread throughout all the world governments. Folks, voting for evil will not get rid of evil. Only God now can cure us of this disease in the Vatican and in Washington D.C. Stupid is as stupid does and when the supposed leader of the Church goes around making such idiotic statements which run contrary to the Faith the stupidity only tends to grow. I am certain that these Clinton supporters no longer have any fear of God by demonstrating their support for her. Lebron James the 'Christian” (Illuminati puppet) even came out and supported her. 
The Church was meant to be the salt of the world. The statistics show that Obama won the 'Catholic” vote back in 2012 so at least we had a drop in 5 percent over the last 4 years. I could not be any more sarcastic. This number should not even be one percent! In my most recent poll on TradCatKnight (which closed yesterday) I had 2 percent of the viewing audience say they would vote for Clinton. What in the hell is wrong with people these days? Is it the 'chemtrail nanobots” activating inside the heads of men telling them to go vote for Satan? Is it the fluoride in the water which is specifically targeting the 'Catholic” population alone? Or maybe just maybe it is the Marxist/Socialists who have hijacked our Church? Since Vatican II the Church has been overrun with heresy which is now being labeled truth. Hey…but they got to get with the times! Churchmen have completely lost their minds because they have lost God's grace. Their hearts are ill and thus their minds rot and vice versa. Churchmen of the Conciliar Church (Vatican II) no longer are the salt but they are sugar. They are too busy trying to sugar coat everything and kiss up to the world. Some 'Catholics” on their way home? 
It must have been those Ouija board playing 'Catholics”. Apparently, 50% percent of these supposed Catholics missed that part in the Church's teaching on voting for pro-choice politicians. Or did they? Have we arrived at that point in history where those claiming to follow Christ no longer even care about the basics? And if so how does this not indicate that Antichrist is right around the corner? Truly, a sign for our times. My good friends, I would argue that nine out of every ten 'Catholic” isn't Catholic these days due to this apostasy in the Church. These heretics showing up to vote are no more Catholic than Stephen Hawking is. Seriously, what Catechism do these 'Catholics” read besides their Maxim magazine and Sports Illustrated (modern man's new catechism). It truly is sad and frightening what I have to encounter out in 'internet land” on a daily basis in regards to who labels themselves 'Catholic”. Is there any hope with error so widespread? On the human level there is not which is why God will soon chastise this world like it has never seen. Men will see (they will wish they hadn't) God's distaste for liberalism, Marxism, Socialism, Americanism, Communism, Protestantism, Zionism, etc. Buckle up it is going to get bumpy. 
We all know we live in apocalyptic times, however, does it get any more apocalyptic than 'Catholics” voting for Killery? Forget about that asteroid coming to end society for society is already lost and gone. As the Church goes so will the world and this perfectly summarizes where we are in terms of the times we live in. It is hard enough these days to try and convert those outside the true Catholic Faith and now I have to deal with this argument (that nearly half voted for Hillary). Again, this is not to say that Trump is not evil either. The reason people believe he is not evil is simply a distorted perception of him. What you see of him (in the mainstream media) is how the new world order wants you to perceive him. This 'branding” will only make it easier to institute the race war and riots they have planned from the backlash of his election. 
When will the voters realize the game has been rigged? Heck, even Hitler was funded by the Zionists and that was ancient history. You think it is any different now? The answer is the New World Order loves and wants the division they have created since this election and they plan on taking full advantage of it. Then, of course, the new world order will use this division to further solidify the One World Religion coming. The same principles for marriage ought to be applied for voting. Do you just settle? Do you continually make your bed with these puppeteers of the new world order? Can you imagine if you actually convinced yourself to marry the lesser of two evils? When will men await the arrival of the eagles? I have been saying for some time now 'pray for the best but prepare for the worst” yet too many ride upon that 'high of false hope” as this four year roller coaster keeps passing by. Will there be an outpouring of prayer out to God for real leaders (who are really outsiders) who will truly lead men through the Great Storm to come. It assuredly isn't Trump nor Clinton because both who cash checks from the snakes head called 'Israel.inc”. 
P-R-S Model (Problem, Reaction & Solution) The Problem= Hillary Clinton Reaction= Need change, an 'outsider”= Donald Trump (supposed Outsider) Solution= division and civil unrest (which ultimately leads toward a wanting of a 'messiah” figure to come)
