Email Print Democratic Vice President Joe Biden wants American women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy. 'If we just put all the women back to work, if they were able to afford childcare, we would increase the GDP in America by close to eight tenths of one percent,' he said. 'That's trillions of dollars over the next decade.' Biden made his remarks during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Tuesday. 'The state of our economy could be characterized by a single word: pitiful,' he argued. 'We're still battling recession, I don't care what the official stats are saying, America is still in recession. And we're not doing anything about it.' He added that it was 'lazy American women' who brought about the downfall of the economy, because 'they sit around on their behinds, doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them.' 'I'm not sure how exactly we got to this point, but we're here and we need to move. Like, yesterday,' he said. 'Mark my words and mark them well,' he addressed the crowd. 'Hillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work. This is true because of a number of reasons. First, she's a woman herself and not just any woman; she's a self-made woman. So you better believe what she's saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times.' 'Second, Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a free-loader when your husband is the bread-winner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house, the children, make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties. She's been all that and she's learned how to break free from it, the hard way, I might add,' Biden continued. 'Today's women are pampered and aren't used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own,' the vice president said. 'They're too dependent, too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy. The reason for that is they've learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics: when a sought-after commodity becomes short in supply, the demand for it rises even higher.' 'Now, that's all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests, but if you look at the big picture, it's the economy that's missing out on valuable workforce. And that's why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces. And like I said, Hillary Clinton is the only one who can do it, which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next President of the United States. We need to heal this country, folks, not run it into the ground even deeper,' Biden concluded. Join us on Facebook to Stop The Takeover. Click on the button to subscribe.

Email Print It's no secret that Obama and his puppets are doing everything they possibly can to rig the election against Trump. Positive Trump polls are coming all the time, so it's all hands on deck from the Democrats to do whatever it takes to hand the election to Hillary. Obama's latest move involves registering immigrant voters who will most likely be voting for Hillary in November and he's spent TONS of your taxpayer money doing it. From Judicial Watch : Months after the Obama administration spent $19 million to register new immigrant voters that will likely support Democrats in November, it's dedicating an additional $10 million in a final push as the presidential election approaches. The money is distributed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Homeland Security agency that oversees lawful immigration, to organizations that help enhance pathways to naturalization by offering immigrants free citizenship instruction, English, U.S. history and civics courses. Officially, they're known as 'citizenship integration grants.'['¦] Judicial Watch went on to say'¦ The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been aggressive in promoting its citizen integration grant program this year, offering large sums to recruit new groups that can offer immigrants the services they need to become citizens. Clearly, the ultimate goal is qualifying as many immigrants as possible to vote since they tend to cast ballots for Democrats. 'We intend to award about $1 million to first-time recipients in the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program for fiscal year 2016,' the agency's grant announcement states. 'If you represent one of these organizations, or know of an interested organization, we strongly encourage that organization to consider applying. Additionally, another $9 million will fund programs that provide both citizenship instruction and instruction and naturalization application services.' Some might consider this a cash giveaway.['¦] Practically every federal agency is participating in the effort by contributing resources and creating programs to help immigrants. For example the Department of Labor (DOL) is implementing 'new workforce programs' for the 'new Americans' and the Department of Education is promoting 'funding opportunities' to assure that the immigrants 'are provided the tools they need to succeed.' The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is collaborating with other agencies to release a career and credentialing toolkit on 'immigrant-focused career-pathways programs.' The Department of Justice (DOJ) and USCIS are making sure the new Americans have worker rights and protections and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is launching a two-year pilot to assure that non English speakers have 'meaningful access to housing programs' subsidized by American taxpayers. Obama likes to pretend that he's doing this for the greater good of America, but the truth is it's just part of the overall agenda to do whatever it takes to make sure Democrats run Washington and continue to drive our country into the ground.

Email Print The Democrats have become synonymous with the word scandal in this election. We have yet another scandal and reason to distrust Obama and Hillary Clinton'”just for you. President Obama's Justice Department has been caught red handed stealing money, which should be going to victims of crimes, and putting it into the hands of left-wing advocacy groups, as per Breitbart . This new scandal comes after we saw Hillary Clinton cleared of charges for acid washing her emails. This clearance came from the Justice Department, as run by a person who had private meetings with Bill Clinton prior to the decision. This also happened after Hillary Clinton said that if she was elected, she would reappoint the current attorney general'”that same person'”Loretta Lynch. The key facts of this news scandal are as follows: the Justice Department has millions of dollars of taxpayer money that is usually reserved for the victims of serious crimes. However, Obama has been funneling money, in the ballpark of $650 million, away from victims of serious crimes and towards organizations that are helping him. This money is supposed to be going to victims of federal crimes like gang violence, wall street corruption, or other white collar crimes. It's normally used for restitution of the money the victims lost as a result of criminal actions. Is it surprising Obama thinks this money should be lining his pockets instead? Obama and his cronies find ways to make these left wing advocacy groups 'victims' of crimes. These are organizations are signing people up to vote, going to rallies, knocking on doors, and helping elect Hillary Clinton'”not advocacy groups that need restitution of money lost to criminals. Obama's Justice Department has failed us once again. Instead of abusing taxpayer money, this Justice Department should be prosecuting Hillary Clinton for lying to Congress, destroying evidence after receiving a congressional subpoena, and obstructing justice. This is, alone, is enough to impeach the president, but we all know there simply isn't enough time left in his presidency to do so. But, maybe we could get the paperwork rolling just to scare him a little bit! If elected, it is clear Hillary Clinton will continue these corrupt practices, especially with Loretta Lynch as her attorney general. The Justice Department especially will remain a pay-to-getaway operation. Do you think Obama's scheme of funneling money is ethical?

Email Print You know Hillary Clinton is getting desperate when she begins resorting to cheap tricks like this one'¦ As you already know, yesterday the FBI announced that they will be reopening the Clinton email investigation following the discovery of new emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop that Hillary thought she had deleted. Well, as a last ditch effort to try and save her career, President Obama stepped in last minute and Ordered Attorney General Loretta Lynch to tell Comey to back off and not release the information to the public! You see, technically Loretta Lynch is in charge of the FBI by being attorney general. She approached Comey directly when she learned about the information and ordered him to stand down, saying he was violating Department of Justice policy. According to her, it would 'interfere with the election.' James Comey, however, was apparently sick and tired of being bossed around. He stared back at her and declared that he had a duty to Congress and the American people to let them know what is REALLY going on. Comey said, 'I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.' So thank you, FBI Director Comey, for finally growing a pair and standing up to the Hillary Clinton and Obama machine. Now the American people know the TRUTH about Hillary Clinton, and that will end her reign of terror. If you want to show Comey your support, then share this out so everyone can see that the man is a hero just in case Obama uses some dirty trick to try and sabotage him too'¦ Join us on Facebook to Stop The Takeover.

Email Print One of my top candidates for Attorney General just gave Hillary Clinton a little truth bomb for dinner. While appearing with Megyn Kelly and discussing the reopening of the FBI investigation against Hillary Clinton, Gowdy said Hillary's attitude and defensiveness is ''¦just too rich.' In essence, she is getting exactly what she deserves'¦ Gowdy stated something I commented on earlier in the day, stating, 'The same person who went to great lengths to make sure that these emails were private now, all of a sudden, wants it all made public.' This is grandstanding by Hillary, nothing more. As an attorney, and as Secretary of State, Hillary knows the FBI CAN NOT release any information about an ongoing investigation. She also knows that due to the complexity of the case, it could take months before We the People hear anything from the FBI about this investigation. This is nothing Comey is doing to hurt her in the campaign or any type of conspiracy, this is just how the system works. The arrogance of Clinton is now demanding we get that information immediately, which would mean expediting her case and devoting thousands of extra man hours, probably all overtime, at tax payers expense! That, my friends, is what we would call privilege. And I don't want to hear her argument that because she is running for president she is entitled because We the People were also supposed to be entitled to a Secretary of State that was not corrupt! Hilary wrote this narrative on her own. She decided to use a private server for government communications, something NOBODY else in our government was doing or was allowed to do. She broke the rules, and now that there is an attempt to hold her accountable for it, she wants exceptions. Gowdy is right, this is rich, because if Hillary had simply followed the rules, she would not be in this mess in the first place! But, then again, there is a reason we have jails'¦ because criminals never follow the rules! And Mr. Gowdy, if Hillary truly gets what she deserves, her address will be changed to one of those prisons very soon!

According to Conservative Daily Post: Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton are the founders of ISIS. We have proven that through emails and documents leaked from WikiLeaks, but liberal media outlets still refuse to cover it. After all, they are still more focused on what Trump said eleven years ago than what Hillary has actually done. Because of brave patriots like Julian Assange, we have been given more evidence that Hillary Clinton is more connected to ISIS than we originally believed. An email was leaked between Clinton and John Podesta indicating that: 'Western intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region' to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of 'providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.' Citing the need to 'use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets,' said Hillary to Podesta while arguing the current developments in the Middle East were 'important to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country.' Odd that Clinton argues Saudi Arabia and Qatar are helping fund ISIS when Hillary's largest donations come from those two countries. In another correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai, set up a meeting with Bill Clinton for five minutes in exchange for a $1,000,000 'birthday check.' The email adds that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would 'welcome [the Clinton Foundation's] suggestions for investments in Haiti '” particularly on education and health.' Desai added that while Qatar had already 'allocated most of their $20 million '¦ [they were] happy to consider projects we suggest.' Bill Clinton gets $1M from Qatar for his birthday. FYI: It's legal and common practice in Qatar for husbands to beat and rape their wives. pic.twitter.com/oGM2Z9JrVl 
'” Martin Walsh (@mrwalsh8) October 13, 2016 We now see two more examples of the Clinton's acting corrupt and being intertwined with nations that fund ISIS. For those that do not see where the dots connect, let's simplify how this all worked for Hillary. Hillary, as Secretary of State, would sell terrorist nations large weapons deals only after they gave her a very generous donation to her 'foundation.' These weapons, provided by Hillary and her State Department, then filtered down from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Libya, and so on to create, supply, and bolster terrorist groups. That is exactly how ISIS was created. But instead of blowing them up with an air assault, Hillary and Obama decided to leave ISIS alone. Why? Because ISIS being in the Middle East allows the Obama/Clinton machine to make millions in personal profits from these nations in a repetitive cycle of selling weapons. They are choosing personal gain over eliminating a terrorist group. Let that sink in. Why else have they not arrested Hillary for all of these crimes? The FBI would arrest you in a heartbeat if you went to Facebook right now to praise Allah and ISIS. It also speaks volumes as to why they are trying so hard to silence Julian Assange. If Julian Assange is lying, why are they trying so hard to silence him? 
'” Martin Walsh (@mrwalsh8) October 23, 2016 The media remains silent on all of this. This would be plastered all over the news for months if a President Trump was exposed for this. Ignorant politicians are not the problem. The problem is that ignorant people keep voting for them every election. This is the exact reason we desperately need change in this country, and it starts with Donald Trump. People like Julian Assange have given up their lives to expose corruption in government and allowing Hillary Clinton to win this election makes all of his sacrifices meaningless. He has offered us a chance to revolt against our tyrannical government. Chances likes this do not occur often, and if we do not seize the opportunity, we will suffer another four years of suppression from our corrupt leaders. Vote Trump, so that we can save America and he can pardon Julian Assange. Yes America, after all of this, how can you vote for Hillary or stay at home on election day?! How could you?!

Email Print It would appear as though conservatives have had enough of the liberals dumping on our HQ's around the country, so they decided to dump a little something on one of theirs! USA Today reports that in the early morning hours of Saturday, the Warren County, Ohio, Democrat Headquarters received a 'gift' from an anonymous donor. Of course, the idea of a 'gift' is always in the eyes of the receiver. Where a farmer would have been grateful for the donation, Democrat leadership was less than thrilled with it. The gift in question: a truckload of manure. Some would view this delivery as a 'redistribution of wealth' '“ a truckload of manure isn't necessarily cheap. Others may see it as the public giving back what Democrats have been shoveling out for the last eight years. While this 'donation' is being categorized as an act of vandalism, you can't help but believe that the police officers who took the call on this 'contribution' had a stifled chuckle about it. There is a humorous aspect to this social commentary. 'What reasonable person thinks this is OK?' Democrat Party Chair Bethe Goldenfield said in a post on social media. 'I won't be responding to anyone who thinks this is acceptable behavior. It is illegal !' The same thing happened in 2012, Goldenfield noted. Evidently, Ms. Goldenfield doesn't appreciate the subtlety of the humor and/or the karma involved. One could argue that 'what goes around comes around.' Warren County is a suburban Cincinnati county that overwhelmingly votes Republican. Mitt Romney garnered 69 percent of the vote in 2012. In fact, it's been close to 40 years since a Democrat was elected to even a countywide office. In response to the news, the chairman of the Warren County Republican Party said the GOP had nothing to do with the manure. In an act of good faith, he extended access to organization volunteers 'to help clean things up.' That is a far cry from anything Democrats have offered in the aftermath of much more serious incidents at Republican headquarters in North Carolina and Indiana. In North Carolina, someone firebombed the Orange County GOP headquarters. In that incident, graffiti was scrawled on the side of the building warning the Republican 'Nazis' to leave the county or else. In Indiana, someone tossed a brick through the window of one local Republican headquarters. Both of these incidents '“ presumably executed by pro-Clinton operatives '“ caused extensive monetary damage. The 'donation in Warren County, Ohio, caused no damage and, if Ms. Goldenfield was resourceful, she could have made a profit for the organization in selling the manure to a farmer or a garden center. These examples illustrate the fundamental differences between the Left and Right side of the aisle. Where the Right makes symbolic gestures that literally hurt no one and harm nothing, the Left firebombs and destroys property. Please tell me which party is the more civilized and intellectual party? All that Progressive enlightenment hasn't amounted to much. What do you think about campaign 'contribution' that was made to the Democrat Party in Ohio?

Email Print It has been revealed that there are about 650,000 emails on Huma Abedin's husband's laptop. Of the 650,000 emails, thousands are labeled 'classified' National Security material forwarded from another email server. According to sources, the emails were discovered in a folder labeled, 'Life Insurance'. Is it possible the folder was mislabeled by Abedin to deliberately conceal its contents? This also begs the question: How did Huma Abedin get National Security clearance? 
The NY Post explains where FBI originally dropped the ball when they first investigated Abedin: Skeptical agents showed Abedin three separate email exchanges she had with an IT staffer regarding the operation of the private Clinton server during Clinton's tenure at State. Abedin claimed she 'did not recall' the email exchanges. So if you believe Abedin, she didn't know the private clintonemail.com server that hosted her [email protected] account even existed until she heard about it in the news. Comey was a believer; he didn't even bother to call her back for further questioning. Case closed. But Abedin's role in this caper begs for fresh scrutiny. Making false statements to a federal agent is a felony. So is mishandling classified information. By forwarding classified emails to her personal email account and printing them out at home, Abedin appears to have violated a Classified Information NonDisclosure Agreement she signed at the State Department on Jan. 30, 2009, in which she agreed to keep all classified material under the control of the US government. An infographic puts it in a simpler form, stating how government emails were forwarded to her Yahoo account '” for what? No one knows. There was allegedly a counter-espionage case going on around the time. With 500,000,000 email accounts hacked earlier last year, Abedin has put our National Security in danger.

Email Print In the summer of 2013, Hillary Clinton had just left the State Department and returned to New York. She was determined to latch on to her high approval ratings and lay the foundation for a second presidential run. That's when Anthony D. Weiner happened. The husband of Clinton's closest aide, Huma Abedin, was running for mayor of New York when it was revealed that he had continued to exchange lewd messages with women online even after the practice cost him his congressional seat. The incident brought Abedin's relationship with Clinton into the spotlight, and Clinton was once again making headlines for sexual indiscretions. Now, just weeks away from the election, Weiner has pulled her into yet another one of his dramas. Federal investigators are looking into his sexual messaging with an underage girls, and they just happened to stumble across thousands of emails that are potentially pertinent to the FBI investigation of Clinton's private email server. This was disturbing for many reasons. Americans are not happy that the Clintons have a continued behavior of standing behind those who have committed dangerous sexual or financial acts. That doesn't align well with Hillary's message about empowering women. In fact, many of Clinton's friends have suggested she distance herself from Abedin. Still, she kept Abedin close by her side as she prepared to make a statement about the new revelation to the media. 'We of course stand by her,' her campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, said on Saturday when he was asked whether Abedin would step down. The question on many Americans' minds now is whether Clinton's loyalty to Abedin would inspire her to bring her friend (and her drama) into the White House if she wins the presidency.

Email Print Sean Hannity said on his radio show Friday that he doesn't believe reports from 'The New York Times' that the FBI's latest investigation into the Clinton Foundation is related to Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner. Instead, Hannity suspects that the FBI is protecting itself because they know that WikiLeaks is about to drop proof that Hillary Clinton should have been indicted in July. 
SEAN HANNITY: If you believe The New York Times, they have a new story that just broke. 'New emails in Clinton case came from Anthony Weiner's electronic devices. Federal law enforcement officials said Friday that new emails uncovered in closed investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server discovered after the FBI seized electronic devices belonging to Huma Abedin, and aide to Mrs. Clinton, and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI told Congress that uncovered new emails.' 
Let me tell you how. I am going to say something that I know is true. This story is total bull. I don't believe this for a minute. 'Hannity, it's The New York Times.' I have no doubt the New York Times got on-the-record leaks that this is related to Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin's emails. I have no doubt '” maybe Huma didn't take a sledgehammer to her devices the way Hillary Clinton did. But this is not what resulted in the reopening of this case. No way, shape, manner, or form. They know Julian Assange '” there's too much in WikiLeaks that is coming, that has tipped them off that they're dead. That they're about to be exposed. And that is, more than anything else, this is about preservation now. 
Because James Comey, and and now we get back to'¦ this this sky Andrew McCabe who was the FBI deputy director supervising the investigation of Clinton not long after Terry McAuliffe through a PAC gave $675,000 dollars to Jo McCabe, the wife of the chief the FBI deputy Director looking into the investigation into Clinton for a long shot bid, and that $675,000 came from Hillary, who went out there and raise money for the Super PACs that McAuliffe coudl give it to her. 
The wife of the guy doing the key investigation here. Now if that doesn't impress you, I don't know what does.. 
Now let's go back to Trey Gowdy grilling James Comey. What did he say? 
Secretary Clinton said she never sent or received classified information over a private email server, is that true? 'Comey: Our investigation found there was classified information sent.' 
Stop right there. Comey is admitting a crime is committed. That raises the question why did Comey then make a determination on his own not to send this to or grand jury or special prosecutor or anybody else? In other words, the statute requires, she doesn't even have to be negligent. I'm sorry the statute requires negligence or gross negligence, yet Hillary was knowingly, purposefully, and WikiLeaks proves this, in her decisions and actions setting up a server under her control. 
Here's the question Comey has to ask: Why did you give all these people immunity?Why did you destroy evidence in the case as part of a proffered deal, why in under any circumstances do you close this case down when the evidence was overwhelming and incontrovertible and had sent numerous other people to jail for a far lesser offenses? That's called a two-tiered Justice system, that's a problem'¦ 
Hillary knowingly and purposely hurt decisions and actions set up a server under her exclusive control and possession in order to control (violate the law) in ordered to control information that was available to the American public and Congress regarding actions as Secretary of State. 
Furthermore, she took those government-owned communications into our own personal possession after leaving her position, knowingly and willingly attempted to destroy them, by the way that's obstruction of justice, violation of the law, penalty of which a minor offenses you never get a government position for the rest of your life. And was so nefarious in her actions, could never be known used as evidence'¦ 
This gets more curious day by day. Now there were reports out today that FBI agents were reportedly close to revolting over the treatment of Clinton, they're so disgusted, and every FBI special agent I know '¦ nobody has a good answer because they don't understand why organizes pretty deep 
New emails tied to discovered'“ I don't believe the New York Times, and I think the the FBI did this because they know what is coming. That's my take. Stay connected by subscribing to our news letter. Click on the button.

Email Print After writing a lengthy suicide note exposing terrifying plans the government has for American citizens, a US Customs Agent walked onto a pier in NYC and blew his brains out. Sources inside the New York City Police Department have revealed to SuperStation95, the contents of a suicide note found on the body and they are utterly frightening. The note, which says it was written over the course of a full week in advance, outlines why the officer chose to shoot himself: 'The America I grew up in, and cherished, has been murdered by its own federal government. Our Constitution has become meaningless and our laws politicized so badly, they are no longer enforced except for political purposes' the note said. 'Our elected officials are, to a person, utterly corrupt and completely devoid of any love or respect for the country which pays them. To them, everything is about getting and keeping power, and making illicit money from backroom deals.' The 42-year-old U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officer shot himself with a 40 caliber service pistol inside Pier 40 in Hudson River Park at around 11 am. (1) A source at the scene described how the officer calmly walked into the park, took out his pistol and shot himself in the head. A ICE federal agent fatally shot himself in the head at waterfront Chelsea park (pictured) in New York Friday The 42-year-old worked as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officer and his offices were nearby to the scene of the shooting. He was rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital but doctors were unable to save him. (2) ICE released a statement Friday afternoon: 'Tragically, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation officer from the New York field office suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound and has passed away.' It added: 'The agency is not releasing further details pending notification of the officer's next of kin. According to the suicide note, the Officer said: 'I was hired to enforce the law; to capture and deport people who come to this country against our laws. But now, if I dare to do that, I face being suspended or fired because our President refuses to faithfully execute the duties of his office. Instead, I come to work each day, and collect a paycheck twice a month, for intentionally doing little to nothing. I cannot and will not be party to this fraud; to this usurpation of the law, or to the despicable politicians betraying our nation' the note continued. ICE's Office of Professional Responsibility is reviewing the matter and coordinating with the New York Police Department on the investigation. The agent worked at a field office in lower Manhattan, just blocks away from the scene of the shooting. MENTIONS 'FEMA CAMPS' FOR AMERICANS (3) In the suicide note, the officer revealed what he claimed are terrifying plans the feds have been finalizing: 'If the American people knew what this government is planning, they would rise-up and overthrow it. If I or anyone else in the federal government revealed what is coming, we would be killed anyway, so now I will reveal what I know. We in federal law enforcement have been drilling for several years to control riots and uprisings from a coming financial collapse and widespread bank failures. The drills involve life-sized images of American men, even women and children, whom we are told to shoot for 'practice' and to 'get used to it.' We have been told that the economy is terminally ill and will fail in 2016. We are also told the banks are all insolvent and the FDIC doesn't have nearly enough funds to bail out depositors. We are told these events are unavoidable and it is imperative that the government survive when people rise-up over this. When the collapse takes place, detention camps created under the FEMA REX-84 program in the 1980's to house illegal aliens whom we were going to deport, will instead be used to imprison American Citizens whom the government feels constitute a 'threat.' American citizens will be rounded-up without warrants and imprisoned without trial for God knows how long. These camps have been equipped to carry out Hitler-scale killings! An actual 'purge' of Americans citizens by the very government which they, themselves, created and pay for! I cannot be party to this.' The Note goes on to say talk about state-level national guard being disarmed by the feds (4) and over 1 Billion rounds of ammunition purchased by the feds (5) and the Military over-deployed and being shrunk (6) : 'The government knows the military will rise-up to stop this, so our military is being deployed overseas, intentionally involved in foreign fights, and deliberately shrunk in size so they cannot be here or help Americans! This is why certain ammunition and weaponry has been removed from state-level National Guard Armories and over a Billion rounds of hollow point ammunition has been bought by the federal government. The states themselves have been disarmed of military-grade firepower so they cannot defend themselves from the federal activities. This is also why local police departments have been militarized and provided with armored vehicles and weapons of war' the note says. 'When the inevitable collapse begins to take place, electric power to the entire country will be shut off, as will all forms of communication. All banks will be immediately closed; no one will be able to get any money because all ATM's will be offline. Credit, Debit and EBT cards will not function. Anyone without cash will have no way to get any. The Emergency Alert System will be used to takeover all broadcast stations and tell the public this is a result of a cyber attack. But while the American people patiently await things to get back to normal, the government will unleash round-ups of citizens they deem militants or dangerous . With all civilian communications out, and all TV and radio stations taken over by the Emergency Alert System, by the time word spreads of what is taking place, the government will already have the upper hand. Federal Prisoners to be GASSED TO DEATH The note goes into a wide array of very specific plans and does so in extremely specific detail about what the feds are allegedly planning. For instance, it talks about federal prisons: 'Every federal prison has been outfitted with lethal gas systems. When things go bad, all prisoners in all prisons will be placed in their cells on lock-down. Prison staff will depart the facility, and a certain designated person will trigger a lethal gas system. All federal prisoners, regardless of their crime or their sentence, will be gassed to death in their cells. Once the gas clears, the dead will be removed and the prisons will then be used to house citizens who fight against the federal onslaught.' PRIESTS RECRUITED TO QUELL OPPOSITION (7) The note makes mention about Priests, Rabbis and Clerics from various religious denominations having been recruited and trained to quell resistance: 'So intent is the government to succeed they have recruited priests, rabbis and clerics from various religions to quote appropriate Scriptures about 'obeying government.' They are being trained to tell people not to fight back and that their best hope is to pray.' EXECUTIVE ORDER 13603 (8) The suicide note goes to great lengths about Executive Order #13603 signed by President Obama on March 16, 2012. The note details: 
Executive order 13603 about 'National Defense Resources Preparedness.' 
This 10-page document is a blueprint for a federal takeover of the economy. Specifically, Obama's plan involves seizing control of: 
* 'All commodities and products that are capable of being ingested by either human beings or animals' 
* 'All forms of energy' 
* 'All forms of civil transportation' 
* 'All usable water from all sources' 
* 'Health resources '“ drugs, biological products, medical devices, materials, facilities, health supplies, services and equipment' 
* Forced labor ( or 'induction' as the executive order delicately refers to military conscription) 
Moreover, federal officials would 'issue regulations to prioritize and allocate resources.' SuperStation95 took a look at this Executive Order from the Government Printing Office (GPO) web site and, sure enough, everything contained in the Officer's suicide note about this Executive Order is true! To be sure, much of this language has appeared in national security executive orders that previous presidents have issued periodically since the beginning of the Cold War. But more than previous national security executive orders, Obama's 13603 seems to describe a potentially totalitarian regime obsessed with control over everything. Obama's executive order makes no effort to justify the destruction of liberty, no effort to explain how amassing totalitarian control would enable government to deal effectively with cyber sabotage, suicide bombings, chemical warfare, nuclear missiles or other possible threats. There's nothing in executive order 13603 about upholding the Constitution or protecting civil liberties. In what circumstances, one might ask, would a president try to carry out this audacious plan? Executive order 13603 says with ominous ambiguity: during ' the full spectrum of emergencies .' DATABASE OF PREPPERS The suicide note touches on the subject of 'Preppers:' 'We in federal law enforcement have also been told that the government has a full database of all so-called 'Preppers.' Those people will be dealt with first '” by armed federal agents coming to take their guns, then their food stocks, so food can be re-distributed as the government sees fit.' If the dead Officer's claims about an unavoidable economic and banking collapse are true, would it then follow that the Executive Order put in place by Obama, might be activated? Would all of us find ourselves in forced labor, while the government takes OUR food and re-distrubutes it under the Executive Order's paragraph about 'allocating resources?' This is terrifying stuff! There is much more to the suicide note and SuperStation95 is considering how much more to publish. As such, this is a developing story and readers should check back for further updates. THESE COULD SIMPLY BE INSANE RAMBLINGS It is not our intent to cause panic or alarm and while we expect readers to be intelligent enough to discern this on their own, we feel compelled to point out that these could simply be paranoid ramblings of an insane person who killed himself. On the other hand, these could also be revelations by a person who was so distraught over the ugly truth, that he killed himself. We at SuperStation95 just don't know. We urge everyone to stay calm, think rationally, and decide whether or not to take any action to prepare, in case this person's suicide note is telling the truth. SOURCING / CORROBORATION

(8) Executive Order 13603 White House US Government Printing Office UPDATE '“ MAY 10, 2016 10:00 PM EDT'“ The web site SNOPES.com has issued a declaration that our story is some sort of hoax, that we are somehow NOT a radio station and attributed the story '“ and this web site '“ to a former FBI National Security Intelligence Asset named Hal Turner, whom she smears as a 'White Supremacist.' This is not the first time SNOPES.com has made accusations against us simply because we have been the exclusive source of politically-incorrect news. And while we stand-by our stories in every regard, this barrage of attacks by SNOPES.com is becoming libelous. 
We address the SNOPES.com accusations one at a time: 1) No aspect of our story above is a hoax. What Snopes.com seems to take issue with is the existence and content of a suicide note which was revealed to us by the NYPD. The person from NYPD who gave us this information did so after trying to get two other New York Media outlets, (one TV, the other a newspaper) to publish the story and was rebuked within minutes by media contacts who said 'we won't touch this with a ten foot pole.' The fact that the NYPD now claims 'no note was found' does not surprise us at all; NYPD has very close ties with the feds and the feds have an intense interest in concealing or discrediting the information it contained. 2) According to the FCC Licensing Bureau, 95.1 FM in New York City is the HD-4 frequency for WNSH 94.7 FM as licensed by the FCC as shown HERE 3) Our story was written by our News Room staff, not anyone named Hal Turner. 4) Mr. Turner was formerly a paying customer of this radio station from October 7, 2015 thru March 30, 2016. He bought air time from us to air his personal radio show 'The Hal Turner Show.' Finances caused Mr. Turner to cancel his programming on our radio station and continue his show on WBCQ International Shortwave , where he is on the air live from 9-11 PM every Wednesday evening. Mr. Turner's web site is: HalTurnerShow.com . He is welcome to return to our airwaves if his finances improve. 5) SNOPES.com claims Mr. Turner is a 'white supremacist.' In reality Mr. Turner worked for the FBI from 1993 '“ 2008, with his TOD as the Joint Terrorism Task Force from 2003-2008. His job was to infiltrate white supremacist groups to thwart violent criminal acts by such persons. This information came out when the Obama Administration betrayed Mr. Turner in 2009 and arrested him for writing in 2009, what the government PAID HIM $3,000 TO SAY on DATELINE NBC and FOX NEWS CHANNEL just four years earlier in 2005! After three trials (two hung juries) Mr. Turner was Bankrupted by legal fees, was appointed a public defender, who threw the case, resulting in Mr. Turner's conviction. For SNOPES.com to smear Mr. Turner as a 'White Supremacist' when federal court records show the exact opposite, is a prime example of the utterly shoddy research and reporting provided by SNOPES.com

Email Print Hillary Clinton got the shock of her life on Friday when the FBI reopened their investigation into her use of a personal email server during her time as Secretary of State. The investigation was reopened due to incriminating emails found on the server of Anthony Weiner, husband of Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin. Days later, The Political Insider is reporting that the hacker group Anonymous has released a damning video exposing Abedin's shady pass. The footage reveals Abedin's extensive personal ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, and that her mother is a member of the group's counterpart organization for women. When she began interning for Clinton at the age of 20, Abedin was also working for a Jihadist legal publication which endorsed Sharia law. In addition, Abedin's family has links to Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Anonymous also released a video detailing Clinton's own criminal past.

NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to: Money laundering Sex crimes with minors (children) Perjury Pay to play through Clinton Foundation Obstruction of justice Other felony crimes NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the department's highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices. 'What's in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,' the NYPD Chief said. 'There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.' The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton. 'People are going to prison,' he said. Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said. 'If they don't cooperate they are going to see long sentences,' a federal law enforcement source said. NYPD sources said Weiner or Abedin stored all the emails in a massive Microsoft Outlook program on the laptop. The emails implicate other current and former members of Congress and one high-ranking Democratic Senator as having possibly engaged in criminal activity too, sources said. Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiner's cell phones and travel records, law enforcement sources confirmed. NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin, however, the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records. Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulge. The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epstein's island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries. Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein's guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island. This is a big tragedy for those childrens, and more than one person should be in jail!

Email Print Pre-election 'results' conditioning public to accept rigged Hillary 'victory' A NBC station was caught posting election results showing a Hillary Clinton victory days before the election, fueling concerns that the mainstream media is conditioning the public to accept a rigged election favoring Hillary. Political activists discovered a hidden web site for WRCB out of Chattanooga, Tenn. showing election results with Hillary Clinton securing 343 electoral votes and 42% of the popular vote. The web site originated from the FTP server of WorldNow, a media software company that provides real-time data '“ such as election results '“ and other media assets to local news stations. The activist who found the page pointed out that the results align well with the 'fractional vote' method used by voting machines to rig elections to a predetermined outcome. 'On election day, you will see the same percentages overall, with only the numbers that claim to equal them different,' the activist reported. 'The difference in total votes shown on the station pages, with the same overall final percentages proves the election theft is automated to hit desired percentages, no one has to lift a finger during the election itself to accomplish the steal.' Election fraud expert Bev Harris was the first to uncover this method, which is also known as 'vote shaving.' 'You need to have votes counted as fractions,' Harris said on The Alex Jones Show Monday. 'You need the votes to be counted with decimal places, like you count money.' 'If a vote is a dollar, you also need to have cents with it. That will not show. It's hidden.' Vote shaving works by treating votes as decimals rather than whole numbers, which allows the machines to allocate the remaining fractional percentages elsewhere to sway election outcomes. 'There's this one central computer, which at the end of the day, all the votes come to it,' Harris pointed out. 'That's where you take it. You don't run around to 5,000 different precincts. You wait until the votes come to you, and then you have your way with them.' And, interestingly, it appears the majority of the local news stations get their election results from the same software company. Skeptics suggested the WorldNow page was part of a code test to ensure the software would post the actual results, but surprisingly, the data on the page was typed in '“ with no apparent code tabulating anything. And it's revealing that, more often than not, when the mainstream media 'tests' election result software, it shows the establishment candidate winning the election. At the very least, the results page shows obvious media bias towards Hillary, and it follows a pattern by the mainstream media to claim Hillary has already won the election weeks before Nov. 8 in an attempt to suppress voter enthusiasm for Trump, which is one of his major advantages. This discovery comes amid Project Veritas' damning videos exposing Democrat operatives discussing how they've been rigging elections for the last 50 years, as well as Wikileaks' relentless data dumping of John Podesta's emails revealing more collusion and corruption between the Clinton campaign and the mainstream media. WRCB could not be immediately reached for comment.

Everyone to your life rafts!' 'Every man and woman for themselves!' 'This ship is going down!' That is just a snippet of what we imagine to be the conversations happening all around the nation within the offices of DNC members. The DNC and Hillary are certainly no strangers to scandal at this point. These days, news reporters can barely keep up with crimes of the Democrats. The party is reaching new lows, practically pushing each other out of the way to commit fraud and lie to the voters. Meanwhile, continuing to try and only show the world what the Republicans are supposedly doing wrong. They would like Americans to believe that only the Republicans are guilty. There are many problems with this, beginning with all of the evidence available. Just a few days ago, the story broke that Democrats were returning contribution money. Returning money? Why on earth would they do that? It may have something to do with the fact that the tens of thousands of dollars from the personal injury lawyers of the Thornton Law Firm was money the partners received in illegal reimbursements. Campaign finance rules prohibit companies like Thornton from giving more than $2,700 to any singular candidate. Straw donor practices easily allow the firms to get around the rule. We wouldn't want laws to get in the way of lawyers and money. In Boston, it was uncovered that the law firm gave their partners bonuses the same day they donated to the campaigns'“in the same amounts. Dirty money given to dirty politicians from dirty lawyers. Perfect headline for Democrats. High profile Senators and candidates have rushed to 'donate' the money they received to the Department of Treasury. This is a common method of 'dumping' tainted money from a campaign. The Democrats involved in this scandal include: Florida Rep. Patrick Murphy Former Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto Pennsylvania Senate hopeful Katie McGinty New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan Former Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold These candidates all have something very important in common: they are fighting for swing-state seats in Senate races. If wrongdoing stopped there, it would be more than enough to disqualify these people when you go to cast your vote. It did not; it went much further. Already these unethical donations made the small Thornton firm, which boasts just ten partners, one of the country's largest dollar for dollar political donors. It turns out this is not the first time that this particular law firm helped out Democrats. The Boston Globe revealed that 'between 2010 and 2014, three of the firm's partners gave $1.6M to mostly Democratic candidates. During that same period of time, those same three partners received $1.4M in bonuses from the law firm, in what appears to be reimbursement for their hefty donations.' As this story broke, it encouraged other people to come forward and admit their involvement. Viveca Novak, who reported the story for the Center for Responsive Politics, told FOXBusiness.com: 
This may not be an isolated case and is likely not the only one of employees being reimbursed for contributions to candidates. We've received emails since the story was published that employees at other companies were pressured to make donations and were told they'd be reimbursed. We always thought it was a much bigger problem, but it is hard to flush out. So here we are with Democrats promptly abandoning ship and handing the money over to the Treasury. Not all of the Democrats, though. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, and best friend to Hillary Clinton, is standing strong and defending her actions. She says she will not return the money until it is proven to be illegal. This is the same Senator who has spent her career sitting on the high horse of condemning hidden money in politics. Elizabeth Warren's hypocrisy aside, this is a very serious situation. Lawyers representing public interest from The Campaign Legal Center have filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission. This is certainly just the beginning of uncovering the truth of the Democrats' campaign practices. The problem we are currently faced with is that the election is 5 days away. Judith Ingram of the Federal Election Commission told reporters that there is a lengthy process to review these complaints for merit and next steps. A complete investigation is exactly what we want and need. It will hopefully continue until they have discovered the whole truth. The election though, is next week. We don't have time. The Democrats in battleground states have been using filthy money to fund their campaigns. There is absolutely no way to know that this money hasn't swayed the election in their favor. Voters in these states need to be aware. They must know the truth before they walk into the voting booth. Information in this election is crucial because the Democrats have done such a good job at muddying the waters around the real issues. There is no telling how deep this goes. As of today, we absolutely have enough information to know a few very important facts: The Democratic party as a whole, cannot be trusted to tell the truth . The money that their campaigns use is not all from legal contributions . The only way to send them a clear message that we will not condone their actions: vote Republican. We need Donald Trump now more than ever. Corruption in politics has gotten so bad that many people don't even bat an eye when we see shocking revelations like this one. On November 8th, we have the opportunity to drain the swamp and root out all of this corruption. We have been given an opportunity, we should take advantage of it!

Email Print This has been the worst week for Hillary Clinton and the best week for the American people. For years, Americans have accepted that Hillary Clinton is simply 'too big to jail.' We began to lose hope when the FBI let her off the hook the first time, but it appears Director Comey knew he had to correct a major wrong. An avalanche of investigations has now occurred against Hillary Clinton, her campaign, and her foundation. FBI Director James Comey made the announcement in a letter last Friday afternoon that the bureau will be reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's illegal use of a private email server. Two days later, the FBI opened a second investigation into the Clinton Foundation. As on November 4th, we have reports that two more investigations have been opened by the FBI. The third investigation spawned from WikiLeaks releasing thousands emails and documents purporting that the Clinton Foundation was linked to child exploitation and Jeffrey Epstein. The fourth investigation entails the IRS reviewing the Clinton Foundation for tax evasion, money laundering, and many other things. Hillary sure does make history. Second time she has been under criminal investigation this year as a presidential candidate. 
'” Martin Walsh (@mrwalsh8) October 28, 2016 According to sources with the FBI , it is being heavily reported that FBI Director James Comey has ordered all agents in the Washington D.C. field office and Hoover Building headquarters to report to work immediately Friday morning. 'We're preparing for many arrests from the top down,' an FBI source stated. 'I cannot elaborate beyond that.' When the FBI source was asked to elaborate on what he meant by 'from the top down,' he added, 'You're a smart guy; read between the lines.' FBI protocol indicates that two scenarios could be unfolding in this situation: The FBI is either preparing to obtain search warrants where they will search any and everything dealing with the Clinton Foundation or they are preparing to make arrests on any and all individuals involved. Or, they are preparing to carry out both actions. We cannot confirm what documents the FBI has, but an FBI source has indicated that they are preparing to make arrests in the coming days. We are unsure if that means Hillary Clinton, but we are confident that many of her cronies will be arrested and charged with several crimes in the coming days. The FBI has the opportunity to right their wrongs. They have more than enough evidence to charge @HillaryClinton . Do your job. 
'” Martin Walsh (@mrwalsh8) November 2, 2016 At this moment, here is a list of the crimes Hillary Clinton and her team are being investigated for by the FBI: Money laundering Sex crimes with minors (children) Perjury Pay to play through Clinton Foundation Obstruction of justice Other felony crimes The FBI would not open several investigations weeks before a presidential election unless the evidence was overwhelming. For the first time in American politics, it appears that no one is too big to jail'“even a Clinton. Sources with with the FBI are indicating that orders have come down from the very top that they will be taking actions immediately against Hillary Clinton, her team, and her foundation. Charges for these crimes would result in long prison sentences as well as hefty fines. They would also result in Hillary Clinton losing this election in a complete landslide. We very well may see Hillary Clinton arrested by the FBI in the coming days. Time will tell. Stay tuned.

Email Print It seems like everyone associated with the Clintons has become immune to common sense. The Obama Justice Department will not do anything to hold this woman accountable, even though far better people than her have had their careers ended over similar crimes. However, the NYPD isn't under Clinton or Obama's control. Erik Prince, Blackwater Founder and Former Navy Seal, told Breitbart what the NYPD's approach might be. According to some of his well-placed sources in the NYPD, Prince told Breitbart the following: 'The NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making [in the Anthony Weiner investigation] but they received 'huge push back' from the Justice Department.' as per Breitbart . Why is the NYPD involved in the Clinton case? Well, they weren't originally, but they made the initial discovery of the new Clinton emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop. Judging from the amount of information they found on the laptop, it seems the FBI and the State Department had insiders protecting Clinton. Allegedly, the criminal activity found on that laptop is enough to make Al Capone blush. 'They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,' Prince said. Prince even gave some insight as to why FBI Director Comey decided to re-open the investigation. In a nutshell, the NYPD forced his hand. 'The amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI,' Prince said. 'They said, 'We're going to go public with this if you don't reopen the investigation and you don't do the right thing with timely indictments,'' Prince explained. 'NYPD was the first one to look at that laptop,' Prince elaborated. 'Weiner and Huma Abedin, his wife '“ the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years '“ have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have '“ they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton's own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.' Allegedly, some of the crimes the emails reveal include money laundering, lying, and even sex trafficking young children. The NYPD doesn't mess around, so they have appointed a new, unbiased, prosecutor in order to investigate these claims by Erik Prince. If only Lynch's Justice Department knew how to make unbiased appointments. The warning for the voters is simple: if Hillary Clinton is elected, there will a constitutional crisis on our hands. She may very well be the first President to be indicted before her first day in the Oval Office. If these criminal accusations are true, they will lead to such staggering events. It would make Watergate seem like a walk in the park. But, its not too late to do the right thing and avoid all of this. Vote Trump and Hillary will be where she belongs '” in prison.

Email Print Cleveland, Ohio '“ Beyonce and Jay Z performed for 'free' at the Get out the Vote concert last night for Hillary Clinton. However, sources revealed that the power couple was paid $62 Million to perform. According to sources closely connected with the power couple, Clinton and her campaign flew Beyonce and Jay Z out to a private meeting to discuss the election. With Hillary lacking the African-American voting numbers that Barack Obama had during his 2008 presidential, the Clinton campaign made a quick and desperate move in their final efforts to secure African-American votes. Empire Herald reported : 'Jay and Beyonce got a call a few weeks ago from Clinton. She invited them for a weekend stay at a luxury hotel to meet regarding the election. Before Jay Z or Beyonce could voice any concerns or ask questions, Hillary pulled out a check. Beyonce saw the check first and her eye lit up like Christmas lights. On the last day of the meeting, Hillary told said to everyone, including Jay Z and Beyonce, 'We definitely got the black vote now.' On the flight back to New York, Jay Z said, 'You know what, Black Lives Matter, they matter because we got paid $62 Million to represent them.' Hillary Clinton can officially add BeyoncÃ© and Jay Z to her list of devoted supporters. The musical power couple headlined a free get-out-the-vote concert in Cleveland on Friday night. . Cole, Chance The Rapper, and Big Sean were also among the list of artists who performed, offering their support to the Democratic nominee for president. As the concert's official main headliner, Jay-Z kicked off the event with 'Dirt Off Your Shoulder,' 'F'”WithMeYouKnowIGotIt,' and a couple of his older hit records. Shawn 'Jay Z' Carter also brought out Big Sean to perform 'Clique'. After Big Sean, Chance The Rapper, and J. Cole finished, BeyoncÃ© made her entrance with her anthemic 'Formation.' But before 'Freedom' rang out, she shared her thoughts about the election. 'There was a time when a woman's opinion did not matter. If you were black, white, Mexican, Asian, Muslim, educated, poor, or rich, if you were a woman, it didn't matter,' BeyoncÃ© said. 'Less than 100 years ago, women did not have the right to vote. Look how far we've come from having no voice to being on the brink of making history again, by electing the first woman president. But we have to vote. The world looks to us as a progressive country that leads change.' She continued: 'Eight years ago, I was so inspired to know that my nephew, a young black child, could grow up knowing his dreams could be realized by witnessing a black president. And now, we have the opportunity to create more change. I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and know that her possibilities are limitless. 'We have to think about the future of our daughters, our sons, and vote for someone who cares for them as much as we do,' she continued, concluding: 'And that is why I'm with her.' After Beyonce's performance, she and her husband, Jay Z, bowed, hugged, and kissed, ending their night with their official endorsement of Hillary Clinton. then Jay Z made his endorsement. 'I want to grow up in a world where our daughter has no limitations. She can feel like she can be whatever she wants to be in the world,' he said. 'This other guy [Donald Trump], I don't have any ill will towards him, but his conversation is divisive, and that's not an evolved soul to me. He cannot be my president. He cannot be our president. Once you divide us, you weaken us. We're stronger together,' Jay Z added. Jay Z then welcomed Hillary Clinton on stage and, along with BeyoncÃ©, gave the 69-year-old politician a big hug. Then, the former Secretary of State grabbed the mic. 'We have a woman who is an inspiration to so many others. I thank BeyoncÃ© for standing up and showing the world we are strongest when we look out for each other,' Clinton said. 'And I thank Jay for addressing in his music some of our biggest challenges in the country: poverty, racism, the urgent end for criminal justice reform.'

VIA Conservative Daily Post In an email sent to Cheryl Mills from John Podesta the evening of March 2, 2015, hours after the New York Times reported that Clinton possibly violated federal record requirements by using the private server, a shocking revelation has been uncovered. According to the latest batch of Podesta's hacked emails, Podesta writes, 'Not to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later.' Mills responded, 'Think you just got your new nick name.' The 'Lanny' reference is to lawyer Lanny Davis, who served as special counsel to former President, Bill Clinton. Lawyers, unfortunately, are not always the most honest individuals and have been known to cover up for their guilty clients. Hillary Clinton is one of these lawyers. Cheryl Mills is the same woman who oversaw the controversial construction of a South Korean sweat shop being built in Haiti. A week after this email exchange took place, Hillary Clinton announced that she would love nothing more than to share her emails with the general public, claiming she had nothing to hide. At least, she didn't think she did. After being subpoenaed by federal court, Hillary Clinton acid-washed her private server, deleting thousands of emails. She denied, under oath, that classified information was ever on the server or sent/discussed via her private email address. Acid-washing a server costs a pretty penny. If she truly had nothing to hide, why did she completely bleach her server free of everything? Thanks to leaked emails from WikiLeaks, it has been proven that Hillary lied when she said no classified information had ever been involved with her private server- Not only was there classified information stored and talked about, but hackers were able to intercept the data and correspondence. New York Post comments, 'Democrats on the House Oversight Committee point to Clinton tweeting on March 4, 2015, calling on the State Department to release her 55,000 pages of work files.' 'I want the public to see my email,' Hillary wrote two days after the Podesta message. At the time, the real Lanny Davis was in support of Clinton addressing her emails. Another WikiLeaks email displays members of the Clinton Organization getting frustrated with Davis' public voicing. 'We gotta zap Lanny out of our universe,' campaign manager Robby Mook wrote Podesta March 8, 2015. 'Can't believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV.' Good thing for Lanny Davis, 'zap' doesn't equate to 'wet-work.' Although Davis may have been rash to announce and support Hillary Clinton's innocence, the DNC had major issues with it. Davis told Fox News host Chris Wallace, during a televised interview, about Hillary Clinton's private email server- 'there can be a neutral party to review all these records '“ nothing unlawful.' Apparently, Davis wasn't given the memo by Hillary Clinton's team regarding her bleached server and it's true contents. 'I think it is a reasonable idea if anybody has any doubts that there's a delete on a hard drive- to have an independent go inspect her private e-mail?' Davis added. Hillary Clinton is known for lying, her own chairman doesn't even believe her when she claims she 'forgets' things. 
EVEN PODESTA KNOWS SHE IS A LIAR! Hillary Clinton wouldn't know honesty if it slapped her in the face. She is a psychopathic liar that thirsts for ways to obscenely scam on a global spectrum. She calls out Donald Trump for 'using the system' but in no way has he abused the system in the grand scale that the Clintons have. He's a business man, he was simply following the laws that government had implemented. Floods of emails and documents are being leaked every day by Anonymous, WikiLeaks and the FBI. These are desperate cries for help mostly from whistle blowers who have been intimately involved with the government, trying to warn American citizens of certain madness and despair that awaits us if Hillary Clinton wins presidency. Donald J. Trump genuinely cares for the American people. He is a natural leader, he enjoys helping people because he believes in bettering America, not policies that encourage 'pay for play'. Hillary Clintons transparency is starting to become blurred. Shatter the busted deception and lock everyone involved with the Clinton scandals in prison. Donald Trump recognizes the need for America to rebuild, which starts with depleting government corruption and replacing government officials. This is something Hillary could never accomplish. Hillary Clinton would just hire her friends and abuse her position of power, as she's done for nearly four decades. John Podesta suggested that Hillary Clinton delete her emails- he must believe she is capable of worse than sharing classified information and as president of the United States, who would stop her from committing even more crime? She would put each and every one of our lives on the line and not think twice. Do you think Hillary Clinton ever gets tired of lying, each lie covering up the next? And even Podesta don't believe her! Why should America?

'” Ã¦donis | hotep (@lordaedonis) November 8, 2016 'This is what I was talking about, they fixed it but it was on some nut sh*t at first,' the man tweeted, adding that a poll worker helped him fix the problem. 'LOL funny that the 'errors' and 'calibration' always favors the Statists. Things that make you go hmmmm'¦.,' responded another Twitter user. The African-American voter said he complained that the polling station appeared to be using old machines. 'I just thought about it, I didn't have to show ID to vote either,' he subsequently tweeted. 
CBS News reports that Trump voters in Pennsylvania are seeing their votes switched to Hillary Clinton. 
'I went back, pressed Trump again. Three times I did this, so then I called one of the women that were working the polls over. And she said you must be doing it wrong. She did it three times and it defaulted to Hillary every time,' Bobbie Lee Hawranko said. As we reported earlier , Trump supporters are also seeing voting machines change their votes in Philadelphia while others have been harassed.

( New York Times Results by County) The media won't tell you this but Donald Trump CRUSHED Hillary Clinton in the recent election in three key areas: For one, the above results by county show that he picked up a significant amount of the counties in the US. The picture is clear that most counties in America voted for Trump . Secondly, the media is also hiding from you that Trump CRUSHED Hillary in the Electoral College (EC). As of today, most if not all media outlets show that Trump won the election with only 279 EC votes. But the truth is Trump also won Michigan with 16 EC votes and Arizona with 11 EC votes for a total of 306 EC votes. Hillary only won 228 EC votes but it looks like she barely won New Hampshire which should put her at 232 EC votes. As a result, Trump won 57% of all EC votes. HIllary turned in the Democratic Party's worst Electoral College performance in 28 years. With only New Hampshire left to be called, Clinton has turned in the Democratic Party's worst Electoral College performance in 28 years pic.twitter.com/APU85Ty50q 
'” Dan O'Donnell (@DanODradio) November 9, 2016 Thirdly, in total states it was a landslide. Trump won 31 states to 19 states won by Hillary or 62% of the states. The mainstream will argue that Hillary beat Trump in the popular vote which appears accurate. According to the NYT she won 59,923,027 to Trump's 59,692,974 for a difference of only 230,053 or 0.4%. But in California and New York Hillary beat Trump by a combined 4 million votes. If not for these two huge liberal states, Hillary would have gotten shellacked in the popular voting as well. The mainstream media will not tell you but Trump won BIGLY!

Email Print In every competition out there, there will be a winner and a loser. It's just the way that competitions work. Literally everywhere you go there are competitions going on and there are always winners and losers. When we are children, we are always taught to be gracious losers. Yes sometimes losing a tough competition hurts, but if you accept it graciously, people will always praise your character. The problem with today's young generation is that they have forgotten how to lose graciously. Since the announcement that Donald Trump has won the presidential election, liberals have been protesting this victory. They're literally ignoring everything that has been taught to them since we were children. It doesn't matter if you don't like the result; Trump won the election and that is a fact. But these protests continue and there is one person that seems to be the mastermind behind it. That would be the ultra liberal billionaire George Soros. He was also responsible for financing some of the protest groups that was designed to have violence at the Trump rallies. During the election season, it was discovered that Soros was behind some of the protestor's actions. He was paying them to create a scene and cause violence that would have the media talking about the Trump rallies. Now this shouldn't have been happening in the first place but it was. And now that Trump has been elected president of the United States, there are people that are out on the streets protesting his victory. It's a little ironic considering that liberals were the ones that were complaining about how Trump wouldn't accept the election results if fraud was detected. Here is the issue though. There are people out on the streets that are protesting a presidential election. These are the same people that were the ones inciting violence at the Trump rallies. And those people were paid by Soros to start, so it's likely that he is the one that is paying them to start civil unrest now. And there is a specific reason that Soros wants to have violence at the protests. That would mean that President Obama would have to declare Martial Law. This is how it works. It's literally a domino effect. There are people out protesting the election results. But when they start having mass amounts of violence at the protests then the entire country is going to start noticing. If that happens then there is going to be pressure on the president to solve it. President Obama would then declare Martial Law. Martial Law is when the president has to suspend transfer of power due to the fact that there is a 'National Emergency.' Therefore if that would happen then Trump wouldn't be able to see the White House because Obama would still be the president of the United States. There is a good chance that this has been the back up plan for some liberals all along. And there is proof out there that the protests are staged. There are protests going on all over the United States and in one part of the nation, Austin, Texas, they found the buses that were used to bring the people in. Again these are planned in order to create civil unrest. And there is more proof. The signs that the people brought to the protests were all created and printed by groups related to the Soros cause. You can't just print thousands of signs on a whim. These events have to be planned and thought out. And that is exactly what was happening. Finally the last bit of proof was that the Democrats and Soros have paid people to protest and create a disturbance at Trump events before. Since they have done it in the past, they are definitely going to do it now. And the Democrats are willing to pay them to create this disturbance. But the scariest part about all this is the fact that people are actually volunteering to protest the election just because Trump won. Again we are taught from a young age to accept defeat with graciousness. Right now they are acting like a bunch of spoiled kids because they didn't get their way. And now there is a possibility that Obama is going to declare Martial Law because of these protestors. They couldn't accept the fact that the country spoke and they wanted Trump in charge. But now they are actively interfering with a Democratic election because they want to complain about the choice. Again this is all most likely due to Soros. And he has had a hand in it before. He wants to see a globalized country and that means that he will do whatever he can to make it happen. That includes ordering an attack on Trump Tower in Chicago . That was where some of the protests in the country were happening. But he also had a hand in trying to fix the election. In 16 States they were using voting machines that were being produced by Soros controlled companies . Of course that meant that he was going to do what he could to rig the election. It most likely wouldn't have mattered if you voted Trump; the machines were going to submit for Clinton. Share this article to show people that Soros has a plan for all of these protests. He wants to make sure that they create enough of a civil disturbance that Obama will declare Martial Law and stop the transfer of power from him to Trump. That way the globalist agenda could still happen. H/T: Conservative Daily Post However the best option is to not engage with the people that are out there. It's like handling a two-year-old child that is throwing a temper tantrum. If you just ignore them they will settle down. Therefore just ignore the protestors and don't engage with them.

And of course Sheriff David Clarke as the Homeland Security Secretary. He has been an incredible patriotic American and leader in Blue Lives Matter. CNN was terrified by this.

Someone who I very much see as if he's not a terrorist inciting terrorism?' said CNN commentator Angela Rye.

Email Print A top member of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign told Clinton's top supporters Thursday her defeat was 'the most devastating loss in the history of American politics,' while campaign chairman John Podesta said the defeat was due to a pro-Donald Trump bias in the media. The remarks were made during a conference call between Clinton's shell-shocked campaign team and several backers of Clinton's campaign, such as donor J.B. Pritzker, Ready PAC co-founder Allida Black, and political strategist Maria Cardona. The contents of the private call were reported by The Hill , which spoke to one of the Clinton backers on the call. Clinton campaign spokesman Jennifer Palmieri didn't mince words in describing how brutal Clinton's upset defeat was, according to The Hill. 'Thirty-six hours after the most devastating loss in the history of American politics, we're looking at a white board right now with lots of ideas,' said Palmieri said. 'We're sort of figuring out what we need to do this week, and what we need Democrats to do in the next two months ahead of the inaugural.' Other aides, meanwhile, tried to shift blame for the shocking defeat away from the campaign and onto the media. 'The media always covered her as the person who would be president and therefore tried to eviscerate her before the election, but covered Trump who was someone who was entertaining and sort of gave him a pass,' said Podesta. 'We need to reflect and analyze that and put our voices forward.' Podesta also pointed a finger at FBI Director James Comey, who resurrected the matter of Clinton's private email server in the final weekend. Podesta said the 'dominance of the way [the media] covered the emails' caused them to drown out issues like Trump's income taxes or his alleged links to Russia. The campaign's explanations apparently didn't do much to remedy the agony of defeat. Black began crying during the call, according to The Hill.

Email Print Ford's heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. That's good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. It's also good publicity for Ford ( F ), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. Ford's south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford's full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. 'Our investment'¦reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,' said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. 'Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.' The move comes at a delicate time for Ford. The United Auto Workers union is in negotiations with the automaker as well as General Motors ( GM ) and Fiat Chrysler ( FCAM ) on new labor deals to replace those that expire next month. And promises by the automakers to keep production and jobs at U.S. plants is a major focus of the union. The union is particularly worried about the plan Ford announced in July to shift production of the C-Max and Focus out of a Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The automaker hasn't said where that work will go, but employees fear those cars will be built in Mexico. It's also not clear whether any other cars will be made at the Wayne plant instead, in order to protect about 4,000 jobs. 'We're actively pursuing other alternatives for the Wayne plant that will be discussed with our UAW friends. We haven't decided what will go there,' said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that if he's elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States. 'How does that help us?' Trump said about the Ford investment in Mexico while campaigning in Michigan this week. 'Mexico is becoming the new China.'

If anyone tries to tell you Hillary won the popular vote, she did not. Besides the 'votes counted' vs. 'votes cast' fact, there's the NON-CITIZENS voting. A whopping three million of them. However, we shouldn't be surprised since both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama told illegals it was A-OK to vote. According to Gregg Philips of votefraud.org, three million illegal aliens voted! This was voters fraud on a massive scale! Hillary is winning the popular vote by about 630,000 votes and there This is voters fraud on an unimaginably massive scale.

I have been reporting for weeks now about the D.C.-based 'pizza pedophilia' ring that is being exposed based on thousands of 'Podesta emails' released by Wikileaks in the past month or two. 
As of last week, the case became even more explosive. 
'” Thomas Bernpaine (@ThomasBernpaine) November 11, 2016 
Now, don't get nervous because it looks like computer mumbo-jumbo. You only need to remember two things. 
1 '“ Every picture file is actually a code/pattern of numbers that our computers 'translate' into images on the screen. 
2 '“ Some 'extra' information has been discovered in at least one picture code/pattern from a Wikileaks email. 
I reported weeks ago about this 'pedo ring' something called 'photo steganography,' which is just the fancy term for the two points I explained just now. 
The image (.jpg) of the two girls eating pizza was discovered as an attachment in the Podesta emails by Wikileaks. Data can be hidden in a .jpg file. In that image, a zipped directory (PK) was hidden inside. That doesn't happen by accident. The directory likely contains illegal imagery and/or discussion. It is highly suggestive of illegal activity connected to child pornography, child exploitation, and child abuse. 
Some have objected that the pizza.jpg file size is simply too small to contain any useful data (like an image, a link, a message, etc.), but the point is this: all the file would have to 'smuggle' is a short password to open a secret website or .zip file. The hidden data could literally just be a few bits of information but it could open up thousands of gigabytes of data in the right website or compressed file. That's how the users would access the dirty pictures, videos, messages, etc. 
So, from a technical angle, this method is very possible, and it makes sense of why the Podesta emails include so many strange photo attachments. Are all those attachments little 'Trojan ponies' for sharing images, videos, passwords, payment resources, etc.? 
WATCH (Language/NSFW Warning): 
'Why do we even have an FBI? Is the FBI just covering for these people?' 
Let me be honest: 
I have researched corruption cases like this for many years, whether in current events or from historical records. So, I believe I have a somewhat thick skin when it comes to facing human sinfulness and evil like this. 
Last Friday night, however, I won't lie: I totally lost it. 
All of a sudden, too many lightbulbs went off at once, too many connections hit me at once, too many implications dawned on me at once'“and I just went into a kind of panic attack about how massive this whole cartel is, how well protected it is, and how truly destructive it is in real children's lives. 
If you want to get an idea of what set me off, let me show you three images. 
BUT I WARN YOU: When you understand the context, these images are EXTREMELY DISTURBING. 
First, here is a photo of Tony Podesta's favorite work of art in his home: 
Tony Podesta is a big fan of 'The Arch of Hysteria' 
Next, here is an ad from Ping Pong Pizza, a restaurant in D.C. that has numerous, very disturbing connections to pedophilia and D.C. elites like the Podestas. 
Another 'arch of hysteria'? 
Next we come to a police photo from the Jeffrey Dahmer case. 
VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED: 
I wonder if Tony Podesta would also like this 'arch of hysteria''¦ 
Finally, here is the logo for Comet Pizza, another D.C. restaurant with deep connections to Ping Pong Pizza and the Podestas. 
Can you see now why I 'lost my [bleep]' last Friday? 
Worse, in terms of how protected this satanic ring of perverts is, I recently reported that even the DOJ is compromised . 
A man named Arun Rao has shown a disturbing interest in some sexually 'creepy' images and expressions that are connected to the Podestas and this pedo ring. The problem is that Rao is an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the DOJ. 
Specifically, Rao is Supervisor of the Southern ('Greenbelt') Division office for the DOJ's District of Maryland in Chevy Chase, Maryland. This means that Rao's district is virtually on top of the area in D.C. where Besta Pizza operates. In addition, Besta Pizza and two other associated properties are directly over abandoned underground tunnels, many of which could easily connect to Chevy Chase. 
On top of his social and geographical proximity to Alefantis, Rao's DOJ division handles cases that seem tailor-made for busting'”or covering up'”the dark circles that sex traffickers hide in: federal racketeering, conspiracy, national and international fraud and corruption, immigration violations, counterfeiting, and '”wait for it'”child pornography . 
In closing I will leave you with three 'infographics.' 
They are very complicated and 'dense' so I don't expect everyone to examine them. 
However, even if you don't look into the details yourself, I want you to be aware of how vast this whole network of evil is, and, therefore, of how many hands and prayers we need on deck to expose it and bring it down. 
(NOTE: You don't have to download these images to view them. You can just right-click open them in a separate internet browser tab, and click '+' to zoom in.) 
'” Thomas Bernpaine (@ThomasBernpaine) November 11, 2016 
First, a diagram of 'key players' in the pizza restaurant side of the pedo ring. You can see the diagram for yourself here . 
Second, a much larger diagram of how this pizza-pedo ring connects to international kidnapping (esp. the Madeleine McCann case) and other DNC allies like 'spirit cooker' Marina Abramovic. 
This is an ongoing investigation so stay tuned for more.

Email Print Hillary Clinton had many vocal celebrities on her side during the 2016 presidential election. However, the election proved that most Americans just don't care what celebrities have to say about politics. In a recent interview, comedian Bill Burr blasted arrogant celebrities, saying, 'Your ego is so f***ing big you think someone is going, 'well, I want to vote for Trump, but if he gets elected, we lose Cher!'' I could not agree more with what Burr said. These people are celebrities and have no knowledge of foreign relations, economics, or anything other than entertainment for that matter. The liberal celebrities feel their ability to read a script translates to the right to pontificate on the most important issues facing our country. Liberals have had Hollywood in their pocket for years. Other celebrities, such as Katy Perry, Robert De Niro, and Salma Hayek, all came out to support Hillary during the election. Why on earth do these people think anyone will change their vote just because an entertainer threatens to leave the country if his or her candidate doesn't win? Even if we did care, we all know they won't really move their entire lives to live in another country. Case in point: have any of these anti-Trump celebrities left yet? I didn't think so. But we should hold them to their vow! Every Hollywood liberal who threatened to leave the United States if Trump was elected should start packing their bags. Send us a postcard when you are freezing your bums off in Canada! Celebrities only demonstrate one thing when they threaten to leave the US over election results: their disgusting arrogance. Do they honestly think they have a better idea about the economic conditions of the middle class than those actually living in the middle class? No. They just think they're entitled to the support of their fans. If they could come down to reality for two seconds and look at the election results, clearly regular Americans don't agree. To be frank, we care more about the future of our country than we do about any of these celebrities. Don't worry'”we'll remember your hypocrisy and self-absorption when you threaten to leave if Trump is re-elected in 2020. What do you think of Bill Burr's comments on Hollywood liberals?

Email Print Donald Trump is reportedly firing around 500 of Barack Obama's staffers, as he plans to completely fill the White House with his own team. The Federalist Papers reported that though it's likely that Hillary Clinton would have let most of Obama's people go so that she could hire her own staff, Trump's win closed the door on the possibility of any of Obama's staffer sticking around. The fired staffers have gotten so desperate about their employment situation that Obama has brought in representatives from Facebook, Instagram and other companies to offer insights into the job market. According to CBS News , Linkedin officials are helping Obama's staff find ways to market their skills. Georgetown University, which is located close to the White House, has designed a custom professional development program they call 'Future44,' Obama is the 44th president, to teach Obama's political appointees how to build their lives after the White House. The program is free of charge thanks to an anonymous donor, and participants register for either four 2-hour evening sessions or one 8-hour 'boot camp.' 'We designed this unique curriculum to help these staffers think through how to market themselves or market their competencies,' said Kelly Otter, dean of Georgetown's School of Continuing Studies. Many of Obama's staffers will likely end up in liberal cities like New York or San Francisco working for companies that cater to millennials such as Amazon, Snapchat, Google, Vice, etc. 'The transition out of government is a reality for most appointees, which brings both excitement about prospects for the next chapter or a long-awaited chance to recharge batteries, and a keen awareness about a big, impending change,' said White House spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman. Ivan Adler, a headhunter at McCormick Group, explained that Obama's staffers are about to face a major change in life that may be hard to get through. 'I tell everybody: You have to understand there's likely nothing you will do professionally that will have the same amount of excitement you've just gone through in the White House, unless you become a racecar driver or an astronaut,' he said. Too bad, so sad'¦Don't let the door hit you on the way out, Obama staffers!

Email Print President Obama has proven he is nothing but a vindictive man who is upset like the rest of the liberals that the person he was lobbying for didn't win the 2016 election. But you'd never guess what he did with hit time in the Oval Office running out. President Obama has shut down the aerial surveillance over the U.S./ Mexican border with only two months left in his presidency. He's trying to make it difficult for President-Elect Donald Trump, as per Watchdog.org The Department of Homeland Security can no longer do its job, and it is not securing the southern border with even the limited measures it has at its disposal right now! This is a move to help illegal immigrants come into this country, with Obama making it less difficult for them to break the law! They won't be seen, and, thus, they won't be caught. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security shut down Operation Phalanx, the aerial program that helps halt the movement of drugs and illegals across the border. This DHS move is challenged by Rep. Henry Cuellar, who claims that Congress gave this operation funding for the whole year of 2017. Cuellar, who is a member of the House Appropriations Committee and the Homeland Security Subcommittee, is composing a letter to send to DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson about the shutdown. And this is not the first time Johnson has been challenged. With the help of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Cuellar went against Johnson earlier in the year in February when the Phalanx's flight operations were reduced. Now, Cuellar is looking for reinforcements in Texas including Sen. John Cornyn and Reps. Mike McCaul and John Carter. McCaul has previously called on DHS to 'develop a strategy to gain operational control' of the border. 'Over the last several years, Congress has provided billions of dollars to secure the borders but without an end goal in mind,' McCaul stated. McCaul has also worked to make legislation 'to require the [DHS] secretary to gain situational awareness through the use of sophisticated technologies and others means, giving our border agents the ability to predict changes in illegal activity.' The DHS claims the illegals coming into the U.S. have declined at the Texas stretch of the border, but apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley rose 27 percent in the fiscal 2016 year alone. In the small Laredo border section, Operation Phalanx accounted for 10,559 apprehensions and 4,007 'turnbacks' from March 2012 to December 2015. Phalanx was credited with seizing 12,851 pounds of narcotics during the period. The fact that Obama would do away with that just because Donald Trump won says a lot about what kind of man our outgoing president is. He would let more criminals and drugs come into this country just to make it harder to control for Trump, but Obama is not hurting Trump'”he's hurting the American people. And that's disgraceful. With Trump in office in January, however, Phalanx will be up and running once more'¦ and Obama can't do anything to stop it.
