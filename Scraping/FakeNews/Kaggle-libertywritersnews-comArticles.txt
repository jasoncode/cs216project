Watch Donald Trump shut down the liberal shill Dana Bash after her ridiculously biased questioning. 
Donald Trump decided to take a day off of campaigning to attend his hotel opening. That's because he has been campaigning 7 days a week. 
Watch this stupid question. 
Dana Bash: 'For people who say you're taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?' 
Now watch Trump tear her a new one. Trump shuts down Dana Bash after questioning him for "taking time off" to attend his hotel's grand opening. 😁 pic.twitter.com/LtLAu1jkbQ

Donald Trump: 'I say the following. You have been covering me for the last, long time. I did yesterday 8 stops and 3 major speeches. And I've been doing this for weeks straight. I left for here for an hour-and-a-half. I'm leaving here and going to North Carolina, then I'm going to Florida, then I'm going up to New Hampshire. For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then goes home and sleeps. And yet you ask me that question. I think it's a very rude question .' I'll say what everyone is thinking. Most unattractive ticket in political history. 
Hillary projects weakness. Kaine, creepiness. pic.twitter.com/MRe5soI5N4

Well folks, it looks like the chickens have finally come home to roost. Karma is a b*tch, ain't it Hillary? 
Hillary Clinton thought if there was one person in the world that she could trust, it was her 'friend' Huma Abedin. 
Thanks to a new drop of emails from Wikileaks, it looks like even Huma has turned on Hillary. Her and John Podest apparently sent a ton of emails right before her campaign started about Hillary Clinton's brain damage. 
The most damning of all the emails from Huma read: 'She (Hillary Clinton) is still not perfect in the head.' Email from Huma Abedin 
The message was sent as a warning to Hillary Clinton's campaign staffers to stick to the notes since Hillary still couldn't think clearly. 
Now, I am no doctor, but I' say if even your closest friends are talking behind your back about you having head problems, that is probably a sign you are sick. Too sick, in fact, to run for president. 
However, I can guarantee you that the second this email got released, Hillary gave the kill order to her media goons to bury this story so deep that it will never see the light of day. 
If you want the world to see how Broken Hillary Clinton really is, then do us all a favor and share this out to everyone you know on Facebook. This is our ONLY way to get the truth out there!

This is the news everyone has been waiting. A Super Computer in India, which correctly predicted our ENTIRE Primary season, was just used to predict the results of the US Presidential election. 
The computer took into account more than 20 Million data points across the US, factoring in things most groups ignore like interaction of Facebook, Twitter, and Google, and came up with this as it's final result… DONALD TRUMP WILL DEFINITELY WIN THE US ELECTION!! 
The Program, known as MoglA, was developed back in 2004 by an Indian developer named Sanjiv Rai. It has since been collecting Data and learning from every US election cycle, and has predicted every single trend since then. 
The news gets even better, though! As if it were not enough already that Trump is predicted to win, …He has also beat Barack Obama's peak engagement figures from back in 2008 by 25 Percent!!! 
Now that is something the Lamestream media does NOT want you to know about. 
So I say Nate Silver and all the other Hillary shill pollsters can suck it! The Super Computer has spoken, and the winner is Donald Trump. 
Now it's up to us to get this shared out all across Facebook so the world sees that the Revolution is REAL!

This is great news, everyone. It may have taken awhile, but it looks like the FBI is finally ready to take Hillary down for good! Donald Trump is soooo happy!!! 
Just moments ago, the FBI received the warrants that they had been waiting for so that they can search Anthony Weiner's laptop for the Clinton emails he had stored. 
To make it worse, the file that he had stored the emails in on his laptop was supposedly called 'Life Insurance.' 
You see, the FBI had already searched the laptop once for emails relating to Anthony Weiner and his 15-year-old sexting partner, but technically they couldn't look through the Clinton emails they discovered. 
Well, this warrant will let them do exactly that. We already know that these new emails are both classified and maybe even CRIMINAL. Now we can finally make her taste justice for good. 
So I just wanna take a moment to say 'THANK YOU' to the FBI. Thank you for finally growing a pair and taking on Hillary Clinton the way she needed to be. 
Now we need to share this out and let the world know the good news! Goooo Donald Trump!

Hillary Clinton has gone and done it now! After acting like she has nothing to hide in the emails seized by the FBI, she managed to pull some strings and sabotage the NEW investigation before it even began… 
It turns out that she got her good friend Loretta Lynch to assign a man named Peter Kadzik from the Department of Justice to oversee the case against her. Peter Kadzik 
So who is Peter Kadzik? Well, thanks to Wikileaks we know that he is a good, personal friend of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager and future Chief of Staff if she wins. 
In fact, Peter Kadzik was mentioned more than TWENTY TIMES in Podesta's emails! 
Now just try and tell me that is not as rigged as it gets. 
This is gonna be an all out war between the FBI and the Department of Justice, and if we want Hillary to get her just deserts, we gotta be ready to help Director Comey fight back! 
Now, step one to beating Hillary Clinton is to share this out to everyone you know. We the people need to demand a FAIR investigation. NEXT PAGE==>

If you love Donald Trump, then you are gonna really LOVE this. Obama figured he was untouchable, but Trump just pulled out the big guns and Obama is absolutely horrified!! 
Trump told his rally in Florida today that… Obama was aware that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were hiring people to beat up Trump supporters at his rallies! 

Donald Trump actually made a great point. The guy behind the violent attacks was a Democrat named Bob Creamer. Creamer, a convicted felon, admitted on tape to hiring the attackers for Hillary! 
However, when more digging was done, it was discovered that Creamer visited the White House over 300 times since Obama became president. 
Trump said, 'He visited the White House, I think it was 344 times, right? But he said, 'Yeah, but I only saw that president 44 times.' Oh, well that's okay. So I'm sure the president didn't know anything about the violence, right?' Trump also reminded the crowd that Hillary Clinton actually paid one of the fighters $1500 and a new cell phone in return for causing a massive fight at his Chicago rally. Look, these are the exact same tactics that Hitler use. Hillary Clinton is exactly like Hitler. I call her Hitlery! If you wanna stop Hitlery, then the first step is to share this article out and make the world see Trump is way better. Step two is to get out and VOTE!

Okay, So I'm just gonna go on ahead and say that the Trumps are an incredible family. Donald is a strong figurehead, his sons are composed, and Ivanka will be the first woman president. Melania just shook the nation with a new, incredible speech (that Michelle Obama cannot claim!) ***Now a new Trump has risen. Earlier today, Melania shook the nation with a new, incredible speech (that Michelle Obama cannot claim!) 
She took the stage in Berwyn, PA and began with a simple smile. Then, Melania opened up and told a story. A story of a little girl growing up in the Soviet Union and dreaming of someday being an American. 
She told how that little girl made it here. She worked hard and got LEGAL citizenship. And now, that same little girl is about to become our next 1st lady. She is that little girl. 'When I was 10-years-old we learned that a man named Ronald Reagan was elected president of the United States of America. President Reagan's 'morning in America' was not just something in the United States, it began to feel like morning around the world, even in my small country. It was a true inspiration to me.' I think Melania Trump is a true inspiration to American immigrants. She is proof that hard work and dedication can pave the way to success in this country. If you agree and wanna help share this amazing speech out, all you gotta do is send it to all your best Facebook friends who love Trump. We can do this together!

O man! I cannot stand Starbucks. Why the hell can companies not realize that people like them for their PRODUCT and do NOT want their freaking political opinions?! 
Now Starbucks has decided to drop their traditional holiday cups and replace them with a brand-new pro-Hillary cup! This is a total 'screw you' to Donald Trump. 
I present to you the 'Shared Values' cup, named after Hillary Clinton's own 'Stronger Together' campaign slogan… 
Yeah, Starbucks, we get it! You want to stay socially relevant and your CEO is a HUGE Hillary Clinton supporter. But you know what, I'm not buying it! 
Look, there are plenty of other coffee places to go to that won't screw you out of your political opinions. Maybe try one of these: Pete's Coffee

On Jan. 20, 2001, Bill Clinton issued a pardon for the fugitive Marc Rich. This happened on his last day in office. 
Marc Rich traded with America's enemies. He traded with Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran when the Ayatollah held 53 Americans hostage in 1979. He made $2 billion selling oil to South Africa during the UN embargo of the country. He did deals with Khadafy's Libya,Milosevic's Yugoslavia, Kim Il Sung's North Korea, Communist dictatorships in Cuba and the Soviet Union itself. 
*** He was on the FBI's ten most wanted list. 
Now, we know that Bill Clinton pardoned Marc Ritch because his wife gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton's senatorial campaign. 
There is literally evidence that Bill Clinton pardoned a known criminal because that criminal gave money to the Clinton Foundation. 
*** HOW MUCH MORE CORRUPTION CAN WE STAND!?!? 
Share this everywhere! We need to take down the Clinton's this week. This is the final stand. The second American revolution has started. It is peaceful and it relies on the people of the United States waking up to the crimes of the Clintons. 
Share this 1 million times, patriots!

CNN is over. CNN is over! We need to black them off the television screen. They should not even be aired in the United States because they are nothing but a propaganda arm for the Clinton campaign. WIKILEAKS JUST LEAKED PROOF THAT CNN WORKS WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. 
They were just caught colluding with the DNC on what questions Wolf Blitzer should ask Trump ahead of his foreign policy address. 
Here is a newly leaked email by Wikileaks with someone from the DNC asking for questions from the DNC to send to Wolf Blitzer. You can find the Wikileaks here . 
Here is a new Wikileaks email where someone named [email protected] asking for questions to ask Cruz on CNN. You can find the Wikileaks by clicking here .

Trump won last night and sheeesssshhhh was it a landslide. That was ugly. Look at this. Hillary spent twice as much as Trump and got nothing for it. Hillary raised $520 million for her campaign compared to the $270 that Trump spent. 
*** That means that she spent twice as much as Trump and got NOTHING for it. 
That's why she was supposedly crying the night of the election and didn't come out and speak. Instead, she sent John Podesta out to address the crowd of social justice losers that had come to see her.

President Obama is preparing to stab Trump in the back. He is using all of his remaining time to push the TPP through congress, according to the U.S. ambassador to Canada. 
*** Look at Obama now!! Look Obama is doing work. 
Where was your ass when there was stuff to do. Here is Obama's normal work day. 
Obama has now spent more time golfing than any other president in history and now that is about to lose his presidency he is working to pass a bill that will destroy America. 
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both oppose the TPP and it would make up 40% of the world's economy. We simply cannot let this deal go through, patriots! According to Canadian press the US ambassador to Canada has stated that Obama will push for #TPP to passed before Trump takes power. 
This is a corporate money grab. This will not bridge the wealth gap in this country. It will increase it.

We cannot let Obama get away with the biggest steal of his entire presidency. Trump needs to know about this. He needs to stop this. SHARE THIS SO THAT TRUMP CAN SEE IT.

Hillary Clinton has barely just lost the presidential election and here she is already getting herself caught in another one of her tangled web of lies. 
The day after losing, a picture was posted of her taking her dog out for a walk. The picture was reportedly from a random hiker she ran into and showed that she was getting back to public life, or that's what she wants you to believe. 
Now, I want you to do me a favor and take a very close look at this picture, specifically the 'hiker' she met. Memorize her face… 
Got it? Okay, good. 
Now what I am about to show you is something Hillary Clinton was hoping nobody else would notice. Tell me if the girl in the 2nd picture, taken in the 2000's, reminds you of anyone: 
Yeah, it is the EXACT SAME GIRL! 
Her name is Margot Gerster and her mother just happens to be one of the big fundraisers for Hillary. That's actually where the older picture was taken. 
Wow! That doesn't seem random at all, does it? 
It looks like this is yet another example of Hillary Clinton trying to mislead the public using her inner circle and pretending like she doesn't know them. 
All I gotta say is, give it the Hell up, Hillary! You lost, nobody needs to see your 'chance encounters' or other promotional propaganda anymore. This is exactly why Americans ended up hating you! 
Oh well, I guess you really cannot teach an old dog new tricks. Well, in that case all that's left to do is share this all across Facebook and the internet and expose yet another one of her Serial Lies!

Donald Trump has finally done it! Less than a week after his presidential nomination, Trump has kept his word on 'Draining the Swamp' in Washington DC with a new ruling that has lobbyists p*ssing all over themselves!! 
In a historic move never before seen by a US President, Trump declared that ALL officials working with his campaign, on his transition team, and in his cabinet will be BANNED from working as DC lobbyists for 5 years to prevent them from abusing their connections for self-gain! Image From Gawker 
Not only that, but ANYONE who wants to work for Trump is now required to immediately end ALL of their current connections to lobbying groups or be FIRED instantly. 
But the Donald was not done yet. To put icing on the cake, he has also moved to officially have the term lobbyist apply to ALL DC insiders working as 'consultants' or 'advisors' when in reality, 'we all know they are lobbyists.' Video by CNN – Trump Drain the Swamp!! 
Of course, you know all the long-time Senators and lobbying groups are already freaking out. Mitch McConnel refused to acknowledge the ban when pressured by reporters while the National Institute for Lobbying and Ethics tried to intimidate Trump by saying 'This will have a chilling effect on his hiring, no doubt.' 
Uh, yeah. Now Donald Trump will have to hire people NOT trying to line their pockets with hundreds of millions of tax payer dollars. Sounds like a real loss to me…NOT!! 
If you are proud of President Trump for standing up against the DC lobbyists and career politicians, let him know by sharing this out to every person you know!!
