You would be like Madonna and give head for a vote, wouldn't you? Beyonce would screw the Devil for 62 million dollars'¦ SecedeTexas 
try and denounce this on Truth or Fiction. If it wasn't true they would be all over it. Cjarmaine 
If you recall many many people left after everyone was done performing and Hillary started talking. So i guess the money doesn't matter that's why they did it, they knew the crowd would dwindle once they were done'¦. LMAO!!!! bubbaclinton 
You know she is crooked to the bone. Lawrence Hodge 
Yea totally. Because the key to Black Votes is Jay Z and Beyonce. That's like saying Trump paid Bruce Springsteen $50 million to secure White votes. Ken Adams 
Except Springsteen is another liberal idiot, so your logic fails, you moron. TomAZUSA 
Total bullshit. I don't believe this. Noli Timere 
Think of the POVERTY and Student Loans they could wipe out with that JACK! Liam Kelly 
62 million, sure, unnamed sources claims. Not one respectable news organization has verified that number. These guys are playing Gawker Roulette. pitriver 
Might want see if the 62 million came from the foundation. Liam Kelly 
Might want to see if that 62 million number is anything close to real. All stories use this as their source. This has no source. So in other words its a bunch of lies. 
Yes Empire Herald I am calling you out on your obvious and flagrant lie. SecedeTexas 
the fact that Truth or Fiction is not commenting tells me that this true. Liam Kelly 
Any source to back up your 62 million dollar claim? I mean remember what happened to Gawker. I'm sure Jay Z and Beyonce could take you to the cleaners. Weather
