There are so many reasons Americans should not vote for Hillary Clinton, but one of those reasons is this woman's tyrannical plans to strip us of our Second Amendment rights. What many people do not realize is that if she becomes president, Hillary would ban many of our favorite guns, as revealed in a bombshell report that was just leaked. 
In a recent WikiLeaks dump, we got an inside glimpse into Hillary's diabolical plans to trample all over our gun rights if she becomes president. If you thought Obama's tyranny with bypassing Congress and enacting his will via executive orders was obnoxious, it won't hold a candle to this woman's plans. She blatantly expressed how she would impose massive gun control through executive fiat in a manner 'more aggressive than Obama,' while chipping away at our Second Amendment with a myriad of new regulations and gun laws. 
While Hillary likes to pump us full of crap, claiming that 'law-abiding Americans wouldn't be targeted' with her tyranny, her broad and evasive gun control measures would directly affect Americans with no criminal records, while having zero impact on the behavior of violent criminals. 
One example is Hillary calling for the 'reinstatement of the national assault weapons ban and a prohibition on high-capacity magazines.' However, the result of her 'assault weapons' ban would essentially take up a massive category of firearms, including the popular AR-15, while making 'high capacity' magazines illegal to even possess. 
We all know these types of regulations are completely ineffective in preventing gun violence since criminals have no regard for laws in the first place and are obviously not going to turn over their guns just because Hillary decides to pass a law. 
Her other Constitution-subverting plan is to pass a law making it legal for 'victims of gun violence' to sue gun manufacturers, which would quickly bankrupt these companies. However, Hillary's ultimate goal is to ban all guns in America completely by utilizing the Supreme Court. With her hand-picked justice filling Antonin Scalia's vacancy, she would have the SCOTUS revisit the District of Columbia v Heller (2008) ruling. If successful, the court would eliminate it's previous affirmation that it is an individual's Constitutional right to keep and bear arms. 
When you put all the pieces together, Hillary's plans for America is nothing short of chilling. History taught us the brutal lesson about what happens when a populace is unarmed — images of corpses from Nazi concentration camps come to mind. Add Hillary's gun-grabbing plan to her dream of turning America into a borderless society and flooding our country with Muslim refugees, and you have the perfect recipe for disaster. 
God help us if this woman is elected. Continue to share stories like this and tirelessly work to expose this woman before election day. Once she's in office, the America that we know and love will be drastically transformed into a third-world country crap hole, and Hillary's life-long plans will be complete.

Man Finds Heartbreaking Note On Car, Last Line Teaches Him NASTY Lesson Posted on October 26, 2016 by Robert Rich in News  
After coming out to the parking lot, a motorist was puzzled to see that there was an unexpected note on his car. However, the situation would soon take a heartbreaking turn when he read what was inside – until he got to the last line, which taught him perhaps the nastiest lesson of his life. 
Although details surrounding the note are unclear, the account was posted to Reddit , along with a corresponding image on Imgur , depicting quite a strange series of events. As it turns out, a man found a note on his car only to realize that it was a devastating story about a stranger's cancer-stricken grandfather. Stock image of note on car 
As explained in the note, the writer was about 10-years-old at the time his grandmother desperately tried to get her husband to quit smoking. According to the stranger , his grandmother said to his grandfather, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you need to stop immediately.' 
The seemingly harsh message apparently had a dramatic and instant effect on his grandfather as he recalls that his eye's welled up with tears. Sure enough, the man quit that day – but unfortunately, it was too late. 
In a heartbreaking twist, the note details how the writer's grandfather died just 3 years later of lung cancer, never seeing his grandkids graduate. As if that wasn't gut-wrenching enough, the note went on as the stranger explained how his mother begged him never to smoke, saying 'don't put your family through what your grandfather put us through.' The note in full (Source: Mirror ) 
Of course, he obliged. However, the note seemed to change in sentiment at that moment, and the writer taught the driver of the car a nasty lesson with the last line of the odd note. 'I must say, I feel a slight sense of regret for never having done it because your parking job was so sh*tty that it gave me cancer anyways,' he wrote. 'Jesus, f*ck, please learn how to park.' 
You have to admit, this dig was perhaps the most well thought out act of passive aggression that has been seen in quite some time. Although the message came across a bit rough, I think it's safe to say that this guy won't be parking outside the lines for quite some time.

 A Muslim family in the United Arab Emirates arranged a marriage for their son, only to find that he 'got out' of the deal in the most gruesome way. 
The family of a Muslim man was celebrating the upcoming wedding of their young patron when they suddenly heard blood-curdling screams coming from his room. When his brother rushed to see where what all the shrieking was about, he stumbled upon a gruesome scene with the groom holding something horrific in his hand. 
Most ancient religions and cultures have a history of arranging marriages and often forcing unwilling participants into betrothals with people they've never met and have no desire to wed. However, unlike many other ideologies, Islam rampantly continues to cling to not only arranged marriage but also polygamy, child marriage, and incest. Unlike other religions that have reformed and progressed, there is no hope for Islam, as its most revered prophet commanded and modeled these same barbaric behaviors. 
In a bizarre series of events, a young Muslim man in the United Arab Emirates found himself in an arranged marriage that he found completely insufferable. The 26-year-old refused to take a second wife, a refusal that is uncommon with men in Muslim-majority countries unless the bride is found to be undesirable for reasons including defilement, unsatisfactory appearance, poor financial status, or un-Islamic behavior. Instead, the young man, who has a wife and 2 daughters in another country, found a way to dissolve the betrothal in the most shocking way. 
Feeling that there was no other way to get out of the engagement, the Khaleej Times reports that the unnamed man decided to render himself 'unfit' to be married by taking a knife and slicing off his genitals. He surmised that if he is unable to perform his marital duties by consummating their wedding night, his fiance's family would be convinced to pull their daughter out of the arranged marriage. 
The Muslim groom's family was adamant that he marry a second wife, somehow forcing the 26-year-old man into a marriage of their own choosing. It was after a family argument that the groom's brother heard blood-curdling screams and burst into the room to find the man covered in blood and his genitals mutilated. 
The brother immediately rushed the young man to the Al-Kuwaiti Hospital, collecting the severed penis in a plastic bag. Thanks to the brother's quick thinking, doctors at the nearby Al-Qassimi Hospital accepted the victim as a transferred patient and informed him that they would be able to reattach the organ. 
'I have conducted a number of surgeries on male organs; but this case was very strange and rare as the organ was separated from the body and was brought to us in [a] plastic bag,' Dr. Younis Al-Shamsi added. 
Incredibly, the Muslim man refused the surgery, arguing that he would still be forced to marry the woman after his recovery. After much coaxing, his brother finally convinced him to have his penis surgically reattached. The process took just 3 hours, and the man is expected to make a full recovery. 
The Quran states that men are allowed to take up to 4 wives as long as they provide for them. The latter part of the scripture even encourages Muslim men to marry one of their sex slaves 'who their right hand possesses' if they have trouble finding a suitable Muslim woman. Of course, Allah considers women nothing more than property, as the Quran states twice that men should beat their wives if they fear even the slightest disobedience from them. In fact, Allah specifically told Job, a character stolen from Judaism and Christianity, that he must take a tree branch and beat his wife after she mocked him in her grief over the loss of their children. 
Likewise, the Islamic prophet Muhammad proved that this was what Allah intended by beating his own child bride , Aisha, after she caught the pedophile sneaking out of their house in the middle of the night. His reasoning was that his property had left the house without his permission. 
Luckily for the fiance, this man didn't see her as his next victim with whom he could unload his perverse sexual fantasies and physically torture her if she had any objection. Still, the Islamic oppression of women and children continues to see millions enslaved to abusive predators that are given divine authority to treat them as they wish.

A man was pulling out of his driveway when his wheel suddenly got stuck. Initially, he thought he had accidentally driven up on his flower bed, but once he took a closer look, he realized there was a hole in the ground. There was also a ladder in the hole, but nothing could have prepared him for what he'd find when he daringly went down. 
Simon Marks was pulling out of his driveway in Luton, England, when he thought he had accidentally driven into one of his flowerbeds. When he got out to inspect the damage to the flowers, he quickly realized that he had been mistaken. He hadn't driven onto his flower bed at all. Instead, there was a gaping hole in his driveway. 
Even more unbelievable than the sudden hole that appeared, he also saw that there was a ladder in the hole, where the driveway collapsed. Wanting to know what the odd discovery was all about, he bravely took a look and was shocked to find a two-roomed shelter. Simon Marks next to the air raid shelter (Source: The Sun ) 
'This massive hole appeared. I thought it was a sinkhole or a badly constructed garden,' Simon explained, according to The Sun . 'I was just terrified the whole house was going to vanish. I took some pictures and sent them to my dad. When I moved a few of the slabs out of the way, I found a ladder. I got my selfie stick and put it down the hole where I saw two rooms.' 
When his dad Gerald saw the pictures, he instantly knew what it was – an air raid shelter. After looking on the internet for some more information, Simon and his father learned that there were quite a few of these bomb shelters in the area and that this particular one had probably been built after a German bomb landed nearby during World War II. Bottles and newspapers were found inside 
'The previous owner must have known it was there, and when he built the house and put a garden in, he must have filled it in,' he explained. 'He clearly wasn't very worried about it and it just sat there until the hatch fell through. I think it's great and I want to clear it out and preserve it if it's structurally sound.' 
The shelter is nearly 10 feet deep and was full of mud. As Simon and Gerald began excavating the shelter with buckets, they found various items along with glass bottles and old newspapers. 'It's incredible to think it has all been made by hand,' Simon admitted. 'It's part of our history so it should be kept.' 
This just goes to prove that you never know when you'll accidentally stumble on a piece of history hidden in your own backyard or your driveway. I can guarantee that Simon had no idea that his property held a treasure of the past – so you never know what you might stumble on someday and what it could reveal about the history in your area.

Hillary's Bizarre Spanish Birthday Bash, Tells Illegal Aliens SECRET Message Posted on October 26, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics  
It's Hillary Clinton's birthday, and unfortunately, no one is shocked that she spent time on Univision on some ridiculous talk show, pandering to illegal aliens during a bizarre Spanish birthday bash. However, what is leaving many in disbelief is what she promised illegal aliens off the record if she gets elected. Unfortunately for her, Univision let everyone know her secret message to them, and it's pissing Americans off. Hillary's birthday cake (left), Hillary samples cookies (right) 
Hillary is on her final leg of her ill-fated campaign, and it's perfect that she showed her true colors on Univision's Spanish-language talk show called 'Gordo & Flaca' (Fat & Skinny) with a little person called Producer Carlitos who led Hillary around like a pet pony. It was so pathetic as they made her repeat words like 'vote' and 'president' in Spanish while the crowd laughed at her bad accent. 
It's cringe-worthy enough when a 69-year-old grandmother panders to a bunch of buffoons in any language, but the fact that it was an American woman running for president makes it disgusting. However, let's look past the idiotic looking birthday cake coming from what is supposed to be an unbiased news source, albeit a Hispanic one. Instead, let's learn what Hillary said directly to illegal aliens that have so many Americans pissed off today. It's Hillary pandering at her best, or it's the worst optic ever, and she should have canceled. 'I want to be a really good president for you,' she said in one outtake posted by the show online. 'I want to give you every opportunity to be successful in our country.' Clinton announced a free concert Saturday with latin pop stars Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony. [via Daily Mail ] Did you catch that? Hillary wants to give illegal aliens every opportunity to be successful in our country, and this was an outtake because her campaign wanted none of that talk to get posted online. Hillary is struggling badly with the heavily Cuban areas in Florida, where they routinely vote Republican, and the one thing she needs is Florida. At the end of this one minute video, you can hear Hillary say to Gordo (Fatty), ' You'll make the difference not just here in Florida , but everywhere.' The Cuban-Americans don't take kindly to illegal aliens of any race, so where they might watch Univision, they will not like Hillary looking ridiculous, and they will especially not like her encouraging illegal aliens in that message that was supposed to be off the record. Now for the other stupid Hillary moment, which was another bad optic for her. Producer Carlitos gave Hillary an expensive bottle of tequila as Hillary looked all bugged eyed wanting to down a shot. Producer Carlitos led Hillary like a pet pony onto the stage (left), Carlitos gave Hillary tequila (right) The path to Hillary's White House runs through non-white voters. Think about that. Yes, America is a melting pot, but we want a legal melting pot. Wanting those in America to actually be legal Americans isn't racist since 'illegal' isn't a race. What Donald Trump said was that it's okay to be proud to be American. In fact, it's vital we be proud to be Americans once again — and all races in the United States can and should feel that way. Hillary needs to pander to those minorities who, unlike Cuban-Americans, believe illegal aliens have the same rights in America as Americans . It's crazy and proves that Hillary cares nothing about America. She is a pure globalist, who is working for those who want open borders everywhere. I truly believe that Americans are smarter than Hillary and her cabal of globalists know. Let those at Univision and those who hate America get this message loud and clear: America is not Hillary's country to give away. It's every Americans' country, and we each have one vote to make sure she can never give our birthright away.

 Baylee Luciani (left), Screenshot of what Baylee caught on FaceTime (right) 
The closest Baylee Luciani could get to her boyfriend, who's attending college in Austin, was through video online chat. The couple had regular 'dates' this way to bridge the 200-mile distance between them. However, the endearing arrangement quickly came to an end after his FaceTime was left on and caught something that left his girlfriend horrified. 
Baylee had been discussing regular things with her boyfriend, Yale Gerstein, who was on the other side of the screen on an otherwise average evening. This video chat was not unlike all the others she had with Yale from his apartment near Austin Community College until the 19-year-old girlfriend heard some scratching sounds after FaceTime had been left on. 
According to KRON , Baylee was mid-conversation with Yale when scratches at the door caught both of their attention and he got up from his bed, where the computer was, to see who was at his door. He barely turned the handle to open in when masked men entered the room and beat Yale's face in and slammed him down on his bed while shoving a pistol in his cheek. The intruders didn't seem to know or care that FaceTime was still on and Baylee's face, seen in the corner, was watching everything, terrified that she was about to see her boyfriend murdered in front of her, as she watched him fight for his life. 
Admitting that she first thought it was a joke, seconds later, she came to the horrid realization that he was being robbed and called her dad, who was at home with her in Dallas, into the room. 'I was scared, because they were saying I'm going to blow your head off, I'm going to kill you,' Baylee explained along with the chilling feeling she got when the intruder finally realized the video chat was running and looked right at her in the camera. 'I'm like wow… seriously watching an armed robbery happen to somebody that I care about,' she added. Screengrabs of intruder forcing Yale down on his bed while Baylee and her father watch on FaceTime in horror 
With a clear view of at least one intruder's face, Baylee began taking screenshots of the suspect in the act as she and her dad called the police to report what was going on. She got the pictures right in time since, seconds later, the intruder decided to disconnect the computer as he and the suspects took off with thousands of dollars worth of Yale's music equipment. Although the boyfriend's life was spared in the traumatizing ordeal for the two of them, he said that the thieves took something from him that can't be replaced. 
'I had just finished my first album as a solo artist,' Yale said. 'That's all lost,' since they took the recordings on the equipment, which means nothing to the thieves and everything to the victim. It's not often that you hear of FaceTime solving crimes or potentially saving lives, which is what happened in this case. Although it was difficult to watch, Baylee, being there through technology, was an instrumental part in protecting Yale, who hopefully learned that he better take advantage of Texas' great gun laws and arm himself with more than just a computer.

Insider Leaks Bill's 2-Word Nickname For Hillary, Exposes Dirty Sex Habits Posted on October 26, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics  
Bill and Hillary Clinton just can't stay out of the spotlight these days, and the most recent leak about them could be the most damaging yet. As it turns out, someone once close to the duo just came forward to share Bill's revealing nickname for his wife — but the worse comes as their dirty bedroom habits were exposed. Bill and Hillary Clinton (left), Photoshopped image of Hillary (right) 
It's no mystery that Bill Clinton is a sexual deviant, but the most recent account given by the woman who had a 3-decade affair with the man is damning, to say the least. According to an exclusive interview given to Mail Online , Dolly Kyle was behind the scene's long enough to not only know the two's darkest secrets but even their dirty sexual habits – and now, she's telling everyone. 
The connection between Dolly and Bill began when she was just 11-years-old. He was about 13-years-old at the time, but Dolly states that there was an immediate attraction, even then. As the years progressed, the two became romantically involved and stayed that way through several of their marriages over the next 30 years. Dolly Kyle (Source: Mail Online ) 
The real affair began in 1974 just after Dolly divorced her first husband, and although Bill wasn't married yet, he would be within the year. Although she was never interested in sharing the intimate details of the relationship, she states that she snapped when she heard Hillary recently say that all sexual assault victims have the 'right to be believed.' 
Knowing full well just what Hillary had done – between the threats and the lies – to the many women who either had an affair with or were sexually assaulted by her husband Bill, Dolly knew she had to do something about it. Unfortunately for Hillary, Dolly is now coming forward with the dirty 2-word nickname Bill husband once called Hillary, among other things. 
According to Mail Online , Bill approached Dolly at their high school's 35-year reunion to talk about ' the warden ' – a.k.a. Hillary. Saying he was unhappy with his life and marriage, this was the least significant account Dolly had to share. A very unhappy Bill and 'the warden' Hillary Clinton (Source: Mail Online ) 
In fact, Dolly recalls that Bill mentioned something about having a baby to her. Although she thought he was saying he wanted to have one with her, he was actually talking about Hillary. He wanted to put to bed the rumors that Hillary was a lesbian, even though everyone in their hometown already knew it to be true. 
Dolly states that the worst came when she met Hillary for the first time. 'In that moment I noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering [body] odor of perspiration and greasy hair. I hoped that I wouldn't gag when she got in my car,' she said. 'The sandal-shod woman with lank, smelly hair stood off to the side and glared at everyone.' Bill and Hillary Clinton (Source: Mail Online ) 
No wonder Bill went elsewhere to fulfill his 'sexual addiction,' as Dolly referred to it. After all, what else can you do when you're married to a stinky woman who doesn't shower and isn't attracted to men anyways? Although an affair is never justified, it's easy to sympathize with Bill on this one. But, I digress. 
The bigger point here is what the two are willing to do in order to remain in power. Most people know that you can't trust Hillary as far as you can throw her – which isn't very far – so the fact that she has any supporters is beyond baffling at this point. This woman is corrupt and fake to the core. Let's just hope all of America wakes up to this reality before it's too late and she can do any more damage than she already has.

VIDEO: Idiot Destroys Trump's Hollywood Star, Gets BAD NEWS Seconds Later Posted on October 26, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics  
Social media is buzzing about Donald Trump's Hollywood star being destroyed in California. However, it seems that the man responsible just came forward by making a video – but his stupid stunt turned around and slapped him big time when he got bad news just a short time later. 
Since the beginning of his campaign, Trump's Hollywood star in Los Angeles, California has sustained it's fair share of vandalism. From people spray painting a Nazi swastika on it to literally taking a crap on it, the most recent stunt was far worse than all the rest. 
Seemingly trying to destroy the star for good, a man, who has since been identified as James Otis, used a sledgehammer and pickaxe in order to help him vandalize the well-known emblem. All caught on video by shocked onlookers, Otis could be seen hitting the star with a pickaxe resulting two plates breaking free. 
As it turns out, those plates depicted both the Hollywood star television emblem and the presidential hopeful's name. Since that point in time, Otis has come forward in order to claim his fame – but it took mere seconds for him to realize that not everything is exactly going according to his poorly thought out plan when he promptly got some bad news. Donald Trump's star before (left) and after (right) (Source: TMZ ) 
Although the man states that he's willing to go to jail for his crimes, he may not have actually known what he was getting himself into. According to The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, the plaque is (or was) worth a whopping $30,000, meaning that Otis admitted to a felony. 
Felony vandalism (damaging over $10,000 worth of property) can result in imprisonment for up to three years in state prison and a fine of up to $50,000. Otis stated that he does intend to turn himself in and has already hired a lawyer, but we'll see just how tough he is when he has to face a judge. 
The tough guy wannabe later added that he 'wanted to face Trump in court,' but the idiot must have forgotten that he didn't destroy Trump's property, but rather, the state of California's. Making matters worse for himself, Otis states that he intends to sell the plaques taken from the star on election day, claiming he will donate all the money to Trump's so-called sexual assault victims. 
Unfortunately for him, the more he talked, the more trouble he got himself into. After all, most people know that selling or buying stolen property is a criminal offense as well. We all know that Hillary Clinton's voters aren't the smartest in society, but this guy may just take the cake. Then again, he'll have plenty of time to think about how dumb he is while he's pissing his life away behind bars.

Criminal Minions CAUGHT Pushing Voter Fraud To Get Hillary Elected Posted on October 26, 2016 by Shae Weatherall in Politics  
There isn't anything that Hillary Clinton supporters won't stoop to do or say in order to get their candidate elected. We've seen massive amounts of corruption involving every level of Hillary's minions all the way up to the Chair of the Democratic National Committee. Apparently, nothing is off limits when they're doing Hillary's bidding, and now they have a new racket that is going to make criminal voter fraud a whole lot easier. 
Election fraud has already become a big concern again this election cycle as voting machines are reportedly 'malfunctioning' and switching votes in favor of Hillary. One Texas county was even forced to abandon the machines altogether and go to paper ballots. 
There has been some progress in protecting the integrity of our elections by implementing voter ID laws, but Democrats have been fighting it tooth and nail. Hillary and her minions claim that it's racist or oppressive or some crap to expect United States citizens to possess and show picture ID to vote. It's apparently not a problem, though, to ask them to show ID for a pack of cigarettes or to board a plane or for a hundred other things. Go figure. 
Even as they were whining about how requiring photo identification to vote is oppression, Hillary's minions were already working on a solution. They knew there was a good chance they would lose the fight against states who wanted to stop dead 'Democrats' from voting, and so now, we're seeing the Hillary supporters' machine at work. 
Hillary's minions have taken to the internet to advertise and sell near-perfect replicas of state driver's licenses. According to an ad on craigslist which has now been removed, the entire purpose of purchasing one of the fake ID's is specifically to fraudulently vote for Hillary Clinton . 
The text on the ad reads: ' I can provide you with a high-quality fake ID it comes with holographic and also barcode [sic]. This can be used anywhere, we are offering special deals for people who will go to the polls on November 8th, we need to get Hillary in office . We only meet in a public location and accept cash only no trades. All states, cities, and addresses available. Buy 2 get 1 free. Election special free IDs* ( you have no say as to information on these, they are already pre-populated and must be used to vote on Nov. 8th) ' Screenshot captured before removal of Craigslist ad for Fake IDs. ' Fake IDs Let's Get Hillary Elected – $1 (Detroit). ' Lower portion of screenshot captured before removal of Craigslist ad for Fake IDs. ' Fake IDs Let's Get Hillary Elected – $1 (Detroit). ' Larger view of photo included in the Craigslist ad. selling forged driver's licenses. ' Fake IDs Let's Get Hillary Elected – $1 (Detroit) .' Notice how the same face is used to create several IDs from varying states. 
It's extremely disturbing to hear over and over again about the lengths to which Democrats and Hillary and her minions (including the liberal media) will go in order to try to secure her election as president. Have they no shame, pride, or confidence at all? Maybe they all realize — like the rest of us do — that Hillary really is that awful of a person , in every possible way, and the only chance she has to get into the White House as president is to steal the election . They must know it. Otherwise, why would they try to hard to use fraud and corruption to get her there? 
If true-blue, red-blooded Americans have anything to say about it — and we most certainly do — Hillary 'Rotten' Clinton is not moving back in our house at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. We now know that during the years and even decades that we've suspected mass corruption and fraud within the Democrat Party, we were right and we will never be fooled again.

 An 87-year-old man was beaten nearly to death after giving a ride to a migrant. 
A sweet 87-year-old man offered a young migrant a ride to the train station, hoping to show him a small act of kindness. However, as soon as they pulled up to his stop, the migrant thug attacked the elderly man, beating him to a bloody pulp and punching a hole in his eye after he made one simple request. 
An elderly Swede saw just how far tolerance and open-mindedness reaches with other cultures after giving a 27-year-old Colombian migrant a ride from Gnosjö to Gislaved. Graciously obliging the Hispanic migrant, the old man and his wife took him 20 minutes away to the local train station. Unfortunately, the pensioner made a nearly fatal mistake when they arrived at their destination. 
According to Fria Tider , the 87-year-old unnamed man pulled up to the station and politely told the migrant that they had arrived at his destination. Simply informing the foreigner that it was time to exit the vehicle apparently sent him into a rage, causing him to brutally beat the driver almost to death. 
Repeatedly punching him in the torso and head at least a dozen times, the migrant beat the old man so badly that he broke his rib and punched a hole in his right eye, damage that was so extensive that doctors worried he would go completely blind even after 3 weeks in the hospital. 
'He can no longer read newspapers or see on television,' according to the court report. 'It is unclear if he will ever see again. Before the beating, he was alert and active in the community. Now, he needs the help of four times a day.' 
When police arrested the migrant, whose identity is protected by the liberal Swedish government, he told authorities that his victim had sparked the beating by calling him 'little' and a 'negro.' It wasn't long before the thug admitted that he lied about the accusations and simply beat the sweet old man because he knew he'd get away with it. 
The convict laughed during his interrogation, telling police that he was amused that a man just over 5 feet tall could take down a feeble, elderly man a foot taller. 'It is what it is,' the migrant heckled. 'A man of 6 feet getting knocked out — me leveling a man of 6-feet is really laughable. I cut him down like a tree,' he added, telling police that it doesn't matter if he's convicted because 'I'll be on the loose. I will come out soon again. You can't lock me up for very long,' according to Expressen . Left-leaning Swedish authorities protect the identity of the migrant thug, forcing the media to censor his face and the Colombian flag patch on his jacket. 
Sickeningly enough, the migrant thug was right. Thanks to the politically correct justice system, he received just over 2 years in prison for aggravated assault, a sentence that will likely either be appealed, overturned, or reduced with good behavior. In fact, his appeal is currently being heard by a higher court, which is considering reducing his sentence based because he was located on social media and forced to go into hiding because of his brutal crime. 
Unfortunately, this type of racially-motivated violence is nothing new to Europe. Just over a week ago, Mad World News reported that a group of 5 white men, 3 U.S. citizens and 2 Danes, were approached by 8 to 10 Muslim migrants who asked if they were Americans. When the 3 admitted that they are, the asylum seekers attacked all 5 of them, brutally beating and threatening to kill them with a knife. 
The victims received no help from the Danish government and have been ignored by local authorities. Even the central investigating police headquarters refused to take the case. 
As the elderly Swedish man discovered, it doesn't matter if you extend tolerance and respect, many of these migrants see Westerners as inferior humans who must be forced to submit. This is exactly what a bleeding-heart liberal found out after volunteering at the Calais 'Jungle' camp. 
Last week, Mad World News reported that a 38-year-old female interpreter was helping a male journalist make a documentary about the plight of migrants when a group of 3 Afghan asylum seekers attacked them at knifepoint. One of the migrants raped her while the others restrained the journalist and stole his equipment. 
Those who despise our culture, values, and laws won't have a change of heart when we show them just how progressive and open-minded our society is. They know this, and it's the very reason they hate us. In fact, they see our kindness as an opportunity to impose their oppressive and violent values on us without fear of being opposed. After all, we wouldn't want to be considered racist, would we?

Obama Furious After Fed-Up 'Deplorables' Drop 41,000-Piece Gift On Him   Amanda Shea   Pissed off Patriots (left), Barack Obama deplaning Air Force One (right) 
Barack Obama was at home in the White House when he received a little 'gift' from Donald Trump's fed-up 'deplorables,' who interrupted his taxpayer-funded rest and relaxation with 41,000 things he never saw coming. These blunt patriots weren't messing around, and they sent a clear message to our lame duck president, who didn't like it at all. 
The leader of the free world hasn't done much in his two terms of trying, and he's not about to start now on his way out of office. He has taken the liberty of awarding himself substantial tee time, only reserving his efforts and energy to promote who he hopes to be his successor, Hillary Clinton. As annoying at it is to watch him do nothing, it's worse to see him take a side to campaign with one candidate while slandering the other, which Donald Trump's supporters have noticed and are fed-up over it. 
There's a war happening on our own soil, between sharply divided citizens who are sick of seeing democracy destroyed during this election. While Hillary has everyone from the mainstream media to our president in her pantsuit pocket, patriots are expected to just accept it, along with the skewed results — and don't want to pay a single dime for our president to spit in our faces any longer as he promotes Hillary on our hard-earned tax money. 
A petition started on StandUnited has received 41,000 signatures from frustrated patriots who are asking Congress to stop paying our president as he plays favorites in campaigning for Hillary. ' We the People demand that Congress withhold President Obama's salary, pension, travel expenses, etc. for any time he spends actively campaigning for Hillary Clinton between now and the election in November,' the petition on conservative site states. 
While it's not unusual for the current president to endorse a candidate on their way out of the White House, 'Rarely, however, does that same lame duck President spend weeks or even months prior to the November election actively campaigning for his successor,' the petition laments. 
Considering Obama's salary of about $400,000 a year and the cost of Air Force One at $180,000 for every single hour of flight, the amount he's siphoning from an already strained budget for a candidate that a mass amount of Americans don't want in office is astronomical and insulting. Congress probably doesn't even care about the cash or true conservatives and their petition, since the establishment is for keeping things how they want it at the cost of this Republican candidate who could better the country with change we need.

Part 4 Of O'Keefe's Project Veritas Videos Has Americans Asking 1 Question   Rebecca Diserio   
The fourth part of James O'Keefe's Project Veritas year-long sting operation was just posted today, and it's shaken Hillary Clinton's campaign in more ways than one. You'll be shocked to learn more ways these Democrat thugs attempted to rig our election, taking illegal money and committing serious crimes that all point right back to Hillary. Pissed off Americans are now left asking just one question. Democratic thug Scott Foval 
Robert Creamer, who has visited the White House over 300 times and met personally with Barack Obama 47 times, was caught in an undercover sting operation, illegally taking $20,000 for Hillary Clinton's campaign from a 'foreign donor' who was really an undercover journalist for Project Veritas, but it gets worse. 
Project Veritas decided to give them the illegal contribution from a bank account that they set up in Belize to prove to Creamer they were not plants and to get Creamer to trust the Project Veritas journalist. Knowing Creamer was in deep, doing dirty deals for Hillary Clinton, it was worth risking the 20 grand, and at the very least, they busted the Democrat operatives taking an illegal donation. 
Creamer took the bait in the form of 20 grand, and it gave the Project Veritas journalist access to all of the other lower level Democratic operatives who then confided all of their dirty dealings. Democratic operative dirty deal man Bob Creamer & his wife Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D-Illinois) 
Creamer spilled the beans, linking him directly to Hillary's campaign, which is totally illegal under campaign finance laws. Plus, in earlier videos, Creamer was exposed for being guilty of inciting violence at Trump rallies and potential voter fraud schemes. Here's Creamer talking, not knowing he is being recorded: 
'Every morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters … I am in this campaign mainly to deal with what earned media with television, radio, with earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising.' He also mentions a conference call discussing a woman potentially coming forward to accuse Trump of inappropriate behavior . [via Breitbart ] 
Did you get that last sentence? He threw in there that he would be discussing another woman who they knew in advance was going to coming forward to accuse Donald Trump. That's highly suspicious, to say the least. How would this guy, Creamer, know in advance about something like that? 
Elsewhere in the video , Creamer adds, 'I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the… the health care bill, for trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues. ' 
Look, so far, there are so many counts of illegal activity exposed here that the majority of comments from the American people are demanding an answer to one question: Where in the hell is the FBI? 
Creamer is a major player who meets with the president 47 times and runs dirty operations for Hillary Clinton. He has taken 20 grand from an illegal foreign donor, which they give back after they find out Project Veritas busted them in a sting, but that doesn't make it go away nor does it make any of the other crimes they have committed for Hillary go away either. 
It's time for the FBI to step up and do some law enforcing. Even if Obama continues to shield Hillary Clinton, a criminal who cannot be president, that doesn't make these crimes go away. Just wait until Donald Trump wins this election — all of these criminals in Washington will pay.

Trump Catches What Sick Reporter Snuck In Interview, Has Priceless Response Posted on October 27, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  CNN's Dana Bash (left), Bash Interviewing Donald Trump (right) 
Donald Trump stopped campaigning for just an hour-and-half to work in a brief appearance at the opening of his new hotel, whereÂ reporters awaited his arrival â one of which had a nasty surprise hidden up her sleeve. When the Republican candidate caught it mid-interview on live television, he had a priceless response that the CNN crank won't soon forget. 
Liberal news host Dana Bash is evidently no fan of Donald Trump, which she's not afraid to show in her biased reporting. Her arrogance backfired when she was in front of him at the grand opening of his hotel, thinking she could get away with a public attempt to insult him, but she got rightfully put in her place by the blunt candidate. 
Trump's schedule is jam packed with as many campaign stops as he can cram into these final weeks of the election, taking advantage of every waking moment to earn Americans' votes. Somehow in the middle of his traveling to every corner of the country, he managed to squeeze in a stop at his hotel's grand opening where he created countless jobs and a structure he should be proud of. However, Bash didn't see it this way in her attempt to slam him for this 90-minute 'time off' he was taking from campaigning. 
During her live interview at the opening, the nasty CNN reporter had the audacity to sneak in this question: 'For people who say youâre taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?' She painted this pit stop as an irresponsible thing to do while Hillary Clinton is working hard. Trump shuts down Dana Bash after questioning him for "taking time off" to attend his hotel's grand opening. đ pic.twitter.com/LtLAu1jkbQ 
— Deplorable AJ (@asamjulian) October 26, 2016 
Trump wasn't going to allow her to get away with asking such a disgusting thing, given the vast difference in effort between him and his opponent and didn't mince a single word in his priceless answer. 
'I say the following. You have been covering me for the last, long time. I did yesterday 8 stops and 3 major speeches. And Iâve been doing this for weeks straight. I left for here for an hour-and-a-half. Iâm leaving here and going to North Carolina, then Iâm going to Florida, then Iâm going up to New Hampshire. For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then goes home and sleeps. And yet you ask me that question. I think itâs a very rude question .' 
Bash didn't see that coming, and Trump proved once again why America needs an unapologetic leader like him. He tells it how it is and backs up what he says with real action, unlike his competition who puts in a couple of days of campaigning and calls it good since it's all for show anyway. 
Trump is putting in ten times the effort with genuine work ethic on his own dime to honestly earn the votes, and if he wants to take a couple of minutes to make an appearance at an opening, he's more than entitled to do it. It pales in comparison to the weeks Hillary has had off relaxing and recovering. Trump's creating jobs as he's campaigning, but Hillary's just napping.

Hillary Abruptly Stops At Rally, Couldn't Hide What Happened Seconds Later Posted on October 27, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics  
While speaking at her latest rally in Florida, Hillary Clinton's speech took an abrupt turn as she just stopped in the middle of a sentence. Unfortunately for her, what happened just seconds later was all caught on tape – and she couldn't hide it. 
Despite what she would have you believe, Hillary is not as healthy as she claims. As we've seen strange eye movements that hint toward Parkinson's disease and an ever increasing difficulty to get up or down a flight of stairs , it's safe to say she won't make it 4 years in our White House. Hillary Clinton 
However, her most recent stunt has set a few people on edge as it goes to show that she's suffering from more than just physical impairments. According to The American Mirror , the female presidential hopeful suffered an embarrassing moment as her brain seemingly froze mid-sentence. 
All caught on video, Hillary was speaking in Lake Worth, Florida on the topic of solar energy when the crowd started to cheer. At that moment, Hillary stopped dead in her tracks and tried to stutter through her thoughts. 
'They're not exactly known as the sunshine states,' Clinton said. 'There's a lot of great things about those states, but think about the jobs that can be created, as well as contributing to what we need to do together to save…' she said before awkwardly pausing and finally adding, '…our country and the world.' 
Unfortunately for her, not even she could hide the embarrassing brain freeze as it was all caught on camera. Although some people are saying she may have been distracted, that doesn't seem to be the case as it has happened before. 
In fact, there is also footage of the last ordeal that took place before she gained the nomination. While speaking at a rally where she was attacking Bernie Sanders, a similarly embarrassing series of events played out: 
Many people have been saying how Hillary's brain isn't quite up to par, but we're seeing more and more of it as her campaign progresses. She has been in the campaign spotlight for about a year now, and America is starting to catch on to her dirty little secret. 
If she can't handle one year on the campaign trail, how is she going to look in another few years after suffering the abuse that a presidential term comes with? Any responsible person would have dropped out long ago – like maybe, the first time she literally dropped in the streets at the 9/11 memorial event in New York City. 
It just goes to show how far this woman is willing to go in her pursuit of power. Let's just hope that Donald Trump shuts her down in November before she can do our nation any more harm.

Hillary Arrives At Rally, Makes One Weird Move That Left Onlookers Puzzled Posted on October 27, 2016 by Alisha Rich in Politics  
As Hillary Clinton makes her last few rounds of appearances before election day, the presidential hopeful will feel a little bit of the pressure that the presidency will demand. However, when she arrived at her rally in Lake Worth, Florida, she attempted to make one move that she hoped no one would notice. 
There have been many questions over the course of Hillary Clinton's campaign regarding her health. As a result of her age and her lifestyle, there's no doubt that her body is starting to feel the effects of aging – whether she likes to admit it or not. 
However, video footage of her recent rally in Florida shows how desperate she is to keep her health problems hidden, but her attempt was met with failure the moment she hit the stage. In fact, the Democratic presidential candidate struggled to climb one single step. The video captures one of her aides rushing towards her side as she attempted to climb up the riser. 
'She needed assistance to get onto it as she could be seen reaching her hand out for a boost or some added steadiness,' according to The American Mirror . 'The aide extended his hand and Clinton held on tightly as she made her way up the 18 inches.' 
Although Hillary Clinton insists that her health isn't an issue, the number of incidents she has had paints quite a different picture. If you take a close look at the video, the aide can even be seen standing behind her, reaching for her waist – probably preparing for the event of her falling. 
We have said it time and time again – she's not fit to be president. Although her health is a major concern considering how demanding the presidency can be on a person, it's her disastrous political history that raises, even more, concerns.

Hillary Clinton's campaign is struggling after receiving blow after blow recently, even though the mainstream media would have us believe otherwise. As if the WikiLeaks dumps and Project Veritas videos weren't doing enough damage, private photos have begun circling the internet, and once you see them, it's easy to understand why they are destroying Hillary's presidential dreams. 
Unlike other leaks and sting operations, the private photos cropping up all across social media impact all voters in a way they can't deny. Contrary to what you may be thinking, the images aren't Hillary's private photographs, but rather, private snapshots her voters have taken that now have the   looking incredibly foolish. 
News was recently released that Obamacare premiums will soar in the coming year, just as many conservatives predicted and warned. The 2017 increase is reported to be an average of 25% for the most popular plans, as the 'Affordable' Care Act continues to rely on older, sicker customers than its architects and backers had anticipated, IJR explains. However, it's not just the Obamacare plans that are seeing a hike in premium costs. It seems to be happening to everyone, and many social media users took to Facebook to give a glimpse of the crippling damage being done to their finances. 
With a quick search of the social media site, I was able to find more than a handful of photos that upset Americans have posted, showing their premium increases for 2017, and in many cases, it was much more than the already dreaded 25%. Have a look at the prices Americans will be paying next year: 
This is what Hillary Clinton believes she can 'fix.' My question is, how many families will be broke, bankrupt, or even homeless because of these crippling premiums before that ever happens if it ever happens? Maybe families who can't afford it could just skip having health insurance — except that results in a financially devastating fine and, God forbid, should they need medical care, they are out of luck. 
Even Hillary's own husband, former President Bill Clinton, bashes Obamacare as a disaster while campaigning for his wife . While Bill was campaigning for Hillary in Goldsboro, North Carolina, on Tuesday, he listed all the problems with Obamacare. 'One of the problems with a law, we can all tick them off, right?' Bill began. ' The copays, deductibles, and premiums are too high, and the drug prices are too high. So, what does she say we should do? We should bargain for lower drug prices, the way that government can't now with Medicare and Medicaid for everybody.' Bill Clinton says Obamacare has a "list" of problems: "The copays, deductibles, and premiums are too high." https://t.co/jyvhYS4zXr 
— Republican Policy (@SenateRPC) October 26, 2016 
Unlike Bill, Hillary has not only defended but praised Obamacare , refusing to admit that it needs to be repealed. She's even gone as far as to tout it as Hillycare . Obamacare — or Hillarycare, if she prefers — has been a disaster for millions of Americans as their premiums, deductibles, and copays all increase while less and less of their health care needs seem to be covered. 
But, don't take my word for it. Before casting your vote on November 8 for someone calling Obamacare a 'success,' I encourage you to check with your insurance company to see what your premiums, deductibles, and copays will be in 2017. Hillary has already warned us, 'I've fought for quality, affordable healthcare my entire career. As president, I'll defend the Affordable Care Act , build on its successes, and go even further to reduce costs.' The problems she's ignoring is that it's not affordable, it's far from a success, and it hasn't reduced costs. 
That statement alone should be enough to have the majority of Americans unwilling to cast a vote in her direction, and if they find out their premiums for 2017 before November 8, that's going to ring even truer. So, the next time you hear a Hillary supporter excitedly ready to vote, tell them to make that one call. Find out what their insurance will look like under a Hillary presidency. As they say, money talks, bullshit walks. When her supporters find out how much Hillary will cost them, hopefully, they'll walk too.

Humiliated Hillary Tries To Hide What Camera Caught 15 Mins Before Rally Posted on October 27, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  Hillary Clinton outside rally (left), Fox News catching incident on live feed (right) 
Both presidential candidates stopped in the battleground state of Florida this week to campaign for votes to crowds at separate locations. However, things didn't go so well for Hillary Clinton, who was humiliated when a camera caught what she immediately tried to hide to save her campaign — which backfired big time. 
While Donald Trump's 15,000-person army of 'Deplorables' were holding down the fort in Stanford, Florida as they listened to this great leader explain how he plans to make America great again, Hillary was at a much smaller venue at Palm Beach State College. Although she was feeling pretty good about herself with having a higher turnout than she's used to, the approximate 1,000 to 2,000 attendees paled in comparison to what Trump was looking at in the same state. However, Hillary's anemic crowd was enough to be publicly mocked in front of. 
Perhaps Hillary didn't think anyone would notice, but Fox Business Network was watching — and commenting — live. With just fifteen minutes before the Democratic candidate was set to take the stage in one of her final and most important rallies, the small room should have been jam-packed with people. As the humored hosts noted on the news show, that was far from the case. 
'Here it is nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in Sanford, Florida yesterday for Mr. Trump, 15,000. There's maybe a thousand to two thousand people here today,' one host pointed out much to Hillary's embarrassment. 'The Clinton rallies tend to be much smaller and you can see there's empty space here and she's supposed to speak in 15 minutes. And I can tell you that as the camera pans across that if we were at a Trump rally this would absolutely be packed,' the commentators added. 
No matter how far ahead in the polls Hillary and her lapdog media says she is, the attendance at her events speaks volumes. Nobody cares or is enthusiastic enough about this woman to bother showing up, and those who do have to be coached on how to chant and act excited. 
On the other hand, there are Trump's rallies, where so many people turn up to venues four times the size as Hillary's that these massive stadiums can't contain everyone who is eager to come, and some are turned away. If the turnout at the rallies is any indicator of what's expected at the polls, Hillary can't win, and if she does, Americans should definitely question how that could even happen

 Residents were fed up with hearing the Islamic call to prayer blasting at 5 a.m. each morning, so Mayor Yair Revivo decided to give the Muslim community a taste of their own medicine. 
Although citizens were fed up, they were too afraid to call out a Muslim community for disturbing the peace by blasting their call to prayer in the early morning hours. However, as soon as the mayor heard what was happening, he decided to give the Muslims a taste of their own medicine. 
Regardless of which country Muslims infiltrate, they eventually overtake the politically correct majority with their incessant demands, compulsive behavior, and intimidating tactics. Unfortunately, even the last Jewish state on earth is slowly being driven out of their own land after millennia of thriving under religious persecution. 
As the only democracy in the Middle East, Israel is the only country in which Muslims and Jews can live free — that is, as long as the Muslim community is kept under strict control. Exacting the same racism, religious persecution, and terrorism they commit in every country to which they migrate, even the ever-progressing Jewish nation is finding it impossible to coexist with such barbarity. In an attempt to establish their religion as supreme, the Muslim community in Lod (Lydda) has been blasting the adhan, unconcerned with the non-Muslim population it disturbs and intimidates. 
Fortunately, there are still those who are willing to buck political correctness to stand against this bigotry. Hamodia reports that, in an attempt to combat the blatantly disruptive calls to prayer, Mayor Yair Revivo announced a new program to the city on Tuesday night. 
The Jewish leader has vowed that since the Muslims are blaring their adhan and refusing to turn it down to an acceptable volume, the city will blast the Jewish song 'Shem Yisrael' at the same time. 
Aryeh Levi, a member of the city council, has begun singing the beautiful rendition of the Jewish prayer over loudspeakers, completely drowning out the unbearable adhan. Because the local Muslims were given chances to quiet their call to prayer but repeatedly refused, the Jewish community is invoking their country's religious heritage to 'fight fire with fire.' 
Revivo explained that the new program has nothing to do with Judaism or Islam but peace and quiet. Muslims pray 5 times a day, but the first call to prayer is around an hour and a half before sunrise, which is often as early as 5 a.m. Undeniably, this is incredibly disturbing for non-Muslim residents, especially those living closer to the mosques. 
In a statement, Revivo's office said that 'the use of loudspeakers for the call to prayer has over time turned into a national phenomenon, and causes much suffering and annoyance for residents, who are awakened from their slumber in the early morning hours and are subject to the call several times a day. Both Jews and Muslims who live near mosques have complained about the noise. The city has tried to limit this phenomenon using legal means, as the call to prayer is a serious violation of laws against noise, but so far we have been unsuccessful.' 
Lod is home to 45,000 Jews and 21,000 Arabs, however, it is the religious minority that repeatedly terrorizes their hosts. Whether by noise pollution or old-fashioned Islamic terrorism, Muslims in Israel are attempting to overthrow democracy and freedom for Sharia. If this happens, history shows us that the Jews will again be oppressed, executed, and exiled, just as the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled when he invaded and butchered the peaceful Jewish tribes of Medina . 
According to the Times of Israel , Revivo, who is Jewish, said Lod 'would be an Arab city today if not for the garin torani — a group of religious Zionists who began working in Lod 20 years ago to strengthen Jewish identity there. 
Of course, Muslims immediately resorted to whining, angrily disputing being subjected to the same annoyance they create for others. 
Abed el Karim Azbargeh, an Arab member of the city council, said Revivo had chosen a Jewish religious celebration for 'cheap politics' and had acted in a 'disgusting and irresponsible' way. 
Muslims look us in the eyes and swear that 'there is no compulsion in religion' while blasting the mandatory call for their mandatory prayers. Then, they demand special food, breaks, clothing, holidays, and other amenities at the expense of others. Unfortunately, appeasing these inherently violent worshipers does nothing but speed up their goal of establishing an Islamic state. Once they become powerful or numerous enough, the rest of the populace is too afraid to speak out.

Conspiracy Theorists' Believe They've Found Justice Scalia's MURDER Plot Posted on October 27, 2016 by Dawn Parabellum in Politics  
It's troubling to uncover the dirty secrets in the emails leaked from John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, and it just keeps getting worse. Since the mainstream media refuses to do it, many 'conspiracy theorists' are investigating for themselves, and internet sleuths believe they've uncovered the murder plot of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Unsurprisingly, the Clintons may have even more blood on their hands. Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia. 
The evidence does look damning. In the email, where coded language and a disjointed writing technique was used, Podesta is offered a 'script' to a 'movie.' However, that's the only normal part of this email. 
The script writer of the movie is asking Podesta to fund the film, which right away makes the exchange odd since the movie isn't political and Podesta is Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, not a movie investor. It seems even more strange once the plot of the movie is revealed in the emails as well. What's worse, this is not the first email thought to be about the assassination of Antonin Scalia, but I digress. 
The movie is about a 'Mexican' girl on a journey to find her mother. She crosses paths with a man named Alex who assists her on her journey. They end up at an isolated ranch house with a massive underground tunnel in Tecate, California. There is a Smithsonian map included in a link, which has a line pointing to the 'setting' of the film, as seen below. Map included in the Podesta emails showing the 'setting' of the 'movie' 
The map seems inconspicuous enough until it was realized that the pointer of the map is showing the exact location of the Cibolo Ranch where Antonin Scalia died. Below is a Google map showing the location of the Cibolo Ranch. Google map depicting the location of the Cibolo Ranch 
The maps were enough to draw the attention of internet sleuths. Digging deeper, they have uncovered more in the same email discussing the details of this 'movie,' and honestly, it doesn't feel right. The entire script of the 'movie' can be read in the leaked emails , but one part stands out in addition to connecting the dots with the maps. Ronald Reagan is discussed for some strange reason 
It's difficult to imagine what President Ronald Reagan has to do with a movie about a Mexican woman's journey, other than the fact that Antonin Scalia was a Reagan appointee. However, it gets a little more creepy further down the slightly discombobulated email. A portion of the lengthy email conspiracy theorists believe details the murder plot of Antonin Scalia 
His five 'film projects' aren't detailed. All he says are 'two are political, one is spiritual, and two are just for fun.' Conspiracy theorists believe this is a list of his assassinations and the best way to describe who has been killed and why. 
Could this all be an elaborate movie and the email sender a poor writer? That seems unlikely, considering he's claiming to have written an entire script. But, could conspiracy theorists have jumped the gun? That's also possible. 
There's still no absolute proof that this is the murder plot of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, but with just over one week left until the nation decides who will be the president and Wikileaks still having many more John Podesta emails to release, it's possible we may see more about this 'movie' if that's what was really being discussed.

A police officer in Hope, Indiana was dispatched to an unusual car in a Dollar General parking lot. Much to his surprise, he found 25-year-old Erika Hurt unconscious with her body slumped in the front seat and her head tilted back. However, the situation would soon turn to horror when the police officer saw what was in the driver's hand — and it was only made worse as he looked in the backseat. Erika Hurt 
Unfortunately, the situation took a dark turn as soon as the officer opened the car door and saw what the woman was clutching onto — a heroin needle still in Hurt's hand. The situation was only be made worse when he looked in the backseat to see the woman's 10-month-old baby sitting there all alone, crying. 
Officers say that Hurt had overdosed on the drug and, after being revived by police, was quickly rushed to an area hospital where she is recovering. Since that time, Hurt has officially been charged with child neglect and possession of drug paraphernalia. Heroin needle still in Erika Hurt's hand 
The troubling images were released to the public, and although most people understand why Town Marshal Matthew Tallent shared the image, a few naysayers have expressed their belief that it was inappropriate to show a woman in such a condition – but this isn't one man you want to mess with. 
'I'm trying to show people that this just isn't a city problem. The heroin epidemic is leaking into small town America and it's getting really bad,' he told Mail Online . 'Not only did this woman overdose and nearly die but, had she not passed out from the drug, she would have driven out of the car park and could still have been driving while passed out or under the influence. She could have killed another innocent family.' 
Fortunately, Tallent did inform the public that the child was physically unharmed, but as he noted, things could have ended much differently. The drug problem here in America is very serious, and we're seeing it seep into the crack and crevasses of every small town in our nation at this point. 
If ever there was an argument to better secure our border, this would be it. If I've learned one thing in this world, it's that you can't help anyone who doesn't want to help themselves. With that being said, though, a lot fewer people would need such help if these drugs weren't so easily making their way into this country. Build that wall, Mr. Trump.

 Abdul Barati, a 43-yera-old Afghan migrant, was arrested after investigators noticed something sinister about his house fire. 
When neighbors awoke to strange noises and the smell of smoke coming from a Muslim family's house, they quickly rushed over to see what was happening. However, as soon as they looked in the window, they immediately notified the authorities of the unspeakable horror they witnessed. 
No matter what heinous crimes Muslims commit, there is always a leftist more concerned with preserving the already unsalvageable reputation of the religion that demands their submission. So, when a Muslim man carried out his gruesome plans in the middle of a suburban neighborhood in Australia, his neighbors were 'shocked' to find that an adherent of the world's most deadly religion could be so barbaric. 
The Daily Telegraph reports that Sydney residents awoke at 3:35 a.m. on October 18 to blood-curdling screams and thick smoke filling the air. They rushed outside to find Abdul Barati, a 43-year-old Afghan migrant, using water from a tap in a half-hearted attempt to extinguish a massive blaze tearing through his home. Instantly, their eyes were drawn to the bedroom window where his wife, 30-year-old Adelah, was banging on the pane and screaming in agony as she slowly burned to death. 
Desperately scrambling to save her life, neighbors told Abdul that they were going to try to help get his wife out of the house. Almost nonchalantly, he told them everything was 'fine' and that he didn't need their assistance except to call the fire department. It was not long after horrified residents were forced to watch the last few seconds of Abelah's life that they realized this was all part of Abdul's plan. 
After the fire department quenched the flames, Abdul was arrested and charged with murder. Investigators quickly discovered that the migrant had locked his young wife in their bedroom, removed their 6-year-old and 9-year-old sons, and set the property on fire, the Daily Mail reports. Abdul then pretended to fight the blaze as petrified onlookers watched his poor wife burn to death. Even more appalling is that the two children were also on the front lawn watching their mother engulfed in flames. Neighbors and the Baratis' two young sons, aged 6 and 9, helplessly watched Adelah burn to death through the bedroom window. 
'There's a lady screaming, but when my husband arrived to wake her up the screaming stopped already,' Manni Chen told Channel 9, according to News.com.au . 'My husband tried to help the man, he said 'do you need help?' he said 'no, no, no, just call the fire station' and then my husband said 'let the two kids get out' and the man said 'no we are fine.' The man tried to use a water tap to get the fire down, but he just told my husband call the fire station.' 
We expect liberal apologists to come out in full force, either excusing this behavior as the fault of 'mental illness' or blatantly denying its ties to Islam. Of course, if this had happened in a Sharia country instead of Australia, things would play out much differently. 
Earlier this month, a Pakistani Muslim father pardoned himself for the murder of his daughter after the Sharia court found him guilty of honor killing the young woman. In accordance with the country's Islamic law, Faqeer Muhammad was granted acquittal after shooting and killing Kiran Bibi and Ghulam Abbas for their unapproved relationship, according to the Daily Pakistan . 
According to the Sharia legislature, a murderer can be completely pardoned of his crime if the family of the victim forgives and excuses them. In many cases such as this, the family members are able to pardon themselves for killing their dishonorable kin. 
'The deceased, Kiran Bibi, was my real daughter. She was a spinster at the time of her murder. There are no other legal heirs of the deceased except her mother, Bushra Bibi, and me,' Muhammad told the court. 'I have forgiven the accused persons in the name of Almighty Allah, and have no objection to their acquittal. I also waive my right of Qisas (retribution) and Diyat (blood money).' 
Although legislation passed in 2015 outlaws the pardoning of murderers in honor killings, Islamic law reigns supreme in Pakistan, still allowing many Muslim killers to walk scot-free. 
Further proving the violent nature of Islam, fathers who murder their own children without a good Islamic reason are given more brutal sentences. At the same time as Muhammad was pardoning himself, Khalid Mehmood was sentenced to death for killing his 12-year-old daughter for not being able to make perfect bread. If only Mehmood would've told the court that he murdered the child for cursing Allah, he could've pardoned himself as well. 
Good Muslims cannot coexist anywhere in the world because as long as they are trying to follow their religion, they must call for the destruction of all other laws, religions, and cultures until their ideology reigns supreme. It's nothing short of incredible that so many Westerners still find it shocking when they do just what the Quran commands.

Camera Catches Hillary's Sick Hidden Message To Christian Voters Posted on October 27, 2016 by Prissy Holly in Politics  
Democrats are constantly attacking Christianity while makingÂ their disdain for anything holy abundantly clear. Evidence of their godless agenda was on full display during the Democratic National convention, when they removed all references to God. It should come as no surpriseÂ what Hillary was caught doing at a campaign event, which clearlyÂ solidifies the true evil nature of the Democratic Party. 
Like it or not, our country was founded on Christian principles. 'In God we trust' is not only printed on all of our currency, but references to God areÂ throughout the Constitution, as our Founding Fathers intertwined their faith with our founding documents. Liberals loathe this fact,Â and many have made it their life mission to erase God from everything in our country, as evidenced by their constant barrage on our faith. 
At a Democratic presidential rally in May, one of Hillary's little evil minions took the stage to introduce Hillary to the crowd. But when the unnamed woman began using lines of ourÂ Pledge of Allegiance to weave withÂ her pro-Hillary rhetoric, she decided to omit two little words, as a blatant slap in the face to God. 
âOnly Hillary can bring us together as one nationâŚ UndâŚ Indivisible, with liberty and justice for all,â the woman said, while partially quoting the US Pledge of Allegiance. 
This demented woman intentionally removed 'under God' from our nation's pledge, but how Hillary reacted was even more disturbing, as she immediately begins to nod and smile inÂ agreement of this woman's omission. Watch her choke on "Under God"&"indivisible" 
— NEEDYđLatina4Trump (@tteegar) October 25, 2016 
How sickening.Â Liberals will not be fully satisfied until they completely destroy our country with their vile agenda. If Hillary gets elected, we'll soon have the most godless and corrupt person on the planet driving our country even further downÂ the path ofÂ darkness and destruction. 
At this point in our nation's history, it's imperative that we don't just sit idly by and allow these things to go on. We have to get loud and aggressively fight back when we see darkness slipping in, whether that be at our children's schools, in our government, orÂ in our presidential candidates.

Don't be deceived by Hillary Clinton's lie that she'll fix Obamacare. She already tried to fix healthcare in 1994 when President Bill Clinton put her in charge of transforming our healthcare and insurance plans. She called it Hillarycare, and like Obamacare, it failed miserably. Now, her plans for Obamacare have been exposed — along with how millions of Americans will end up dead thanks to her 'fix.' 
Hillary Clinton is a very dangerous woman. The one thing that scares healthcare professionals is her plans to fix Obamacare, which is falling apart with premiums going through the roof. It was always going to fail. 
As a Registered Nurse for over 20 years, working in the inner city in Los Angeles, I saw firsthand how health care works. When Barack Obama and his Democratic minions passed Obamacare in 2010, I freaked out, knowing this would bring untimely deaths to many of my fellow Americans, and now that Hillary says she'll fix Obamacare, I can be silent no more. Hillary promises to fix Obamacare with full blown socialized medicine 
The first thing you need to realize is that Obamacare was never the ultimate plan. It was meant to be a step toward total socialized medicine. Hillary will put Obamacare on steroids, and the goal is for a complete government controlled system that every American is enrolled in, where that is the only choice you have. 
This is the same system that plagues Canada and Great Britain, and it means Americans will die. Instead of your doctor deciding what type of care you get, there are strict guidelines which all doctors must follow. If you are a woman diagnosed with ovarian cancer, you will only be given one path to take. You will not be allowed to find out about cutting edge drugs or treatments. You will be sent home to die. Kathleen Sebelius said, under Obamacare, 'someone lives and someone dies.' 
Under socialized medicine, it's all about cost effectiveness, and ovarian cancer has a high death rate. So, you're not worth the expensive treatment that may cure you or help you live longer. You won't even know those treatments exist. They'll pat you on the head, say how sorry they are, and tell you that they will do everything they can to keep you 'comfortable.' 
This won't affect the ultra-rich. This will affect the lower and middle class, who can't afford to seek treatment on their own. 
Socialized medicine will affect even happy events like having a baby. In keeping with the culture of death that surrounds socialized medicine, here's what happened to one mother in Great Britain whose baby was born at 22 weeks — an age at which some infants have survived when life-saving measures were used. Tracy Goodwin watched in horror as they let her baby die. 
Forty-six minutes later [after he was born], and despite her desperate pleas to midwives for assistance, Miss Godwin's son died as she held him. 
She has since been told that the hospital has a policy not to resuscitate babies born earlier than 24 weeks into pregnancy. [via Daily Mail ] Tracy Goodwin (left) holds her baby boy, born at 22 weeks (right). 
If you need to see a doctor, good luck. In Canada, they have to wait 3-4 months just to see their 'primary care physician.' Canadians wait on average 35 weeks, or 6 months, to see a specialist after getting a referral, according to the Fraser Institue . If you have cancer, you could be dead by the time you can see an oncologist. 
This is why most doctors and nurses are fleeing healthcare. We can no longer help our patients the right way, with clear consciences, and those doctors and nurses who support this kind of system are lying to themselves into believing that this system is healthcare. It's managed deathcare, and that is what Big Brother does best. 
What's the answer? Donald Trump . He will repeal Obamacare, and even if he does nothing else, it's a win. He is putting healthcare back into the free market where it belongs. What drives insurance prices down? Competition — and that is what he will do when he opens up buying healthcare across state lines. 
Lastly, a brain surgeon should be paid more than a truck driver, no offense to truck drivers. Yet, under socialized medicine, doctors are made to take a salary which is capped. This, in itself, does not give our smartest kids any incentive to become a brain surgeon. Making a lot of money drives those interested in medicine to become doctors. It's just a fact, and it made our healthcare system the best in the world before Obama came along. 
Back in 1994, Hillary tried to pass socialized medicine called Hillarycare, and it failed. Now, she is back, promising to fix Obamacare with Hillarycare, but if you value your loved ones' lives, there is only one thing to do. Make sure people realize what is at stake in this election. Literally, their lives are on the line if Donald Trump doesn't win.

BOMBSHELL: Leaked Emails Expose How Muslims Got In Obama's Administration Posted on October 27, 2016 by Dawn Parabellum in Politics  
Since the mainstream media won't do their job, people everywhere are making it a point to go through the WikiLeaks emails to uncover the truth that the political elite are trying to hide. Upon perusal of the emails leaked yesterday in dump number 19, an interesting discussion surfaced, exposing how Muslims got in Obama's administration, and it's so unbelievable, you have to read it for yourself. 
Under the subject line, ' Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates, ' we get some juicy insight into how these candidates got into the Obama administration. However, the first thing that should stand out like a sore thumb is the date of this email. October 18, 2008, was about 3 weeks before Obama was elected. Muslims were chosen to be in the Obama administration weeks before his 'election.' 
The date indicates that Gayle Smith and John Podesta were staffing the Obama administration with Muslims weeks before Barack Obama was actually elected. This is not mainstream information, but Mad World News noticed that Obama was 'transitioning' to the White House long before the election even took place. Unfortunately, that is not the worst part of this email. 
The fact that Muslims were selected for the Obama administration before the American public voted for him is not a good sign, but it doesn't look like Obama chose these appointments either. He's not included in the conversation about who will be in his cabinet, leading skeptics to believe that this is all a setup. The date on this is September of 2008, well before Obama was elected. Note the highlighted areas where Christians are specifically excluded. 
The even more terrifying aspect of this email is highlighted. 'I excluded those with some Arab American background who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian.' Those who selected Obama before the election handpicked Muslims for his Administration knowing he'd be 'elected.' Not only that, they specifically excluded Christians. 
This particular email does not list a reason why Christians were excluded and Muslims were chosen specifically because of their religion, but with several more days of WikiLeaks Podesta email dumps, we may get some answers. But, that's still not all. The email also indicated that a list for Muslim DOJ and judges would come soon. 
Later, in the email right before signing off, Preeta Bansal , an Indian-American lawyer who ended up in the Obama administration as the General Counsel and Senior Policy Advisor to the federal Office of Management and Budget from 2009 until 2011, says the Muslim list for the DOJ (Department of Justice) will be on its way soon. Not long after, the list of Muslim Judges and US attorneys to appoint will follow. 
Now, we know how the Obama administration was packed with Muslims, but we still aren't sure why. Maybe they were hoping to avoid discrimination — or perhaps the reason is more sinister. Perhaps the infiltration of the US government with Muslims is a preplanned way to slowly allow the religion to permeate the West. Although that seems far fetched, this email is absolutely horrifying and nothing should shock us anymore after reading these leaked emails.

Hillary Is DONE After Blunt Cowboy Makes Shocking Announcement On Live TV Posted on October 27, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  Fox News Host (left), Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller (right) 
Lies and cover-ups don't sit well with Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller who took advantage of his live interviewÂ to make a shocking announcement. After exposing Hillary Clinton and leaving the reporter speechless, it's safe to say that it's over for the lying Democratic candidate. 
Miller went on Fox News on Wednesday to discuss what he was witness to in his state that Hillary definitely didn't want to get out. With election day just around the corner, when a crucial decision falls into the hands of Americans who will determine the course to the country for the next four years, the proudÂ cowboy didn't hold back. He delivered a stunning statement thatÂ not only put Hillary in her place, it shut her down completely. 
This election has been unlike any other in history and apparently so has the early voter turnout, namely in the Lone Star State. It's not even voting day yet, but patriotic Texans have already turned out in record-breaking droves to be sure to get their ballot in early, with an overwhelming number voting for Donald Trump. The attendance at his rallies seems to have translated to the polls, but Miller also revealed something else in his statement that needs to be known. 
'We have a record number of people registered to vote in Texas. Weâre having record turnouts, the first day, the second day of voting. And itâs not Bernie Sanders supporters coming out to support Hillary. Itâs not Barack Obama supporters coming out to support Hillary,' he first announced before makingÂ the next stunning statement. ' Itâs a new surge of Trump voters, many who have never registered to vote. Many who have not voted in eight or ten elections so theyâre not reported in the polls âŚ' YUGE RECORD BREAKING VOTES in TEXAS!!! & Its Not Bernie Fans or Obama Voters for Hillary Clinton!! ALLL Donald Trump Folksđ #wednesdaywisdom pic.twitter.com/Sn79fMhwXG 
— DEPLORABLE TRUMPCAT (@Darren32895836) October 26, 2016 
Trump has awoken the American spirit in all of us, including those with no previous interest in politics or voting who now feel called to action by his energy and the need for that in our leadership.Â Hillary has tried her hardest to convince the public that the race is over before it's even ended by claiming the win and painting Trump as inept. She's employed tactics of oversampling Democrats to skew the poll results and 'prove' her point, but the reality is revealedÂ in the record we're seeing set already in Texas â which is likely just the start. 
The only emotion Hillary has stirred in the majority of citizens is divisiveness and hate, while her counterpart has done something she is not and will never be capable of. Single-handedly, Trump brought back what Americans have been desperate for over the last eight years of lame duck leadership from Barack Obama. We want someone who proves that he loves his country, is ready to enact real change that everyone can see and not just be lied to about, a man who keeps his promises, loves the God that our country was built on, and will do whatever it takes to honor our rights and defeat our enemies.

Despite being dead for over 7 years, it seems that Michael Jackson's name has just been dragged back into the spotlight once again. Unfortunately for his family, it looks like bad news for the star's estate as a woman leaked the $900,000 sex secret he had kept quiet for a whopping 30 years – and she has proof. 
Most people are aware of Jackson's depraved past involving children – specifically, little boys. However, the most recent person to come forward is actually a woman, who states that the deceased star had molested and sexually assaulted her about 3 decades prior. 
According to LA Times , 'The alleged abuse started in 1986 and occurred in such iconic locations as Neverland Ranch, the set of 'Moonwalker,' Jackson's Encino mansion, and in the back of the singer's limousine, according to papers filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court.' Unfortunately for the family and Jackson's estate, her word isn't all the accuser was armed with . Stock image of Michael Jackson's 'Neverland' ranch 
Among the court filings are scanned copies of checks purportedly paid to her from Jackson or his entertainment companies, which she says were issued to pay her off in exchange for her silence. In all, the checks totaled a whopping $900,000 – a damning number to say the least. 
Furthermore, the largest sum, a check for $600,000, was dated in late 1993, which just so happens to be three months after Jackson found himself in yet another lawsuit, that time with a 13-year-old boy saying he had been molested by the King of Pop. Of course, the payment comes at a time where Jackson would have wanted to ensure that all of his other skeletons remained perfectly quiet in his closet. 
Oddly enough, this is the only time a female victim has come forward to allege a Jackson sexual assault. In addition to that, the woman's lawyer, Vince Finaldi, said the case offers the first evidence that Jackson and his production company — not an insurance carrier — made direct payments to an alleged abuse victim. Michael Jackson (Source: LA Times ) 
The abuse allegedly lasted for over 3 years, beginning when the girl was merely 12 years old and ending just after her 15 th birthday. LA Times adds: 
The woman alleges that for about three years, Jackson fondled her, forced her to orally copulate him, and attempted to have sexual intercourse with her, which caused her to bleed, the lawsuit states. 
Jackson also supplied her with gifts and letters, and two of the notes were attached to the lawsuit. One of the letters ends, 'I'm crazy about you. … All my love, Michael.' 
Of course, the Jackson family lawyer is saying that the entire ordeal is a made-up claim meant to do nothing more than leech off of the star's estate. As the woman – being a sex assault victim – and her identity are being kept quiet for the time being, it's hard to say whether she's looking for a payout or something more. 
Although this man is dead and buried, and under most circumstances should be left to rest in peace, no sex assault victim should ever go without justice. Although money is a good way to buy silence, it certainly does not equate to anything near justice. In fact, it represents the exact opposite as it proves that if you have enough money, you can get away with anything – even sexually abusing a child. This woman deserves her day in court, and it certainly doesn't look like the Jackson family is going to like the end result.

 When 3 female Hillary supporters decided to steal dozens of Trump-Pence signs, they had no idea whose attention they caught. 
Three liberal women were so upset over Donald Trump's rising poll numbers that they decided to go around stealing the Republican candidate's campaign signs off of citizens' lawns. However, just as they were celebrating their bounty on the side of the road, they were instantly smacked with a perfect dose of American justice. 
Liberals are all for free speech unless you disagree with them. In that case, they'll instantly shut down the conversation by labeling you a racist bigot who hates women. If they're feeling especially unpatriotic, they'll let you know that your opinion is hate speech. This is exactly what a group of liberal feminists is claiming after they were recently caught depriving others of their freedom of expression. 
Elizabeth 'Betta' Stothart, Martha Murdick, and Heidi Kendrick were apparently so angry about Trump's 'locker room talk' leaked just in time for the election that they decided to take matters into their own hands. The cowardly trio headed down Route 1 in Falmouth, Maine, plucking Trump-Pence signs from people's yards and tossing them into their vehicle. What the entitled misandrists didn't realize was that a heaping dose of karma was headed their way. 
Fox News reports that the women pulled over on the side of the road on October 14, proudly admiring their unlawful deed, when suddenly a police officer approached the guilty party. Tipped off by their late-night suspicious behavior, the officer confiscated 36 stolen signs and made a report of the crime. 
Humiliated that their own ridiculous conduct was found out, the 3 thought that a warning would be the end of their embarrassment. Adding to their dismay, David Jones, the chairman of the Making Maine Great Again political action committee, heard about the sign thieves and immediately pressed charges of theft against all 3 women. Elizabeth 'Betta' Stothart (pictured) and her accomplices, Martha Murdick and Heidi Kendrick, are scheduled to appear in court. 
'I have a lot of explaining and apologizing to do,' Stothart wrote. 'I also have advice for anyone who might be on the verge of doing something stupid. It's not worth it. Find a healthy way to express your outrage.' 
The Hillary supporters are scheduled to appear in court on December 15, they still can't believe that stealing is breaking the law and, surprisingly to them, they are not above the law like their beloved candidate. 
The women have been charged with theft and it's reported that the chairman isn't letting this go so easily. As cases of campaign sign theft are on the rise, these 3 are likely to be made the example to other potential political thieves. 
In fact, Mad World News reported last week that a Democratic activist was arrested for stealing dozens of Trump-Pence signs in Northfield, Illinois. However, he was only charged with driving with a suspended license and was allowed to keep the stolen property. 
As expected, one of the women made a pathetic attempt to excuse her juvenile behavior. In a Washington Post opinion piece, Stothart whines that she was 'angry' about the women who have accused Trump of sexual harassment and abuse. Of course, she has no outrage over the women and children that Bill Clinton has sexually assaulted, not to mention the victims Hillary threatened and harassed to protect her sexual predator husband. 
Further insulting actual victims of assault, Stothart likens her selective outrage over Trump signs to being 'assaulted,' adding that it is 'rude' for Trump supporters to place signs expressing their political stance on their private property but not equally as offensive for Democrats to show their support for heinous crimes like, say, butchering partially-birthed babies or voting for a woman who laughed about defending a child rapist who she knew was guilty. 
Leftist hacks like Stothart and her gang of mid-life crisis buddies give women a bad name, contributing to the stereotype that the female gender cannot control their emotions. Ending on a comical note, Stothart tells readers 'for God's sake, please, vote.' That's right. A voter for the party that booed God's name 3 times at their national convention is telling everyone to vote — unless, of course, you're voting for Trump. In that case, her tolerance extends as far as your front lawn.

BUSTED: Clinton Foundation Directly Tied To Plot To Steal Election Posted on October 27, 2016 by Prissy Holly in Politics  
Ever since early voting began, numerous reports are claiming that the electronic voting machines are rigged, as votes for Donald Trump are automatically switched to Hillary Clinton. We've all begun to suspect that Hillary is behind the scam, and now, we have further proof that Democrats are the ones tampering with these machines as part of their intricate plan to steal the election. 
We recently reported how Hillary's evil billionaire funder George Soros owns the voting machines in 16 key states, which immediately set off warning bells nationwide. Disturbingly, the massive fraud taking place is not just confined to those 16 areas, as another crooked player in Hillary's election-stealing plot has just been revealed. 
In a bombshell just unearthed by independent researcher Micro Spooky Leaks , A Canadian company by the name of Dominion Voting provides the voting machines to 600 jurisdictions in 22 states and is directly linked to the Clinton Foundation as one of their massive donors. 
On their homepage, the company alludes to how they help rig elections, stating ' we strive to change elections for the better!' which is a chilling statement considering they supply 50% of the electronic voting machines on the U.S. voting market. 
Right after this startling information was revealed, however, it appears as though Democrats immediately began white-washing the information, as the link to the statement on the Wikipedia page that corroborated the bombshell information was mysteriously removed. 
Hillary has played dirty for years, and it appears as though her antics aren't stopping now. After murdering many people close to exposing her scandals as a way to prevent them from ruining her presidential bid, the only thing left now is to steal the election through massive voter fraud. 
The picture at this point is becoming bleak. There's no doubt that Donald Trump can defeat Hillary, as evidenced by his early lead in many historically blue states, and the recent bombshell that Hillary's lead across many polls is completely fake. 
However, fighting back against electronic voting machines that have been calibrated by Hillary operatives to switch votes from Republican to Democrat will be extremely difficult. The only thing we can do at this point is demand a paper ballot when we vote. Dominion Voting machines that will be used in 22 states 
We are coming down to the wire here. Every day, more information surfaces on Hillary and the Democrats' crooked scheme to steal the election. Continue to share stories like this and help fight back and spread the information. 
Knowledge is power, and with the ability to instantly share information with the internet, we can help expose what's going on by constantly barraging our clueless friends and family members with the truth.

WATCH: 'Damn!' Liberal Hosts Flustered Over NEW Proof Clintons Are Dirty   Shae Weatherall in Politics  
On Thursday, the panel on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' reacted to recently leaked documents, proving the Clintons' involvement in dirty financial dealings while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. They were so flustered by the damning evidence, one of the liberal hosts even used the words 'Damn' and 'Yuck' while describing the information as another said this could be the big story that ends it for Hillary. 
Fox News reports that among the new WikiLeaks release of John Podesta's emails was one containing an attachment to a twelve-page memo written in 2011 by Doug Band, a long-time aide to former President Bill Clinton. Within the text, Band talks about the 'circle of enrichment' which financially benefits the Clinton Foundation as well as the Clintons personally. Band used the contacts of his company, Teneo, to solicit donations to the Foundation from major corporations and to set up 'for profit' engagements for Bill Clinton. Band referred to the paid appearances as 'Bill Clinton Inc.' 
Within the memo, Doug Band described his role in helping to make the Clintons rich by leveraging their political influences. ' This memorandum strives to set forth how I have endeavored to support the Clinton Foundation and President Clinton personally ,' Band wrote. 
Under a section titled 'For-Profit Activity of President Clinton (i.e., Bill Clinton, Inc. ),' Band wrote that he and Clinton aide Justin Cooper 'found, developed and brought' to Clinton all four of his advisory arrangements at the time – arrangements that ' yielded more than $30 million for him personally, with $66 million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements .' The memo also included a footnote explaining how Clinton's speaking agent estimated that during a 10-year period, ' $20 million in speeches for the President have derived … from Justin and my efforts.' [via FOX News ] 
This leaked memo consumed a large portion of Thursday's 'Morning Joe' on MSNBC , however, it's clear in the first two minutes of the five-minute clip below that the show's panel is shocked and flustered over the Clintons' dirty financial dealings that have been exposed. Mika Brzezinski even suggested that the only word that can be added to the discussion of the new scandal is ' Damn! ' 
Joe Scarborough commented with some derision about how he views the Clintons' use of their political leverage and their 'charitable' Foundation as bait to fatten their own personal bank accounts. ' Maybe they're using the State Department, but using relief work in Haiti? 'Hey can you help those suffering in Haiti? It's really important. Thanks, listen, could you also give Bill Clinton $500,000 to give a speech? In your corporate luxury box?' ' At the end of Joe's impression of the unethical dealings, Mika added a disgusted, ' Yuck .' 
Yuck, indeed. Also during the panel discussion, it was asked what the perception would be if a Bush had been engaged in this type of scandal. Incredibly, several of the participants, including Joe, admitted that the Bush family 'would never do this.' 
Finally, the magnitude of the collective proof of the Clintons' unethical and illegal activities appear to have put seeds of doubt in the minds of some of their loyalists, but is it enough? Is it too late? Even though a few of the liberal news outlets have chosen to do the right thing, for once, in reporting on this 'Bill Clinton Inc.' scandal, it's unlikely it will last long in the spotlight of the national media. 
It's up to us, We the People , to make sure this kind of information reaches every corner of social media in the hopes that it will help to influence those voters who are still undecided. We only have ten days left to share the truth and make sure Hillary Clinton stays far away from our White House.

Kid Has 'Birthday Surprise' For Church, Does The Unexpected While Inside   Alisha Rich in Religion  
A teenager recently celebrated his birthday in Harriman, Tennessee. However, the kid isn't so fond of his yearly celebration and finally became fed up with it, devising a plan not many would consider. In fact, he came up with a 'birthday surprise' for a local church, and onlookers spotted him doing the unexpected after he walked inside. Ryan Nelson 
Ryan Nelson, 13, had explained to his parents that he didn't want to celebrate his birthday. Although most kids would like to invite all of their friends, open gifts, and eat some birthday cake, Ryan didn't want to spend his special day that way. Instead of having a huge ordeal for himself, he devised a plan that not many people would ever consider. He was going to give a 'birthday surprise' to a church. 
Ryan decided to take the money his parents would have spent on a party, as well as all of his birthday money, and he donated it to a local church. 'He also packed up and donated canned soups, ramen noodles and lots of clothes and blankets,' according to WVLT . His donations will go to the M-14 Ministries' 'Dry Bones' shelter. 
'The community, in my opinion, has given me so much,' Ryan explained. 'So I think this year, on my birthday, it's time to give back to the community.' Ryan's donations 
The director of the shelter, Dwayne Linger, was overwhelmed by Ryan's generosity. 'I just hope that other kids see what he's done and follow his lead,' Linger said. 'I think it's a great blessing, what he's done.' Ryan admitted that he came up with the idea after he watched his mother donate to another church earlier this year. 
It's great to see that some of those in the younger generation can think about someone other than themselves. We need to ensure that our children realize how much of an impact their beliefs and actions will have on our country's future.

Although the vandal who thought it was 'cool' to destroy Donald Trump's Hollywood star looked pretty comfortable making a video from the comfort of his own home, that can't be said for him today. In fact, it seems that the idiot just got exactly what he deserved – and that's not even the real kicker. 
Yesterday, Mad World News reported on James Otis, the man who was recorded destroying Trump's star on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, California and stealing the two plaques that were in the concrete. Of course, he later stated that the two stolen objects would be auctioned off on election day with the proceeds promised to Trump's so-called 'victims.' 
Proving to be a cocky moron, Otis gave an itinerary, saying that he wanted to deliver a few remarks at the location of his crime at 9:30 this morning. Unfortunately for him, things didn't go according to plan as the man just got exactly what he deserved. Donald Trump's Hollywood star before (left) and after (right) James Otis destroyed it 
Although Otis had promised to turn himself in today, Deadline reports that police tracked him down and arrested him before he could use the incident to further himself any more. Unfortunately for him, the news got even worse when he was officially slapped with a felony vandalism charge. Oh, and that little 'auction' he was going to have isn't going to happen since police confiscated at least one of the plaques, which they found stashed in Otis's car: Police confiscated at least one part of the plaque (Source: TMZ ) 
The real kicker came next, though. Since damages were valued at over $400 , Otis is facing up to 3 years in jail and more than $10,000 in fines. Of course, Otis didn't seem to mind facing the consequences – until, that is, he heard what he'd actually earned. James Otis 
In fact, he only made himself out to be more of an idiot during an interview with the Los Angeles Daily News when he said, 'I was just so fed up, so saddened and fed up by Mr. Trump and how he continues to denigrate women, and he continues to joke and make fun about sexual violence and his own exploits against women.' 
Clearly uninformed on the truth, he then added , 'It's just a big joke to him. I have children; I have many women in my life who don't think it's a joke. But he does.' He continued, 'He lies about it, he shuffles and I don't see, there's no reason to believe at all that it will ever stop now. He'll continue to do this, he'll continue to make women suffer. So that's what I'd tell him. 'You need help. Please understand that.' Trump's star is already being repaired (Source: Breitbart ) 
Otis doesn't even understand that what he did wasn't really any big deal. As of right now, the star is being replaced. Furthermore, destroying that property didn't do a darn thing to Trump since it wasn't his property – it was the states. In short, he just cost the American taxpayer more money because now we have to fix it. 
That's the problem with the entitled mentality these days – it doesn't matter to them who they hurt in the process. Of course, coming off looking like an idiot sure can't feel good, but he'll get a nice long time to think about that while he's rotting in prison for a few years.

Set Staff Horrified At What Hillary Is Caught Doing After Brutal Interview Posted on October 27, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  Set of the Commander-in-Chief Forum (left), Hillary Clinton at the Forum (right) 
It was only a matter of time before the glue that keeps Hillary Clinton together cracked and her true evil self came out from behind her forced smile. Looking visibly uncomfortable in front of the camera during a particularly brutal interview, Hillary exited stage left as quick as she could when a horrified staff member caught what she did backstage. 
Hillary probably felt safe going into the interview by liberal-leaning Matt Lauer, who conducted a televised question and answer session with the Democratic candidate in September at the Commander-in-Chief Forum. As she's apparently accustomed to, Hillary allegedly received a list of questions before the event, so she could prepare her answers (lies) and prevent being caught on the spot to come up with what to say, making her come across flawlessly to the public. Thinking everything was worked to her advantage as is typically the case, Lauer threw the candidate a curve ball that Hillary couldn't hide from. 
According to The Watch Towers, a Comcast official (the parent company of NBC Universal) stated that Lauer went rogue when he asked 'one legitimate question about the FBI investigation concerning her homemade server and the unsecured emails.' The alleged informant said at that point 'we could see she (Hillary) was beginning to boil.' 
It's evident by her expression and tone caught in the recording of the Forum interview that Hillary wasn't happy about being forced to answer a question she wasn't prepared for. Holding her rage inside the best she could, the person claiming to be a producer on the set, accused Hillary of launching an explosive verbal assault on her staff backstage after the interview. 
'She was in a full meltdown and no one on her staff dared speak with her – she went kind of manic and didn't have any control over herself at that point,' the anonymous informant claimed in an unconfirmed report by Watch Towers . 
'Hillary proceeded to pick up a full glass of water and throw it at the face of her assistant, and the screaming started,' the description of the alleged events also said. The staffer claimed that they heard Hillary turn her rage on Donald Trump, saying, 'If that f – – – ing bastard wins, we all hang from nooses! Lauer's finished…and if I lose it's all on your heads for screwing this up.' 
While the reports of this incident have not been authenticated, it definitely doesn't seem out of character for Hillary, and with what happened to Lauer after the interview certainly shows that the Democratic candidate complained. 'Matt Lauer was massively criticized for the rest of the week on air by the Clinton campaign and the rest of the MSM as having conducted 'an unfair and partisan attack on Clinton',' Watch Towers reported. 
As we saw in the court hearings over Benghazi, Hillary is a loose cannon when being called out on her illegal, dishonest, and deadly actions that she's not used to being confronted on. Whether this explosive tirade happened or not — to any degree of severity — her angry actions against the American people and our heroes she disrespects, speak volumes about who she is, which isn't someone we need leading our country.

Donald Trump's Diversity Chairwoman Brunell Donald-Kyei has been laying waste to anyone who takes her on, and she just shredded one of Michelle Obama's favorite spokesmen, Brian Benjamin, who now works on Hillary Clinton's campaign. When it came to the race card, Brunell was lethal, cutting down his every liberal lie. She tore him apart, then kicked him to the curb, as another Michelle and Hillary spokesman bit the dust. Michelle Obama's favorite pundit Brian Benjamin (left), Hillary & her hot sauce (middle), Brunell Donald-Kyei (right) 
Brian Benjamin kept an arrogant smile on his face as Donald Trump's Diversity Chairwoman Brunell Donald-Kyei surgically sliced through Hillary's pandering to the black community. They appeared on Fox and Friends a few days ago and the video is only getting more popular as interest in Brunell's tactics is making headlines. 
Unsurprisingly, Fox & Friends Monday has been focusing on the latest to emerge out of the WikiLeaks scandal, and one detail concerning the use of the phrase ' yo mama ,' suggested a pandering effort to an African American crowd by Clinton earlier this year. Joining Fox & Friends to discuss was vice-chair of the Trump National Diversity Coalition Brunell Donald-Kyei who said, 'The pandering is not working. Black people just want a real seat at the table.' [via Mediaite ] 
As Brunell laid Benjamin out cold, he had to pull out the race card, but that was a wrong move. Brunell was waiting for it, and she launched into a tirade that made Hillary and her 'hot sauce' in my purse comment look as stupid as it sounded, as poor Steve Doocy tried to moderate. 
Brunell went off, saying the communities need jobs, not hot sauce and 'yo mama' jokes. She added that the black community wants empowerment and the Democratic party to keep its promises. Benjamin was quick to interrupt, alleging Trump talks about law and order but ignores systemic issues between the community and the police. However, Brunell wasn't about to let him get away with his lie. 
She quickly pointed out that mass incarceration happened under Bill and Hillary Clinton, telling Benjamin that he knows that too. 'His wife [Hillary] was ok with that. So don't go there,' she said. 'Let Donald Trump fix it. Let a person who is a builder and a doer fix it.' 
Benjamin tried to retort, calling Trump a racist, and that's all it took to really cause Brunell to unleash. ' Not a loser, not a taco bowl, or needy Latino? Really? Are we going there? Catholics are bastardized. Are we going there? ' she asked, referring to the WikiLeaks emails that exposed the Hillary camp's true thoughts and nasty remarks about many Americans. 
Benjamin shot back, 'Yea, let's go there,' before Brunell finished him off, saying, 'I went there, WikiLeaks is out in the streets, Sir. I read WikiLeaks. I read about the corruption.' 
This exchange proves that when these Hillary shills get beat, they turn to the race card every time. When Brunell hears that, as a black woman, she can go full throttle at Benjamin, and his nervous laughter and scoffing means he is embarrassed and lost this argument, which shreds Hillary's whole narrative about why Americans shouldn't vote for Trump. 
Hillary is a one note wonder. She has no positive record to run on, and her whole campaign is based on bullying Trump supporters. In her narrative, Trump is a Nazi and so are those of us who support him. So, we are fair game to be bullied — on the internet or in person as we have seen the paid thugs do. 
It's all smoke and mirrors because it just doesn't hold true, and Brunell brought that out as she left Benjamin, one of Hillary's token black spokesmen, to languish as he failed to make anyone believe the lie Hillary is trying to sell to Americans. This is all Hillary's got to run on, and it will not be enough to win.

Badass Patriot Has MASSIVE Surprise For Thieves Who Stole His Trump Sign   Amanda Shea   Trump supporters 
It's become a trend for Hillary Clinton-supporters with far too much time on their hands to steal any Donald Trump sign they can get their grubby hands on. There's no returning the 'favor' by taking a Hillary sign since they are practically non-existent in almost all neighborhoods. So, one proud patriot took retaliation to new heights ensuring liberals stay away from his sign. 
The unnamed owner of the Trump sign, who is believed to be in Arizona, is aware that his sign may not cost a lot but is worth much more than the plastic it's printed on based on what it represents — a chance to take America back. Hillary-supporters are an odd group of people who seem to believe that the Constitutional right to free speech is only bestowed upon them, along with the power to take it from anyone who says something that they don't like. 
Perhaps this the driving purpose behind the nationwide rash of Trump sign theft, paired with the fact that they think that they're 'helping' by removing these visual statements of support from public view. Either way, where there is a Trump sign, there's a liberal nearby waiting for their chance to make a stupid statement of their own in stealing it. 
However, this sign owner beat them to the punch by putting it in a place that was not only impossible to reach but showed his support of the GOP candidate loud and proud. It sat up high in a tall tree, keeping it out of reach for thieving liberals. Taking Trump sign to new heights to prevent it from being stolen and make a bold message at the same time. 
If liberals really want to show their support for Hillary, they'll have to climb this massive tree and tear it down, but chances are, they're not as tough as they think they are and prefer to stick to easy to steal signs. We commend the hero for Trump who showed his bravery in putting the sign up so high, knowing that no liberal would dare to go there since it's so far out of their safe space and more work than they are willing to perform.

As Hillary Stumbles Up Plane Steps, Cameras Catch What She Tried To Hide   Robert Rich   
Hillary Clinton has been a busy woman, trying to keep up her appearances and make Americans believe she is in prime condition and fit for the presidency. However, she recently stumbled as she going up some steps. Too bad for her, cameras were there to catch what she tried to hide the entire way up. 
Hillary was set to fly to a rally in Winston-Salem, North Carolina on her private jet, but not before making a fool of herself on the steps. Those on the right have been saying for months now that there's something not right regarding Hillary's health – and a recent video may just prove that. 
Although the clip starts out simple enough, Hillary only makes it about halfway up the stairs before she stumbles a bit. From there on out, the female presidential hopeful tried to hide her seemingly unsteady trek up the rest of the stairs. 
Viewers watch as Hillary slows her pace and grips even tighter on that railing on her way up. She can also be seen looking down to ensure that every step lands with a firm foot as she makes her climb – something that people without a fear of frequent falls wouldn't do. 
Perhaps what's even stranger is the fact that just after she started stumbling, it appears as though Hillary is muttering something to herself for much of the short journey to the plane. Although it's just speculation, it looks as though Hillary was flustered by the trip. However, people seem most concerned with her labored ascent up those steps. 
In fact, The Daily Mirror adds: 
From the time she departed her motorcade van, which was positioned right at the bottom of the stairs, all the way to the top of the steps, she appeared to be wobbly and unsteady, and laboring during the trek. 
Maybe it was because she had the extra — arduous — task of carrying an umbrella? 
It doesn't take much to see just how weak and frail Hillary Clinton is, and videos like this only make it that much clearer. This woman doesn't so much resemble a presidential candidate as she does someone's ailing grandma. It's time for Hillary to face the music and throw in the towel. If she can't physically handle a one-year campaign, she's certainly not suited for what a 4-year presidential term is going to throw at her.

Trump Supporters Get Last Laugh After Hillary Disrespects Them On Radio Show Posted on October 27, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics  
Hillary Clinton is once again pandering to the black community as she's often done, changing who she is depending on who she is talking to. However, just yesterday, she made a wrong move, hitting Donald Trump's supporters as she told a hip-hop radio show that Trump and his supporters need to do one thing. Unfortunately for her, she quickly learned that she can't talk trash and get away with it anymore. 
Hillary showed up on some hip-hop radio station in New York yesterday, and the interview was pure propaganda as she tried to pander to the black community. Hillary even agreed that she gets her fashion look from Death Row Records' Suge Knight and Snoop Dogg. 
Wherever she gets it, that look is hideous and horrible. Not to mention, Death Row Records was made famous by a song titled 'F*ck The Police.' That seems rather fitting since Hillary doesn't care about cops. She just needs black voters to show up on election day. Hillary agreed with a black radio host that she gets her look from Death Row records, a known cop-hating label that produced the song 'F*ck The Police.' 
After talking about her failed fashion sense, she had to get her jab in on Donald Trump, but she took it further than she should have. The Breakfast Club radio host told Hillary that the whole country is divided and that she has to bring it back together. This sparked Hillary to launch her attack, saying: 
' What Trump has done is to make it possible for people who have racist and sexist and all kinds of prejudices and bigotry to put them right out there ,' Hillary said. 'But what he's done really [is] unleashed a lot of darkness and divisiveness.' 
We all know the only game Hillary's got going is this thinly veiled narrative that Trump supporters are racist, sexist, and violent. We are 'deplorables,' a remark she purposefully made to describe Trump supporters because it is her campaign plan. 
Unfortunately for her, Trump supporters aren't stupid, and those who are very active on social media fought back at her false rhetoric. For hours after her comments on that radio show, the hashtag # HillarysBullies was trending worldwide. 
Trump supporters made a mockery out of Hillary , sending a truth bomb straight at her. It's Hillary who is purposely dividing the country with her rhetoric. It's Hillary who hired paid thugs to beat up Trump supporters. Even Mike Pence got into the act, and below is his tweet to Hillary: "I'm Hillary Clinton & I approve this message." #HillarysBullies were bought & paid for. pic.twitter.com/onahYVpGlw

Hillary is losing this election. Every indication outside the mainstream press shows that there's little to no enthusiasm for her campaign. Record-breaking numbers of Trump supporters have been seen across the country where early voting is allowed, and even today, Hillary needed Michelle Obama to beg North Carolinians to bring out people to vote. 
With only days left, Trump supporters slapped Hillary hard on social media, and all she's got is a weak campaign slogan and the lie that Trump's a racist and so are his deplorable supporters. From her small rally sizes, it's clear, Americans smell her bullcrap and no one really wants to hear that screeching voice or see her win.

The upcoming election has our nation on pins and needles, but none more so than the idiots on the left. Proving just that was a few morons who decided to run over a Donald Trump lawn sign that they saw on the side of the road – and that's when they got slapped with the perfect dose of justice. 
The incident was posted to the Twitter account of a black Trump supporter named Tallah who lives in Detroit, Michigan. Now, if ever there was a place that should be sick of Democrats, it should be Detroit, but apparently, there are still people living in the city who enjoy living life as a slave to the government. Tallah (right) (Photo Source: Twitter ) 
Proving just that, it seems that a few of Tallah's Trump lawn signs triggered a liberal who just had to do something about it. Captured by pictures after the fact, the idiot decided the best way to voice his negative opinion on Trump was to destroy the woman's property. 
As can be seen, the idiot decided to swerve off the road and run over 4 signs that were sitting in Tallah's front lawn. Unfortunately for him, he was about to get a nasty dose of instance justice – and it's just delectable. Triggered lefty ran over Tallah's Trump signs but got a nasty surprise (Photo Source: Twitter ) 
As it turns out, this clearly wasn't the first run in that Tallah had with triggered liberals. She put out a little surprise for anyone who would try what this triggered lefty did. Also captured in the photos was the woman's homemade booby trap – a board with nails sticking up just below the signs. Booby trap (Photo Source: Twitter ) 
At the end of the day, the trap did exactly what it was supposed to – popped the tires of an entitled piece of garbage that thought they could do whatever they wanted. Too bad for them, Tallah even managed to get a picture of the idiot responsible as he tried to put the spare tire on his car. Triggered liberals licking their wounds (Photo Source: Twitter ) 
However, it seems that the popped tire wasn't even the best part of the picture. After zooming in on the morons' faces, their expression shows that they received every bit of justice that they deserved. Even better yet, the signs weren't even really destroyed. It looks like all Tallah would need to do is bend them back up to standing position. Close up on the entitled punks' faces (Photo Source: Twitter ) 
It just goes to show, the entitled mentality is getting out of hand in this country. However, if liberals want to play dirty at every corner, we can whip out a few tricks of our own. With that being said, let's just hope this triggered fool learned a lesson. After all, I'm sure his decision to destroy a $20 sign wasn't worth the price to get a new tire.

As Donald Trump continues his campaign, it seems that a few keen eyes picked up on something rather peculiar. Taking place as Trump arrived in Ohio, something downright 'insane' was spotted in the crowd – and many are saying it proves that Hillary Clinton is done for good. 
The incident actually took place back in September but is most recently proving true on a daily basis now. According to reports, Trump showed up in Columbus, Ohio earlier in his campaign, and when he opened his limo door, something incredible was waiting for him .

As Liberty Writers News puts it, 'the crowd went insane for America's 45 th president.' It goes without saying that there is a huge enthusiasm difference between the two candidates for president and their supporters. Although this was proven true back in September, it's being demonstrated even more so today.

In fact, BizPac Review reports that Hillary's running mate, Tim Kaine, can't even muster up a crowd with triple digits – heck, even 50 people is hard to come by. Furthermore, Kaine is having to cancel events as only 30 people are showing up.

Of course, his staff is blaming it on 'scheduling issues,' but it's happened more than once at this point, proving a pattern here. Mike Pence, on the other hand, is having the exact opposite problem as the venues he's speaking at don't have room for the thousands of people who are showing up. 
— Linda Suhler, Ph.D. (@LindaSuhler) October 27, 2016 
Between the FBI reopening her email investigation and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange promising that his next leak will land her in prison , things aren't looking good for Hillary. Put that in combination with the fact that Trump and Pence are bringing people in by the thousands, where Hillary and her running mate can't seem to manage bringing in supporters by mere the hundreds – well, it's safe to say that this goose is just about cooked. 
Hillary Clinton is done, and this nation is going to make that perfectly clear come Election Day. We the People are done with the politically corrupt government elites that have poisoned our country. I can't wait to see the look on Hillary's face when she realizes that she's going to prison for a very long time, just like Trump promised.

Hillary Immediately Runs From Media After What Camera Caught Outside Plane Posted on October 28, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  Aboard Hillary Clinton's plane (left), 'Hill Force One' (right) 
While Hillary Clinton was en route to Cedar Rapids, Iowa for what ended up being a very uncomfortable campaign stop, she got some bad news. The FBI is taking another look at her emails — which could likely end her. Media rushed to the runway after her arrival, where cameras caught what she tried to hide outside her private airplane. 
The FBI announced that they are looking into Hillary's previously undisclosed emails as she was mid-air and blissfully unaware and unable to prepare. Knowing what's in those documents, she's more aware of the ramifications than the rest of us, but because it was sprung on her, she wasn't fully prepared for questions about it since she requires practiced answers that she receives ahead of time before talking to the public. 
However, forced to face the music upon landing, Hillary couldn't escape the press pool waiting for her as she made a beeline for her getaway car from the airplane. That's when she did something very telling of her guilt. JUST IN: Hillary Clinton arrives in Iowa amid news the FBI is taking another look at her email server https://t.co/uH00LebKTe pic.twitter.com/rxFkJZXEvo 
— CNN (@CNN) October 28, 2016 
Knowing that there was no way around the reporters, Hillary hid in Hill Force One with her advisors for about 30 minutes, who we can only imagine were calming the raging candidate down before she faced the public. Our guess is, she had a moment of meltdown with the news, screamed, yelled, and then was given a shot of her favorite liquor before exiting the aircraft, where she was met with a barrage of questions about the investigation. Rather than responding, which an innocent person would do, she flashed a fake smile and wave and didn't say a single word. 
It would take too much explanation to lie, and she'd only further incriminate herself, so she gave the press the silent treatment instead, which actually spoke volumes. No matter how much Hillary ignores this, it's not going away, as the truth will prevail against her and, hopefully, land her in the jailhouse — not the White House.

SHOCKING: Hillary's Looking At Disaster & Anthony Weiner's To Blame Posted on October 28, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics  
Hillary Clinton just got hit with a huge roadblock by the FBI in her quest for the presidency, and things are looking pretty dire for her campaign and election hopes. However, the Clintons play dirty, and she won't go down easily. Yet, in a crazy turn of events, it looks like the fall of Hillary Clinton is linked to none other than Anthony Weiner, and what's been exposed now going to shock the whole world. Hillary Clinton (left), Anthony Weiner (right) 
Hillary's campaign was rocked today by FBI James Comey as he announced the reopening of the investigation into Hillary's email server and sending of classified emails. When Hillary spoke in Iowa after the huge announcement, she was delusional as she gave her prepared comments and said nothing about the FBI's case against her. 
Adding fuel to the fire, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook did something pretty damning, just minutes after the Comey announcement. He deleted his entire Twitter feed and years of tweets that must have incriminated him in some way to Hillary's email scandal. But, that's not all. 
Fox News is reporting that the FBI found other emails from another government official, not from WikiLeaks but coming from an investigation into Anthony Weiner , which may indicate that his wife Huma Abedin, Hillary's closest aide, is the link to the disaster Hillary is now facing: 
'A senior law enforcement official separately told Fox News the FBI decision is not linked to WikiLeaks messages or any hack, and the newly discovered emails did not come from the Clinton server – but from another device from another government official.' 
Hillary doesn't live in the real world very well, so she won't go quietly, even though it's pretty clear her campaign is probably over. Even when facing defeat against Barack Obama in 2008, she would not give up. 
Even when it came to the battle for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton refused to concede defeat until the bitter end and then past it. Not only did Hillary refuse to drop out even when Obama was the clear winner, while her people threatened a convention floor fight, but she insisted on staying on in the race for increasingly bizarre and even downright disturbing reasons. 
In South Dakota, Hillary explained that there was no reason for her to drop out because somebody might shoot Barack Obama, 'We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.' [via Sultan Knish ] 
Even after Obama had clinched the delegate votes, Hillary's speech brought back the Al Gore argument that George Bush didn't win the election in 2000, saying, 'Nearly 18 million of you cast your votes for our campaign, carrying the popular vote with more votes than any primary candidate in history. Even when the pundits and the naysayers proclaimed week after week that this race was over, you kept on voting.' Robby Mook (left) deleted his entire Twitter feed after FBI re-opened email case, Huma Abedin & Hillary Clinton (right) 
Look for Hillary, refusing to drop out of this campaign, and We the People need to put pressure on the FBI to conclude this investigation before Election Day. We cannot have a sitting president who will be going to prison, and yet, we know that Hillary Clinton will refuse to drop out no matter how dire this situation truly is. 
The mere fact that we all know she is guilty of sending classified documents makes her unfit to hold any political office ever again, and Americans must demand Hillary Clinton is held accountable. It's time we take back our country and put Hillary in prison where she belongs.

When a man heard a knock on his door in Chicago, Illinois, he discovered a meter reader had arrived. However, the homeowner would instantly regret his decision to let the man inside his home once he revealed his sinister plan that will undoubtedly leave your stomach churning. 
Willie Bell was devastated when his girlfriend chose another man over him. Fueled by rage, Bell devised a sinister plan to pose as a meter reader and enter his romantic rival's home and do the one thing he thought would return his girl to him – he killed the 'other man.' 
The homeowner, Timothy Lawrence, had unknowingly stolen Bell's girlfriend, but he'd soon find out while he was merely minding his own business and a knock was heard on his door. When he saw a meter reader who claimed he had come to collect some data, Lawrence welcomed him into his home. However, as soon as the door shut, Bell revealed his true identity, and in a jealous fit of rage, he shot Lawrence in the head. Willie Bell at Timothy Lawrence's home, Bell's mugshot (inset) 
Surveillance video shows Bell dressed in a reflective workman's vest and helmet, 'working' around Lawrence's home. Since the two men had never met, Lawrence had no idea who Bell really was until he welcomed him into his home. An hour after he entered Lawrence's house, Bell was seen on the same surveillance video leaving the home wearing 'a T-shirt that read 'I'm that dude,'' according to Pix 11. 
After Bell stole the victim's 2004 Buick LeSabre, he went to a local gas station to purchase gasoline and picked up an unidentified accomplice to come back to the home with him some time later. Once they arrived, they entered the home, poured the gasoline, and lit it on fire. Before firefighters could arrive, the house exploded. Lawrence's body was later recovered from the charred wreckage. 
Luckily, the surveillance footage, which miraculously wasn't destroyed in the fire, was also recovered, and police were able to identify and apprehend Bell. He was denied bail during a hearing at Cook County court, and he's facing charges of first-degree murder and concealment of a homicide. 'The actions of the defendant were cold, calculating, and pre-planned,' Judge James Brown said during the hearing, according to the Chicago Tribune . 'The only reasonable order would be an order of no bail.' 
Whenever anyone is at your door, it's important to confirm who they are before letting them inside, regardless of who they claim to be. When all is said and done, it's better to be safe than sorry, and your life could very well depend on it.

 Hillary Clinton is undoubtedly having a terrible day after finding out the FBI investigation has been reopened. However, she's was instantly steamrolled with more devastating news concerning her recent poll lead. 
Hillary Clinton and her leftist lapdog media have been busy celebrating her 'imminent' victory, practically declaring her president before the election is even over. However, in an unbelievable turn of events, she just received some potentially devastating news about her poll lead over Donald Trump that has the nation in an uproar. 
Just recently, Hillary and her team of liberal shills were busted 'rigging elections' with both massive voter fraud at the polls and working with mainstream media outlets to perpetuate a bias against Trump to cover her own felonious scandals. The partiality and voter fraud are so severe that many were left wondering if there's really any way to beat Hillary or if it's a predetermined selection from the liberal elitists. 
Just as Hillary thought she was going to hobble straight into the White House again, however, she received some news that crucially threatens her election during the most critical time. 
Breitbart reports that less than one week after Trump was suffering an immense lag behind Hillary in the polls, the gap is suddenly coming to a close with the Republican nominee leaping forward a massive 5 points, leaving him just 4 behind the Democratic opponent. Even though Trump was at 38 percent on October 22, he has since rapidly climbed to 44 percent and is expected to seal the gap. 
The unbelievable rise in Trump's support comes just before the FBI announced that it is reopening their investigation into Hillary's private email server, meaning that his approval rating is sure to skyrocket even further with the great chance that he'll surpass the scandalous liberal candidate just as voters head to the polls. Even before the FBI announced it will re-investigate Hillary Clinton's private email server, Trump was already closing the polling gap. It's likely that he will easily catch up to her since more classified emails have been leaked. 
What's even more miraculous is that Trump is fighting against all odds, including a stifling media bias that's found to wholly working against him with 91 percent of 184 opinionated statements considered to be negative. However, even this buying of the mainstream media hasn't stopped the hypothetical Trump train, as the underdog candidate even won early votes in Florida and is the only Republican to do so in the critical swing state. 
Although Hillary and her media pets have been tirelessly scheming around the clock to discourage citizens from voting for Trump, reporting fake poll numbers that show her in a major lead, even the left-leaning ABC and Washington Post couldn't deny Trump's rapid incline. Not only has Trump gained 5 points, according to their tracking poll, Hillary fell 2, meaning that either undecided or Hillary voters are beginning to support Trump. 
Ironically, even Hillary's campaign manager Robby Mook was forced to admit that Trump could very well be the next U.S. President. 
'Donald Trump has been going around telling people not to listen to the polls, and saying that he can still win this race. Well, you know what, he's absolutely right,' Mook announced in a video. 
Just minutes after FBI Director James Comey officially announced the reopened investigation, the stocks suddenly started to tank , which many believe is indicative of a Trump win. It appears as though the liberal elite and Wall Street bankers are panicking at the idea that the easily bought Hillary might not make it to November 8. 
Regardless of your stance on the presidential election, it's clear that the mainstream media has been purchased and is striving to scare Trump voters away from the polls. Considering that this is true, imagine just how many more potential Trump voters are staying home because they feel as though a victory is hopeless — when, indeed, it's obviously not.

Clinton Advisor LOSES IT In Leaked Email Over Hillary's Illegal Activity Posted on October 28, 2016 by Dawn Parabellum in Politics  
Nothing is more satisfying than Democrats turning on each other, and that's exactly what has happened in the Hillary Clinton camp. As if we haven't heard enough of Hillary's incompetence and corruption, a newly leaked email shows a top Clinton advisor absolutely losing it over Hillary's illegal activity, and her shocking admissions don't paint a pretty picture for the Democrat Party. 
Thieves and liars are commonplace, but when a person is running for President of the United States, perhaps they should conduct themselves in a manner that commands respect. Hillary Clinton has never been trustworthy in the eyes of rational Americans, and even her advisors picked up on the trouble she's gotten herself in. The leaked emails are telling and have shown the Clinton campaign as struggling with damn near every aspect of her run for president because Americans are fed up with her lies and corruption. Hillary Clinton 
In newly-released emails from WikiLeaks, Neera Tanden, co-chair of Clinton's transition team, cusses at John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman. Tanden is upset about Hillary using the private email and server system, wondering who could have approved of such a thing, which literally left Hillary's team hoping that the Democratic Party isn't 'suicidal.' Obviously, Tanden is angry because the scandal is damning to Hillary's political career, and they are all linked to the corrupt Democrat. Email from Tanden to Podesta complaining about Hillary's email debacle 
Tanden actually said that whoever gave the OK should be 'drawn and quartered,' calling the whole situation 'f***ing insane' in the July 2015 message. Podesta even agreed with her assessment and that the refusal to mention it earlier was 'unbelievable.' Hillary Clinton advisor, Neera Tanden 
'[I] guess I know the answer,' Tanden replied. '[T]hey wanted to get away with it.' 
Hillary Clinton has still declined to answer to any of the revelations leaked in the Podesta emails. It's likely that there is absolutely no good way for her to handle any of this. She could claim her advisors are liars, but then we would question her judgment in selecting them. She could admit that everything is true, but that's just coming out stating emphatically that she's a corrupt criminal. Or, she could just ignore it and hope her lapdog media will make it go away, which seems to be exactly what she's doing. 
The leaked Podesta emails are not done, and with the election coming upon us quickly, it's hard to image what else will be released. Those of us who actually do care about the abuses of government, unlike the mainstream media, will keep a diligent eye and report what's found because we all know that the media is trying to sweep this under the rug permanently. Too bad for them, it's not going to work, and thanks to the internet and social media, not only can we inform ourselves, we can spread the information to others without relying on the equally corrupt press who are covering for that crooked Clinton.

After being entrusted with a room full of votes, two Florida women were on the job when a co-worker showed up and caught what they were hiding at the ballot center. Terrified by what they had just walked in on, the employee immediately reported it to the police, and now, these two are where they belong — in jail. 
Evidently, Democrats will trust anyone with a pulse to do a job that requires a lot of honesty and integrity, then turn around and tell voting citizens not to worry about voter fraud because it 'isn't real.' This line, discrediting conservatives' concern, has been repeated extensively by pro-Hillary Clinton liberal media over the last couple of weeks, assuming that Americans are stupid enough to ignore what they see and take their word for it. 
However, the more they say it, the more proof comes out. What happened in the battleground state of Florida should terrify everyone relying on an honest system for Donald Trump to win. 
We saw a situation in 2012 that reeked of undeniable voter fraud when Mitt Romney was ahead in the polls by a landslide but lost, which was likely due in part to entire counties strangely missing every single vote for the Republican. We're supposed to just accept that nothing of the sort will happen this year, even though it seems to occur every election. Two Miami women just proved liberals wrong with what they were caught doing during a Mayoral race and ballot initiative, which you can only assume takes place for presidential elections when the stakes are much higher. 
According to the Miami Herald , 74-year-old Gladys Coego was simply supposed to open completed ballots sent in from county voters and set them aside. However, she took this trust as an opportunity to give her mayoral candidate of choice, Raquel Regalado, an unknown number of votes. She apparently wanted Regalado to win bad enough that she was willing to commit a felony to make it happen. 
Democrats would excuse this fraudulent voting behavior as a very rare instance that's not of concern for any other race, however, 33-year-old Tomika Curgil disproved that lie with the voter fraud she also committed in Florida. Curgil is accused of taking liberties to complete ballots for her own agenda, without people's consent, and also 'submitted at least 17 forms for people who apparently don't exist — and several forms for people who are dead,' the Miami Herald explained. 
If voter fraud isn't real, then these two dishonest ballot-workers wouldn't have been arrested for it. What they were willing to do in a small election setting, with rather innocuous results, only proves that the same desperate level of dishonesty is bound to occur when it come to ensuring their equally dishonest leader takes office.

As Hillary's Henchmen Try To Silence WikiLeaks, Assange Gets Sweet Revenge Posted on October 28, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics  
For many Americans, there's little doubt that Democrats were behind shutting down Julian Assange in a desperate attempt to silence what he knows, but it's not working. In fact, just a short while after Hillary Clinton's henchmen cut him off from the rest of the world, it seems that Assange is about to get himself some sweet revenge – and hopefully, the presidential hopeful likes the color orange. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange (left) and Hillary Clinton (right) 
Democrats are using every dirty trick in the book, despite their recent motto being 'when they go low, we'll go high.' In fact, it certainly seems that the only people going low are Hillary Clinton and those fiercely trying to force the American people to let her into the Oval Office. 
Proving just that, it seems that Barack Obama put on the pressure , on behalf of Hillary's best interest, leading to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange being cut off from communicating with the world. Although the Ecuadorian government severed his Internet access, claiming they didn't want to influence an election and Democrats just shrugged off the matter, the American people could see through the line of crap we were being fed. 
Unfortunately for Hillary and everyone who has lied and deceived in her name, it looks like her campaign is about to come to a screeching halt as the WikiLeaks founder has just promised to get himself some sweet revenge . Now experiencing just how corrupt the left is, Assange claims that his 'next leak will result in the arrest of Hillary Clinton.' 
Let's just hope Hillary likes the color orange because it looks like she's about to spend quite a few years wearing a prison jumpsuit. In all, Assange still has over 50,000 emails to release — and those are just the ones belonging to John Podesta.

This election is arguably the most important our nation has ever faced, and things seem to be reaching a boiling point for America. Proving just that is the bad news Barack Obama just got after the FBI exposed the damning thing he quietly did to Hillary Clinton – and it means trouble for everyone involved. 
As many Americans were made aware on Friday, the FBI has reopened the investigation into Hillary's email scandal. However, a few theories circling the web indicate that the recent turn of events points to something much darker. 
In fact, as Internet sleuths have more time to dig around the deepest corners of the web, it seems as though FBI Director James Comey's hand may have actually been forced when it comes to the investigation. Seeing how both Wikileaks and famed hacker Kim Dotcom have Hillary's 33,000 emails and are intent on releasing them in the upcoming week, the FBI was forced to make a move – but things only get more interesting the further down the rabbit hole we go. 
At this point, the media is taking Wikileaks very seriously, and considering who could be implicated in the leak, something had to be done. In short, the theory suggests that several high-ranking officials up to and including Barack Obama are actually involved in Hillary's little scandal. (Photo Source: Red State Watcher ) 
Although she thinks otherwise, Hillary is actually a very small fish in the big pond of established politicians, and she's about to find that out the hard way. In fact, it seems that Obama may actually be responsible for the FBI pressing forward on the investigation. 
With the theory picked up by Rush Limbaugh , a recent caller expounded on the belief a bit more, saying that Obama was facing a time crunch. In essence, knowing he would be implicated if the full email leak was made public, it would show his complicity in Hillary's illegal behavior, meaning that he has a pretty serious bullet to dodge. I know where Hillary Clintons deleted emails are and how to get them legally @TGowdySC @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump . 100% true. Retweet. pic.twitter.com/eir8r0FJ8M 
— Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) October 26, 2016 
Furthermore, seeing how Kim Dotcom told everyone how officials could legally get their hands on Hillary's emails, this made the reality even more pressing. As more came out, Obama realized the only thing he could do to save his own skin would be to have Comey come forward and say that they 'miraculously' found new emails pertinent to the investigation. 
In order to do this, Obama and the other Democrats involved must have made a joint decision to throw Hillary under the bus. When all is said and done, America will be so focused – with many extremely pleased – that no one will even think twice about what's in the rest of those emails. (Photo Source: Red State Watcher ) 
Although this sounds like a win, many Americans want to turn it into a win-win and take down two birds (or maybe more) with one stone. Those emails are going to come out either way. Although Obama would like to divert your attention elsewhere, justice should come to all of those who break the law.

We've been told lies too many times from both Obama and Hillary, and it seems that the web they weaved is becoming rather tangled at this point. We all know that there is no loyalty in politics unless it directly benefits the person giving it. 
Barack Obama was endorsing Hillary Clinton, but it only stands to reason that the moment he was threatened, he'd throw her under the bus in the name of self-preservation. The jig is up and the Democratic party is going down. Let's just hope the FBI decides to sink those final nails in Hillary's coffin before the election and announce official charges against her. We the people are fed up, and just as Hillary once said, 'No one is too big to jail.' Those words are coming back to bite her in the end.

 After a homeless black Trump supporter was brutally set upon by an intolerant liberal mob, Donald Trump made an incredible announcement. 
A homeless black woman who has been guarding Donald Trump's Hollywood Walk of Fame star from vandals was recently set upon by ruthless liberals, ripping up her signs and assaulting the helpless woman. However, as soon as Trump heard about what the leftist thugs had done, he immediately issued a special announcement that has us cheering. 
After privileged millionaire James Otis obliterated the Donald's sidewalk star on Wednesday, an unnamed homeless woman boldly took it upon herself to act as guardian, making the cold slab her new temporary home. Utilizing her sleeping spot as her own political platform, the courageous vagrant created signs to peacefully showcase her support for Trump. Unfortunately, she underestimated just how savage and intolerant liberals are, especially when it comes to the minorities they claim to champion expressing a different opinion. 
Just one day after the homeless woman set up residence next to Trump's star, a mob of vicious anti-Trump thugs attacked her, RT reports. After pushing her around and stealing her signs, some of the only property she owns, the animals knocked her and her cart down, continuing to hurl sickening insults and snatch things. 
Video captured the enraging assault, showing the woman lying on the ground, shaking, and holding back tears. Fortunately, the heart-breaking story quickly made its way to Trump, the only politician concerned with this transient's well-being. Now, the Republican nominee has made an incredible announcement befitting of a U.S. president. 
The Gateway Pundit reports that Trump was so appalled by the mob's treatment of this destitute woman that he has not only announced that he has a special 'gift' for the victim but promises to seek justice for her barbaric abusers. The presidential candidate's attorney, Michael Cohen, proclaimed on Friday that Trump promises the woman will have 'the last laugh on these thugs.' . @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump someone please help me locate this woman as Mr. Trump has a gift for her… 
— Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) October 28, 2016 
At Trump's behest, Cohen exploded on Twitter, repeatedly requesting followers to find the homeless woman. He explained that they have checked, but she is no longer staying on Trump's star. However, the candidate wants to 'change her life' when he finds her. 
Proving just how passionate Trump is about helping the woman, Cohen spent much of Friday responding to tweets, hoping to find some clue as to the woman's current whereabouts. One user asserted that the woman is Marsha Lee , a resident of Santa Monica. However, it is unclear if this information is accurate. 
Cohen assured that the police are investigating the incident and he and Trump will do everything possible to see that the thugs responsible for the assault are brought to justice. It's truly heart-warming to see such a powerful man going out of his way to do something significant for someone considered 'the least of these.' 
Hopefully, this woman will receive the mystery gift Trump has waiting for her and the savages who bullied an innocent homeless person will be punished for their cowardly behavior. Of course, don't expect Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama to say that her black life matters or even apologize for the thuggery of their own supporters. In fact, neither of them has come forward to help the unfortunate victim of their national policies that never helped her off the streets in the first place. 
This stomach-churning incident just goes to show how tolerant the left is when it comes to blacks, or anyone else for that matter, simply having an opinion with which they disagree.

 An Eritrean asylum seeker to Orsa, Sweden, was found guilty of repeatedly beating and raping a young woman, ultimately impregnating her. However, the court's final ruling proves they are more concerned with the migrant convict than his permanently traumatized victim. 
An asylum seeker brutally beat, raped, and impregnated his traumatized victim only to return later and sexually assault her once more, telling her that he would kill her if she reported him. Unbelievably, the court has not only ruled that he is allowed to stay in the country as a refugee but are about to grant him an outrageous 'consolation prize.' 
As Europe continues to welcome the ceaseless flow of tired, poor, and hungry migrants, a devastating amount of the so-called asylum seekers are using the warm embrace to sink the knife of multiculturalism deep into the backs of their progressive hosts. The left is shocked that the tolerance and respect they bestow isn't returned. Instead, the same brutality and oppression perpetuated in their homelands are brought with the migrant flow. Unfortunately, liberals still haven't figured out that no matter how much they appease their guests, their hospitality will not change millennia of cultural and religious savagery. 
On August 14, 26-year-old Zaid, an asylum seeker from Eritrea, was arrested for the repeated rape and physical torture of a young woman in Sweden. Amina, who is also from a third-world country, suffered severe trauma after Zaid attacked and sexually assaulted her. 
'The kicks hit the thighs, legs and upper body. She screamed for help from neighbors, but she does not know if they heard. The blows and kicks hurt. She tried to break free, but she could not,' the prosecution stated. 
On September 4, Zaid broke into Amina's home in Orsa, poured a pot of boiling coffee over her chest, and punched and kicked her until she was subdued. Again, the migrant raped the poor young woman, this time impregnating her. 
Amina was so terrified that Zaid would keep his promise to murder her that she refused to go to the authorities even after she had an abortion. The abuse finally came to an end when police discovered what Zaid had done, prompting the court to sentence him to a paltry 3 years in prison. However, it's what the court is allowing him to do after 2 rapes, repeated physical assault, kidnapping, and torture that has even some on the left disgusted. 
Fria Tider reports that although Zaid was given 3 years in prison, the liberal judge denied the prosecutor's request for deportation. Not only will Zaid be out in no time and allowed to remain in Sweden on benefits, the court is considering letting him bring his wife and 2 children to Sweden to live with him on welfare as well. 
As Zaid serves his meager sentence, the Swedish Migration Board is already looking over his family members' asylum applications. The board is now considering allowing them residence permits, meaning that they will likely be provided a taxpayer-funded home while their patron is still in jail. Of course, Zaid will be out in no time to live comfortably with his family, never having to lift a finger for his welfare. 
Zaid has shown no remorse for either raping or beating his victim. In fact, he told police that he shouldn't be punished for the sexual assault because 'we just played â we played a love game.' 
Zaid and his victim had met in an asylum center before he began stalking the woman. Ultimately, Amina sustained punches and kicks to the body and face each time before Zaid raped her. Although he was only sentenced for two rapes, investigators believe he subjected Amina to many other sexual assaults. 
'She screamed and screamed but no one came to her rescue. There are neighbors to her apartment. No one has come and responded,' reads the judgment. 
Sadly, this type of leniency is far too common when it comes to migrant criminals in Sweden. On October 19, Mad World News reported that the Swedish Court of Appeals not only freed 3 migrant gang rapists from a 4-year prison sentence but also granted one of them $15,827. 
The appeals court ruled that the district court sentence was illegitimate because the evidence didn't prove 'who did what.' The appeals court concluded that since the third rapist had not acted as aggressively as his accomplices, he should be compensated for wrongful conviction. Of course, the other 2 are also expected to receive financial compensation. 
Earlier this month, a Swedish court freed 5 migrant rapists , concluding that there was no 'probable cause' that they had forced a wheelchair-bound woman to have sex with them against her will. The court deemed that the gang rape could not be legally considered rape because the migrants had not issued 'violence or threats.' 
Likewise, an 18-year-old Muslim asylum seeker was freed after the court found him guilty of raping a 12-year-old Swedish girl . The judge argued that because the rapist had 'some trouble with anxiety and sleep problems,' he should be given just 180 hours of community service instead of jail time. 
Like the rest of Europe, Sweden is sacrificing its own civilians and culture to the most savage foreign nations, all in the name of multiculturalism.

IT'S OVER: Hillary Clinton Wakes To Devastating News Posted on October 30, 2016 by Prissy Holly in Politics  
On Friday, the FBI dropped an unbelievable bomb on Hillary Clinton, announcing they were reopening the investigation into her private server. While Hillary's previous scandals have had little effect to deter her presidential bid,Â that doesn't appear to be the case this time. In aÂ stunning turn of events, newÂ evidence is revealing that Democrats are now turning on Hillary by the droves. 
Immediately after the news hit of the FBI's new investigation, Hillary held a press conference where she urged Americans to 'get out and vote early,' apparently realizing her supporters would change their minds once whatever's in those emails leaks to the public. But unfortunately for Hillary, her evil scheming is not going to get her off so easy this time around. These same 'early voters' she was targeting in her speech have now begun to jump ship, as a devastating new poll reveals. 
Voting is indeed underway. But in several states, not only has the FBI announcement changed their mind or persuaded them not to vote for Clinton, there are many going to the polls to change their votes,Â The Independent Journal revealed.Â 
States allowing voters to change their early votes include many key battlegroundÂ states such as Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Reports are revealing that many earlyÂ voters are flocking to the polling offices to switch their votes, proving that the fallout from the reopened investigation is devastating Hillary's presidential bid. Here's a list of States that will allow early voters to change their early vote following the reopening of the FBI probe. #HillarysEmails pic.twitter.com/ggPZDmgBNw

Even liberal-biased polls are revealingÂ a shatteringÂ impact on Hillary's previous lead. The sameÂ ABC/WaPo poll that had Hillary Clinton up four points Â over Trump early last week now shows them in almost a dead heat.Â As of Saturday, only two points separate the candidates now. 
So just how many voters are switching their ballots to Trump? According to one poll conducted byÂ NJ.com, 24% of theÂ 18,029 people polledÂ said they would be ditching Hillary in the light of recent events.Â While some might argue that the online poll is unscientific, even if half that percentage switches sides, it would guarantee a landslide win for Trump. 
For months, we've been patiently waitingÂ for WikiLeaks to drop a bombshell that would end Hillary. How ironic would it be that in the end, a slime-ball fromÂ Hilary's own party in the form of Anthony Weiner would be the one to destroy herÂ chance of becoming president? It's poetic justice if you ask me.

Breaking: Hillary Admits Guilt With 10 Revealing Words Most People Missed Posted on October 30, 2016 by Alisha Rich in Politics  
Hillary Clinton held a short press conference to address the American people after the news about the FBI reopening its investigation on her secret email server went public. In her short and quick statement, she carefully explained that the American people have nothing to worry about. However, without even realizing it, she incriminated herself by admitting her guilt with just ten revealing words that most people missed. 
Just when Hillary Clinton thought she was in the clear and free from any further questions regarding her criminal behavior, the FBI found more evidence and reopened their investigation on her secret e-mail server. Instead of preparing for the upcoming election and sealing in as many last votes as she can, Hillary's been forced to redirect some of her attention on covering up her own lies. 
During her press conference to address the public, she desperately tried to convince us all that there's nothing to be worried about. An unidentified reporter asked, 'What would you say to a voter who right now will be seeing you and hearing what you're saying, saying I didn't trust her before. I don't trust her anymore right now. And they're heading to the ballot box tomorrow.' 
Hillary's response to this question proved her guilt with it all – and nearly everyone missed it. 'You know, I think people a long time ago made up their minds about the e-mails. I think that's factored into what people think and now they are choosing a president,' Hillary began, according to The Gateway Pundit . 
However, her next ten words are what incriminates her. 'I would urge everybody to get out and vote early,' Hillary said. 
In other words, it must be worse than we thought, and she needs her supporters to go out and vote before the investigation reveals her criminal behavior. She doesn't want the FBI to release more information and sway her supporters to vote elsewhere, ruining her chance to be president. She's guilty and desperate for votes. The only way she can secure those voters is if she convinces her mindless sheep to vote early before all of her dirty deeds become known. 
If I were Donald Trump, I'd be doing a happy dance. The real Hillary Clinton is about to be exposed, and it's all happening mere days before the election.

Neighbors Add To Hillary Sign With Blunt Message Of Their Own Next Door Posted on October 30, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  
When an apartment-dweller decided to use their entire balcony to show their support for the Democratic candidate, their clever neighbors to the right completed it with a blunt message of their own. By incorporating the 'Hillary' sign into a sentence, the people in the building next door made the liberal regret hanging their stupid sign. 
Unlike the sea of Donald Trump signs that fill neighborhoods throughout the country, it's exceptionally rare to see a sign supporting Hillary Clinton for president. Perhaps this person of the top floor of a small apartment building was making up for that by being loud and proud of their criminal candidate, but the people parallel to them won the war of words in a big way. 
John Nolte posted a photo of the opinionated neighbors, noting that he's not sure where these buildings are, but the message they made was very clear. Rather than ripping the Hillary sign down, setting it on fire, or any other destructive act of vandalism that liberals have done to Trump signs, the clever conservative simply completed what the liberal should have said, adding 'Is A Liar' to their windows so passersby read the overall display as 'Hillary Is A Liar.' Photo of the war or words between neighbors, Tweeted by John Nolte 
This statement is not only true but also proves the difference in each candidate's followers when they disagree with something. The Trump supporters didn't make a big deal about the Hillary-loving idiots, they had a sense of humor about it. 
If it was the other way around, the outcome would have been damaging to the resident's personal property and possibly even their person, because ignorant liberals get violent when they feel 'offended' by something. Conservatives fight with facts, as these people did here by pointing out that Hillary is a liar and why they aren't voting for her.

Although the majority of attention seems to be on Hillary Clinton these days, it seems that her entire staff is currently under speculation. In fact, Huma Abedin is in a bit more trouble than she bargained for after the dirty thing she did to the FBI back in June – and it could be coming back to bite her. 
As much of the nation is aware, the FBI recently thrust Hillary's campaign into chaos by announcing that they reopened the presidential hopeful's criminal email case. However, she's not the only one under a microscope. Huma, who is Hillary's closest aide, just got some seriously bad news . Hillary Clinton (left) and her closest aide, Huma Abedin (right) 
For those unaware, the FBI recently announced that they came into some new emails that may be pertinent to Hillary's case. Come to find out, Huma had actually left them on a computer that she shared with her husband, disgraced congressman and alleged pedophile Anthony Weiner. 
However, the bad news doesn't end there as Huma actually said under oath in a sworn deposition that she looked for all devices that she thought contained government work and handed them over to the State Department. With this taking place on June 28, 2016, it looks like Hillary's little helper actually perjured herself in order to defend her boss. 
Unfortunately for her, she seems to be having a rough time.

Hillary Melts Down Over Weiner In Public, PICS Prove Campaign Is Imploding Posted on October 30, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics  
Hillary Clinton's campaign is imploding, and it's so bad that she was caught having a mini meltdown after her press conference as she tried to explain this new email investigation by the FBI, thanks to Anthony Weiner's laptop. As Hillary lost it, her campaign was caught red-handed, doing dirty tricks to pictures, and you'll love just how desperate they have become as they see this election sinking like the Titanic. 
Rumors are flying after Hillary Clinton responded to the latest bomb dropped on her campaign, that thousands of government emails are on Anthony Weiner's laptop. Everyone knows Hillary should have been indicted before, and she had a meltdown of sorts when Kristen Welker of Fox News asked, 'Are you worried this could sink your campaign, Secretary Clinton?' 
While Hillary was walking away from the short press conference after the Weiner email story broke, she stopped and threw her head back and let out a creepy maniacal laugh . Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin found it really weird, saying it was like Hillary had lost it. She described Hillary 'stopping and throwing her head back and laughing, it was really odd.' "Are you worried this could sink your campaign, Secretary Clinton," a reporter shouts as HRC walks out. Clinton only lets out a big laugh. 
— Ruby Cramer (@rubycramer) October 28, 2016 
However, Hillary Clinton was not really laughing. That was a public meltdown, and she is pissed off that an idiot like Anthony Weiner just cost her this election. It's so bad that the Clinton campaign was caught photoshopping the crowd at a recent Ohio rally, where Bill Clinton spoke. Bill Clinton rally Oct. 29th, red arrow shows a man (left) who was duplicated in photoshopped pic put out by Clinton campaign, indicated with red circles (right) 
Then, if all of that isn't bad enough, the Chicago Tribune, one of the most liberal papers in the country, had this headline yesterday: ' Democrats Should Ask Hillary To Step Down ,' which was written by John Kass who was speaking from Hillary's real home state of Illinois. 
'FBI director James Comey 's announcement about the renewed Clinton email investigation is the bombshell in the presidential campaign. That he announced this so close to Election Day should tell every thinking person that what the FBI is looking at is extremely serious .' [via Chicago Tribune ] 
If we are agreeing with the Chicago Tribune, you know what happened on Friday with James Comey and the FBI is so devastating that this election is over for Hillary. However, that doesn't mean we can let up and sigh with relief just yet. 
However, we can be extremely optimistic that, after eight years and two elections that caused utter destruction for our country, we have an extremely good chance that Americans will reject Hillary and her criminal cabal. America was saved by Anthony Weiner, and it doesn't get any stranger than that.

Hillary HQ Gets Massive Surprise Outside Right After FBI Announcement Posted on October 30, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  Hillary Clinton 
Hours after the FBI announced that they are reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mails, the liberals holed up at the Democratic headquarters in Ohio opened their door to a massive surprise outside that they weren't expecting. Now, they're getting the police involved as they fear this is the start to much more unwanted attention from Donald Trump supporters. 
While Trump headquarters in various states have become targets of violence from angry Hillary supporters who don't know how to handle themselves, when the tables are turned, the response is much different. 'What reasonable person thinks this is OK????' party chair Bethe Goldenfield complained in a post in the Greater Cincinnati Politics facebook group with the hashtag #TrumpLovesHate. 'I won't be responding to anyone who thinks this is acceptable behavior. It is ILLEGAL!' she said of what she's taking as a terror attack on their party, but apparently didn't seem to think the same when Trump's party office was firebombed a few states away. 
Sending a very fitting message about what people think not only of Hillary but of the Democratic Party, an unknown individual unloaded a massive mound of manure in the parking lot. Obviously, this person was just giving back a small portion of what Dems have been feeding Americans for years and is symbolic of what comes out of Hillary's mouth, which is why the FBI is now re-investigating her. However, Goldenfield doesn't see the humor in it since it wasn't a molotov cocktail at a Republican office. Manure pile left outside the Democratic Headquarters in Lebanon, Ohio 
According to Cincinnati.com , Goldenfield was alerted to the manure pile by the police in Lebanon who called her at about 7:45 on Saturday morning, which she took full advantage of by urging a widespread investigation to nab the person responsible. 'Hopefully the perps will be held accountable for their actions,' she said, repeating her inaccurate #TrumpLovesHate hashtag. 
The local GOP office came under some speculation of involvement, but not only did they announce that they had nothing to do with this, they offered to help clean it up — something that Democrats didn't offer in Indiana and North Carolina when both offices suffered actual destructive damage, unlike this case of a nonviolent attack that didn't damage property.

Friday was a bad day for Hillary Clinton as the FBI announced the investigation into her emails and private server was being reopened. While news coverage was occupied with the controversial revelation, another one of the Clintons' unlawful dealings was also exposed that many people missed. Hillary and Bill were busted in New York, and their habitual criminality is getting harder to deny. Bill & Hillary Clinton 
Hillary Clinton wants you to believe that she's just like everyone else, but her actions speak louder than words. She's nothing like the average American, and she doesn't think she should be held to the same standards. Her criminal activity proves it, but if you need more convincing, just have a look at what Hillary and Bill were busted for in New York while all eyes were on the FBI. 
After dropping $1.15 million in August for the 3,631-square-foot house next door to their original Westchester home, the Clintons decided it was time for renovations. Originally hiring a contractor for 'a paint job,' apparently turned into so much more when the Clintons' wishlist grew and the duo decided that the work must be done before Thanksgiving. Demanding such a rushed deadline, they apparently also decided that time-consuming permits weren't going to stand in their way. Unfortunately for them, someone didn't like them skirting the law.

An unidentified tipster ratted them out, which brought Building Inspector William Maskiell to their Chappaqua property for an inspection, and he didn't like what he found. The 'Clintons' contractors filled in an in-ground pool, covering it with gravel, and extensively remodeled the interior of the property — all without applying for permits and paying the required fees to the town of New Castle ,' New York Post reports. 
The contractors were quick to point their finger at the Clintons for the missing permits, explaining the pressure they were put under by Bill and Hillary to have the job completed by Thanksgiving. Now, Maskiell says the two face 'several thousand dollars, at least,' in fees and penalties for failing to complete the paperwork. The Clintons were notified of the violations in a letter dated October 17, which disclosed the missing permits and more, according to The Post : 
Attached to the letter was another document titled ' Clinton Violation Inspection Report ' in which Maskiell said the contractor told him the Clintons 'were quite adamant about [the Thanksgiving deadline] and what had started as a paint job turned into this,' meaning the major renovation. 
The outlet further reports, 'Maskiell told the foreman for the contractor, Carl Petty Associates of Washington, DC, that he would not issue a stop work order if the contractor sought the proper permits,' but as of Friday, 'the general contractor still had not filed all of the required paperwork or paid the fees.' Maskiell also explained that, although permit applications are usually submitted by the contractor, the owners are ultimately responsible and must sign the paperwork. Bill & Hillary's original Chappaqua home, purchased for $1.7 million in 1999. 
What's worse, the missing permits isn't the only problem the Clintons are facing regarding their properties. 
The Clintons also have outstanding zoning and Building Department problems at their residence next door at 15 Old House Lane, which they bought for $1.7 million in 1999 to establish residency so Hillary could run for the Senate, Maskiell said. 
They obtained variances in 2000 for a guard house on the property, for a higher fence and for 'lot coverage,' or the amount of space buildings take up on the property. 
The variances must be renewed every five years — but the Clintons never showed up before the Zoning Board of Appeals. 
'Consequently, they are null and void. They should have come back in 2005, 2010 and 2015. So the variances have expired and they have to start from scratch' and reapply, said the inspector. 
The original home and a combination library and gym in an outbuilding still have outstanding building permit issues as well, including a sprinkler 'sign off' by the town engineer and an electrical inspection in the library/gym. 
Many may be thinking, 'What's the big deal?' considering all the other things that Hillary and Bill have been accused of doing. However, it's important to see that, even with the simplest of things, the Clintons don't think the laws apply to them. Their criminality is habitual and never-ending. 
Sadly, this woman, who can't complete even the most mundane task lawfully, is running for President of the United States. Shall I remind everyone that the president, as the Executive Branch of our government, is responsible for implementing and enforcing the laws written by Congress? Someone with no regard for our laws shouldn't be given that power. Hillary Clinton shouldn't be in charge of law enforcement, she should be on the receiving end of it.

30 Mins After FBI News, Hillary Exited Plane… Did One Dirty Thing Before Posted on October 30, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics  
We know that the FBI reopening its investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails couldn't have been good news for the presidential hopeful, but the fact that it took her a whopping 30 minutes to exit her plane after landing speaks volumes on the matter. However, it seems that Hillary made sure to do one dirty thing before walking down those stairs. 
Crooked Hillary is a cowardly schemer – and her recent actions go to prove just that. Mad World News reported Friday that after the news broke of FBI Director James Comey reopening their investigation, Hillary was seen rapidly exiting her plane and ignoring reporters before darting into her SUV.

However, recent reports indicate that her dodging the matter at hand began far before that point . In fact, Hillary's staff made sure to disable the plane's Wi-Fi after the news broke so that the reporters onboard wouldn't learn of the matter until they got on the ground. Of note as we wait for Clinton: plane had no wi-fi today. One adviser after we landed: "We're learning about this just like you all are." pic.twitter.com/CjsH71LJNo

Of course, Hillary made sure to stay far away from the media seats until she got off the plane, but it didn't end there. As reporters had questions about Hillary, an adviser used President Barack Obama's time-old line saying — 'We're learning about this just like you all are.' Clinton's plane did not have WiFi. Her advisors learned about the FBI letter when you did. https://t.co/C0uSXheh1i https://t.co/BAGhckS2aN

Although CNN tried their best to make it sound as if they didn't have Internet access on the plane at all, the Wall Street Journal's Byron Tau came forward saying that Hillary's plane is equipped with Wi-Fi. Hillary has been dodging the consequences of her actions since the beginning of her campaign, but this is a new low for even her. The Hillary plane has wifi. https://t.co/dLZ0tigZhP

At this point, she knowingly put those in charge of getting information to the world in the dark in order to protect herself. Too bad for her, running only gets you so far in terms of justice. She will one day have to face the music. 
As the saying goes – 'you can run, but you can't hide,' and the noose that all those guilty of treason get in the end seems to be getting closer and closer every day.

Monster Vote' Is Happening, Early Voting Poll Numbers You Can't Know Posted on October 30, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics  Hillary Clinton (left), Trump rally (middle), Donald Trump (right) 
For weeks, the mainstream media has pushed a false narrative that Hillary Clinton is so far ahead and this election is over. Luckily, there are some who realized this move is straight out of the leftist playbook and called out the press for what they were up to — lying. No longer can they report Hillary being ahead by double digits. In what's been dubbed 'the monster vote,' here are the poll numbers they do not want you to see. 
What's the monster vote? That's the silent majority in this country who are going to overwhelm all of the liberal talking heads' expectations. We started to see the monster vote for Donald Trump in the primaries, where he attracted voters to register as Republicans to vote in the primaries. 
Now, we have early voting taking place in some states, and those numbers are proving, here comes the monster vote . Gateway Pundit reported: 
DONALD TRUMP Senior Communications Advisor Jason Miller shared some very positive news on FOX News on Sunday morning. 
Jason Miller told Melissa Francis the Trump Campaign is up 100,000 votes in Florida and 35,000 votes in North Carolina compared to four years ago . Trump rally (left), 'We're gonna need a bigger basket' meme (right) 
Let's break that down further to see what it means. Based on all the early voting in Florida, which is a must win for Trump, right now, it's Trump = 51.5%, HRC = 48.5%, which is incredible. Democrats typically rule early voting, and in 2012, at this point, Barack Obama was up by 5% in Florida. Now, for the monster vote news for Florida, as broken down by The Conservative Treehouse (CTH): 
This is YUGE because Obama won early voting in FL by 5 points in 2012 and after election night he won the state by less than 1 point. ( LINK ) Actual in person voting on the traditional election day, November 8th, will heavily favor Donald Trump. 
Folks, based on what we have data wise so far and the fact that the 16 counties didn't start early voting until the 29th of October (which favors Trump based on data above), I can now soundly say that we will win FL by 8 to 10 points (54.5 – 46.5). The monster vote is coming. 
The mainstream media will continue to slant the early voting numbers for Hillary, so don't listen to them. I guarantee you, they are taking a sample and then skewing it. Remember, Democrats almost always vote early, but Republicans don't usually vote until election day. Based on what these smart guys at CTH are saying, North Carolina, Ohio, and Nevada will go Trump and even Minnesota and Wisconsin are slanting towards Trump, which would be just icing on the cake since those states usually go Democrat. 
Tune out the mainstream media on the polls and get ready for the monster vote. It seems to be the best-kept secret in this election. The monster voters are the forgotten men and women across this country who haven't voted in years and are now sick and tired of Washington's corruption invading their life. 
They're back with a vengeance, and they have hope that we can turn this country around. We all agree it will be pure joy on election night as we watch Hillary and her minions break down in disbelief that We the People took our power back and we will never give it away again.

LISTEN: Clinton 'Crime Family' EXPOSED By Veteran FBI Assistant Director Posted on October 30, 2016 by Shae Weatherall in Politics  
On the heels of the FBI announcing its renewed investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails, Veteran FBI Assistant Director and wiretap expert James Kallstrom is speaking out. In his statements, Kallstrom exposes the Clintons as being a 'crime family,' adding credence to the long list of allegations against them for unethical and illegal activities throughout the last several decades. Hillary and Bill Clinton sharing a secret, Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom (inset). 
During an interview with radio host John Catsimatidis, former FBI Assistant Director in Charge, New York Division, James Kallstrom, came forward with some serious statements about the Clinton family. According to Kallstrom, the FBI's original investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails was impeded by the Department of Justice and other top officials in our government. However, now that the case has been reopened, he is apparently seeing it as an opportunity to add his expert opinion and his own insider knowledge of the situation. 
The Hill has provided a partial transcript of Kallstrom's remarks: 
' The Clintons, that's a crime family, basically ,' Kallstrom said. ' It's like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool .' 
' The problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation ,' he said. ' That's the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I'm sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that .' 
' The agents are furious with what's going on, I know that for a fact ,' he said. 
Listen as former FBI Asst. Director Kallstrom speaks about why he supports Donald Trump as president and explains how he knows that Hillary Clinton would be a devastating choice to lead America. 
Among the many statements he made during the full ten-minute interview , perhaps this one was the most profound: 
' It's just outrageous how Hillary Clinton sold her office for money. And she's a pathological liar, and she's always been a liar. And God forbid if we put someone like that in the White House. ' 
Given her extensive and tainted legal and political history, it is truly outrageous that Hillary Clinton was ever allowed to become the Democrat nominee for president to begin with. Now, she's under a second federal investigation for wrongdoing while she was serving as our Secretary of State, and shockingly, there are still those who support her. 
She is obviously corrupt to the core, but hopefully, over the next few days, as more information comes out, people will open their eyes and realize that Hillary's 'campaign' for votes is no different than any other self-serving racket she and her family have been involved in.

Trump's Camp Manager DESTROYS Hillary By Pointing Out 1 Thing We All Missed Posted on October 30, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  Fox News Host (left), Trump's Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway (right) 
From the moment the FBI announced they're investigating Hillary Clinton again, her ship of supporters quickly became lighter with people bailing out to protect themselves from being associated with her as a criminal. Donald Trump's campaign couldn't have asked for better vindication that the witch could soon be incarcerated, but the Republican candidate's campaign manager just put the final nail in Clinton's coffin. 
In the wake of this latest development that could save Western civilization, Kellyanne Conway went on Fox News to discuss it, but she delivered more than viewers were expecting. In a statement that didn't just decimate Hillary's campaign, she brought the entire Clinton family down with it in one perfectly stated sentence. 
When the FBI cracks a case back open that they had previously closed, there's a legitimate reason to be terrified for the outcome of that investigation, and it's almost guaranteed to end in incarceration. Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom validated this when he said after the announcement that the final bomb is about to drop on Hillary within the next ten days. Adding to everything coming back to haunt Hillary since Friday, is what Conway said on Fox News: 
'What we are reminded of is this cloud of corruption that always follows Hillary Clinton and we are having this entire conversation about a renewed FBU investigation because Hillary Clinton did what she always does, put Hillary first…we can never get the stench and the stain of the Clintons off if us it turns out.' 
Call it karma or the combined forces of WikiLeaks, James O'Keefe, and now the FBI, who are all working together to bleach this 'stain' from the White House, but things just aren't looking good for Hillary who had it coming. Hopefully, the FBI who failed the American people after the first investigation that ended with her still being able to run for president, make good on that mistake by actually arresting her after round two. 
The investigation now is entirely different than the first, considering the fact that it was reopened. For that reason alone, Hillary shouldn't feel comfortable about the outcome.

Our nation is out of control, and perhaps the biggest threat is our lax border policy, courtesy of Barack Obama. Proving just that is an illegal alien who managed to sneak his way back into this country after being deported twice. However, it's the sick surprise he had for his girlfriend that landed him behind bars – and hopefully, it's for good. 
It all started when the daughter of illegal alien Raul Perez, 43, got an odd phone call from her father that just couldn't be ignored. After hanging up with her father, Perez's daughter immediately called 911, prompting dispatch to send a few officers to the home of the girl's mother, 31-year-old Karla Guadalupe-Magana, a mother of 5 and Perez's girlfriend. Raul Perez (left), Karla Guadalupe-Magana (right) (Source: Mail Online ) 
Unfortunately, the situation would take a horrid turn as officers made their way into the home to find the woman dead on the bathroom floor with Perez asleep in the bed just feet away. Come to find out, the illegal alien decided to strangle her to death for reasons unknown – but it only gets worse from there . 
According to reports, Perez is actually a Mexico national in the United States illegally and had already been deported twice, but making matters worse, he was actually in police custody just 4 days prior to the murder. Unfortunately, he was released on bond due to a technicality. 
Perez had been arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated, but he reportedly used a fake name to fly under the radar. Although his fingerprints were taken and sent to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), seeing how the agency ' doesn't monitor this type of thing 24/7 ,' Perez was released on bond before the local jail heard anything back. 
Right now, Perez is facing life in prison and deportation once he has answered for his crimes – not that it really does any good. As it stands, this illegal alien could live the rest of his life, leeching off the American taxpayer while in our prison system, because our border is so porous that he just walked across three separate times. If he's deported, that would solve the drain on our taxpayers, but as he's already proven, it also means he could do it all again if our border issue isn't solved. 
This is the type of problem that America is dealing with, and it all stems from Barack Obama's presidency and the man's dangerous policies. Beyond tying Border Patrol's hands behind their backs, our so-called leader has left our nation's border literally open for anyone to simply walk across. 
Unfortunately, because of that lunacy, a mother of 5 is now dead. However, there may be a light at the end of the tunnel if Donald Trump gets elected. Not only will he allow Border Patrol to do its job, he'll build a wall, making it just about impossible for scum like Perez to come into this country – and that, my friends, is exactly what we need.

Hillary Makes SCANDALOUS Stop After Rachel Maddow Breaks Down On LIVE TV Posted on October 30, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics  Hillary Clinton drinking on plane (left), Hillary at Jennifer Lopez concert last night (middle), Hillary at Miami bar today (right) 
Hillary Clinton is getting desperate and so is her lapdog media now that FBI Director James Comey dropped the bomb, re-opening the email investigation. Crazy happenings have just transpired in the last 24 hours, and you'll love Hillary's scandalous stop that's making it so much worse as Rachel Maddow gets caught having a breakdown on live TV. 
Hillary embarrassed herself last night at a free concert given in her name by Jennifer Lopez and her ex-husband Marc Anthony. Hillary came out on stage and pandered so badly to the Latino community that it came off as repulsive. Rachel Maddow cries on live TV over Hillary Clinton's campaign imploding over new email scandal with Anthony Weiner. 
After Rachel Maddow learned that Hillary sustained what she called 'a brick being thrown right at the Clinton campaign,' referring to James Comey's actions, she was caught fighting back tears as another liberal hack tried to convince her that the FBI's decision to re-open the email scandal is a big deal. 
Maddow was hoping he would tell her not to worry and that Hillary can still win, but when she didn't get that news she wanted, she became enraged and then fought back tears. However, it all got worse with what Hillary did this morning. 
This morning, Hillary Clinton was caught making a stop at a Miami bar before noon. That's right, calling it a campaign stop, Hillary strolled into the bar, which looked like a sleazy kind of place, and created even more controversy for the candidate since her drinking has been a sore subject since day one of this campaign. False alarm on missing hillary. She's at a bar in Florida…… Mid day on a Sunday "campaigning" #GoHillary 
— Known patriot (@NCSBM) October 30, 2016 
As Mad World News previously reported, 'WikiLeaks email from her campaign advisor Jen Palmeri to campaign chairman John Podesta seems to indicate that having to sober Hillary up was a routine occurrence. However, since everyone was scared of her, no one wanted to do it.' 
'Should I call her and talk this through or better to leave with you? I'm worried she'll get on with Cheryl and we'll end up in a bad place. I'm in a session that lasts till 3:30 your time. Is that timely or should I walk out?' … 
'I just sent. Was getting my hair cut and trying to write all this on an iPhone. I think you should call her and sober her up some .' [via Wikileaks ] 
Hillary's drinking problems are well known by Washington insiders, so after the last 24 hours, seeing the fallout as her campaign was squashed, making a stop at a Miami bar before noon makes perfect sense. 
Hillary's going to need a lot more than Jennifer Lopez gyrating while wearing a thong on stage and Rachel Maddow crying on live TV to breathe life into her dead campaign. We better be on high alert for some manufactured scandal coming at Donald Trump. Too bad for Hillary, it will be seen for what it is — Hillary and her henchmen trying to save her unsalvageable campaign.

After Trump's Prediction Was Brushed Off Over A Year Ago, It JUST Came TRUE Posted on October 30, 2016 by Dawn Parabellum in Politics  
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made a prediction over a year ago that many brushed aside. Most people, even those on the right, didn't believe the billionaire and real estate mogul at the time, but now that his prediction has been proven correct, many are changing their tune about Trump and actually listening to what he has to say. Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump 
Donald Trump doesn't always say things in the most eloquent of ways. He often speaks what's on his mind with no filter and doesn't seem to care much about who he offends. His politically incorrect way of speaking causes too many to disregard what he has to say, but that's all about to change after what just happened. Trump called this one over a year ago, and now, thanks to Hillary's email scandal, he's been proven accurate. 
The FBI announced Friday that it had uncovered new emails relating to its investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information. This was discovered while conducting a separate investigation into the perverted and disgusting sexting habits of former Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner, who is the estranged husband of Hillary's closest aide, Huma Abedin, who is also front and center in Hillary Clinton's email scandals. 
Donald Trump saw this coming from a mile away, pointing fingers at Weiner as a potential national security threat all the way back in August of 2015. 'It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary's private illegal emails,' Trump wrote on Twitter. ' Huma's PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world. ' Trump has been now been proven right. It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary's private illegal emails. Huma's PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world. 
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 3, 2015 
It looks like the Donald does know a thing or two about politics and corrupt Democrats. In July, Trump said he didn't like the thought of 'Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets.' Trump also sounded the alarm about Weiner as early September 2013, when he wrote that Huma should 'dump the sicko Weiner' because he was 'a calamity who is bringing her down with him.'

Donald Trump's accurate prediction is sure to make waves in the political scene. It turns out that Weiner may bring down himself, his wife, and Hillary Clinton all at once. It never pays to be a perverted and corrupt Democrat. 
Hillary Clinton cannot seem to surround herself with anyone who is not neck deep in scandals and disturbing behavior. It's kind of funny that it's now been revealed that she should have listened to Donald Trump long ago. I bet that doesn't make her very happy at all.

People Shocked At What Hillary Brought With Her To Speech During Scandal Posted on October 30, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  Hillary Clinton landing and speaking in Cedar Rapids, Iowa on Friday 
Hillary Clinton is attempting to forge through the FBI investigation, which she hopes people will soon forget, as she refuses to accept defeat at the hands of Donald Trump. As she carries on with her sparsely-planned campaign stops in the final days of the election, Iowans were shocked to see what she brought with her to her speech right after the investigation was announced. 
No matter how hard Hillary tries, everything she hides seems to have a way of coming out. Karma is certainly working in favor of the American citizens who deserve to know the truth about this woman trying to bully her way into the White House. 
When she was in Iowa this weekend, just hours after the FBI announced they are re-opening the investigation into her e-mails thanks to her right-hand woman's dirty husband, Hillary brought a familiar 'friend' that the public couldn't ignore, which is why photos of it have now gone viral. During the second presidential debate, we were first introduced to Hillary's ironic nemesis, which wasn't just her opponent Donald Trump. 
A fly pestered the Democratic candidate on live TV as she spoke, sticking to her and never touching Trump in what seemed symbolic since she stinks of lies and everyone knows flies are attracted to garbage. As embarrassingÂ as this may have been for Hillary, she can't pass it off as a random event since it happened again in a completely different state. That's right â while she was in Iowa, a fly once againÂ wouldn't leave her face. Can't even make this up. How many times has a FLY landed on Crooked Rotten Hillary now?!

Apparently, there's something about Hillary's face that flies flock to. and it's probably the same thing most Americans find so repulsive. It's not coincidental that this has now happened twice to this candidate in less than a month, and perhaps the fly is just a sign of what the FBI investigation is about to uncover. 
Like a crow symbolizing death, the black fly during this election represents the end of Hillary's campaign since it seems to sense everything she's trying to hide.

BOMBSHELL: Hillary Clinton's Leaked Audio Proves She Rigs Elections Posted on October 30, 2016 by Dawn Parabellum in Politics  
Astonishing, newly released leaked audio of Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has just surfaced, and what it reveals is damning. In her own voice, we hear the corrupt Democrat telling reporters that elections can and should be rigged to ensure who wins. This throws the validity of every government on earth in the shredder because she isn't only talking about rigging American presidential elections. 
Since the FBI reopened their investigation into the criminal Democrat and Hillary seeks a powerful position to dictate the lives of others, it's important to hear this audio. She is blatant when she say elections shouldn't take place unless we make 'sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.' 
Hear it from her own mouth: 
Hillary clearly said, 'I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. ' 
This conversation took place in 2006 during a discussion with Eli Chomsky, an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press. At the time, Hillary Clinton was running for a 'shoo-in re-election' as a U.S. senator. 
Her trip, making the rounds of editorial boards, brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. Her conversation was secretly recorded, and the audio hasn't been released until now. 
According to Chomsky, this little audio clip has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. He claims his copy is the only copy and no one has heard it since 2006 — until now. Election rigging Democrat, Hillary Clinton 
It proves she is willing to do whatever it takes to win. With massive amounts of voter fraud already being reported in favor of the most criminal and corrupt politician of our time, in combination with this audio, it's hard to deny that Hillary wouldn't rig the election to win. 
Luckily, Americans are wising up to her disturbing antics. We all saw her cheat during the debates , and the proof came out in leaked emails, thanks to WikiLeaks. 
It's important to hear this, coming directly from Hillary herself, and we can all tell that it is her voice. We all know she's rigging this election to beat Donald Trump, but she obviously has had her hands in rigged elections before. 
It is hard to say how many elections across the globe she has influenced or just stolen. Hillary Clinton will stop at nothing to grab even a small amount of power, and she continues to prove she is as corrupt as they come.

Bad News For Hillary After Camera Caught Why She Gave Strange Men $300 Posted on October 31, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  Man from video (left), Hillary Clinton thinking she got away with it (right) 
Hillary Clinton can't seem to escape the karma that's coming her way as the days are dwindling down to the election, and with each one, something else comes out against her that she can't escape. After the FBI dropped the ball on the first investigation, they're redeeming themselves the second time around, and now it's out what she paid strange men $300 to do. 
The hits just keep on coming at Hillary. If she gets off the hook again this investigation in addition to everything WikiLeaks has released about her, then we know that there is something seriously corrupt with our government. 
Worse yet would be if she's elected as president, which will force Americans to pay an exceptionally detrimental price for the next four years that could bring lasting implications. The man in this video knows who may have helped in that destructive outcome, done for a small fee that Hillary's campaign evidently handed out like candy for this cause at a halfway house in California. 
MicroSpookyLeaks came forward with the footage they obtained, when they posted it to social media on Saturday which shows the unnamed person in this video admitting what Democrats were giving halfway house patients $300 to do for them. While this man in the video may not have accepted the payment himself, he's caught saying that Democrats are giving others in the house a $300 rebate check if they vote for Hillary in the state of California. DEMS caught paying patients from a halfway house $300 rebate to vote for HRC in CA! pic.twitter.com/qpxgNt6KgR 
— MicroSpookyLeaks™ (@WDFx2EU7) October 29, 2016 
This is just one place where cash was probably offered for votes. We can only imagine that if her party is willing to do this there, they hit up other places and people in key states to do the same. What's particular sick about it isn't just that they are fraudulently obtaining votes for this woman who can't get them on her own merit, it's that they are targeting vulnerable people to get them as part of the dishonest plan. 
If Hillary is able to continue on with this campaign and take the White House, Americans have the duty to demand how it happened since there's no way she could legitimately win. Had Donald Trump been caught bribing halfway house patients for votes or any of the other dishonest deeds leaked out about Hillary lately, the media would have exiled him from the election.

 A photo of Hillary Clinton with some police officers popped up on social media over the weekend, but people were divided in their reaction to it. The post on the Facebook page for the Medford Police Patrolmen's Association caused controversy and backlash online over the content and what the was seen being done to crooked Hillary. The post showed Medford Police officers at the Fall Festival in Haines Square on Saturday. The photo was done in fun and captioned, 'Look who MPD grabbed at the Fall Festival in Haines Square today…' This image is an accurate depiction of what we all would like to see: Hillary in handcuffs. As you can plainly see, the photos show police officers with a woman in an orange jumpsuit, handcuffed. It appears that they are arresting someone, who wore a mask in the likeness of Hillary Clinton. Screenshot from the Medford Police Patrolman's Facebook page 
In a second photo, the police officers posed with a person in a Donald Trump mask, with the caption, 'Making America GREAT again in West Medford Square!!' Screenshot from the Medford Police Patrolman's Facebook page 
Since a fair amount of overly sensitive pansies made a big deal about the posts, Harry MacGilvray, president of the Medford Police Patrolmen's Association, decided to apologize for making the post. 
'These were Halloween costumes. It was meant totally as a joke. I apologize if this offended anyone in any way,' MacGilvray said in a statement. 'I never expected this sort of reaction. It was poor judgment on my part.' 
The posts have been removed to avoid hurting the feelings of overly-sensitive liberals. While most of us see the humor in these images and understand how insane it was to apologize for the posts that were clearly done in jest, liberals don't see things this way. 
They go out of their way, looking to be offended. If the police posed with a handcuffed Trump, it's pretty obvious that there would have been no outrage, because conservatives aren't easily offended by free speech. However, a liberals sole purpose seems to be finding things to be offended over, and they have done it again.

Hillary Clinton thought her email scandal was in the rearview mirror, but it just blew up in her face days before the election. Unfortunately for her, everything just got worse as a bombshell just exploded – and seeing how the topic is about prison, it looks like things are about to get juicy. 
There's no doubt that Hillary is as crooked as they come. Although the left would have you believe otherwise, with the presidential hopeful all but admitting her criminal acts, not too many people believe them. 
However, things just got a lot worse for Hillary, but his time, it's not only her presidential campaign that's in jeopardy. According to The Economic Collapse , Hillary Clinton is looking at a whopping 20 years behind bars if she's convicted of 'obstruction of justice' – a term that could very well be a life sentence for a woman of her age. A sight we may get to see soon, and one that Hillary Clinton rightfully deserves 
As of this point, no one is mentioning the phrase 'obstruction of justice,' but that doesn't mean the idea isn't floating out there. In fact, when you look at the actual definition of the term in regards to the Federal statute, you start to get a better idea of just how guilty Hillary is: 
Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsified, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under Title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. 
We already know that Hillary is guilty of trying to cover this up. Not only did she delete and 'bleachbit' her server in a desperate attempt to block the FBI from finding out her dirty little secret, but then she said she didn't have the emails they were looking for. 
Of course, when others stumbled across the mythical 33,000 emails, things started to take a turn – and it all just got worse. According to The Wall Street Journal , the FBI now has another 650,000 emails to sort through with about 10,000 pertinent to Hillary's case. Things aren't looking so good for Hillary Clinton 
Why did FBI Director James Comey find the need to come forward with this information so close to the election? Well, as it turns out, the answer is rather simple – redemption. 
According to a Daily Mail article written by Ed Klein, the author of a bestseller about the Clintons entitled Guilty As Sin , it seems as though Comey was suffering for letting off Hillary so easy. As explained by Klein: 
'Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,' said the source. 'They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist. He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom.' 
Further speculation pertaining to Comey's reasoning seems to indicate that the urgency here stems from the information actually found. Knowing just how much the release would impact the election, one can only assume that Comey was only comfortable in doing so as someone had already found something really big. 
The fact of the matter is, people had lost faith in justice after Comey's dismissal of Hillary's charges. After proving that power meant exclusion from the law, it seems as though the FBI Director is trying to right that wrong today. Furthermore, as there seems to be something of substantive nature, Hillary can expect to be facing 20 years behind bars – a sentence a great many people would feel is justified.

After the FBI's Friday announcement that they had reopened their investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server, many have been quick to attack director James Comey for the timing of his recent move. However, Trey Gowdy just obliterated the criticisms while also delivering a nasty surprise directly to Hillary herself. 
The Democrats have come unhinged as they watch their candidate sink, with the FBI's reopened investigation delivering a devastating blow to an already disastrous campaign. In fact, what's coming out of their mouths as they enter panic mode is almost laughable. Take for instance Howard Dean's claim that Comey is in cahoots with Vladimir Putin or Harry Reid's suggestion that director Comey broke the law. 
It's rather ironic that he's concerned about Comey following the law while, at the same time, basically suggesting Hillary should get a free pass. In fact, Reid is so concerned about the FBI director's actions in investigating Hillary Clinton's criminality that he had the nerve to write Comey, attempting to intimidate him. 'I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election,' Reid wrote. 'Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.' 
Luckily for us, Trey Gowdy was ready to call Reid out for his crap, and of course, it's all on video for us to enjoy. Watch: 
Gowdy wasn't falling for the left's excuses, and he said what we were all thinking. First, he laid into Huma Abedin's excuse that she didn't know how her emails could have ended up on a device she says belongs to her husband. As Gowdy points out, there aren't that many ways it could happen, but it's rather irrelevant since that's not what the FBI is investigating. 
Next, Gowdy took out John Podesta for his 'blame the cops' play, and then came the nasty surprise for Hillary. Gowdy reminded viewers that Comey isn't responsible for a single one of the facts , saying, ' He didn't tell her to use a private server, he didn't tell Huma not to turn over all of her devices, and God knows, he didn't tell Anthony Weiner to send sexually explicit texts to allegedly underage people. ' Gowdy continued to put Hillary on blast, saying ' The timing is a direct and natural consequence of decisions Hillary Clinton made ,' reminding everyone of where our focus and blame should be. But, he wasn't done there. 
It was then Harry Reid's turn to feel the Gowdy heat as the senator ripped into Reid's asinine letter to Comey. 'Thank God he's leaving is my initial reaction,' Gowdy said about Reid before adding, 'My second reaction is: I did not know Mormons used drugs, and anyone who is capable of sending out that press release has to be under the influence of something.' 
Then, Gowdy went right back to putting the attention and blame where it needs to be — on Hillary Clinton. ' The person responsible for this fact pattern is Secretary Clinton ,' Gowdy explained. 'Jim Comey did not tell her to use her private server. He did not say to mislead the public about whether or not you turned over all of your work emails. And he certainly didn't say, Secretary Clinton, why don't you say you neither sent nor received classified information.' 
Trey Gowdy successfully obliterated any critics of the FBI and director James Comey while also delivering Hillary the nasty surprise she deserves. Although she's used to skirting consequences, she has no one to blame for what's happening besides herself, and it's nice to see that there are those in Washington, D.C., who are more than willing to wrap up some personal accountability and drop it directly into the presidential candidate's lap. Timing wouldn't be an issue if her own actions didn't lead our entire country down this path. Hillary Clinton has no one but herself to blame for what she's facing. As for timing, now maybe Mrs. Clinton has a little idea what it's like to be aborted just days before delivery.

Michelle Runs Her Nasty Mouth At Trump, Then Karma Smacks Her In The Face Posted on October 31, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama at Clinton's campaign stop in North Carolina 
Michelle Obama has been hot on the campaign trail to help Hillary Clinton replace her corrupt husband, proving that Democrats care more about power than the American people. After dropping everything for 'her girl' Hillary and running to North Carolina to speak on her behalf, Michelle ran her mouth about Donald Trump, but it immediately came back to bite her. 
While Trump is capable of doing his own talking and campaigning, Hillary needs a lot of help to make it through this election season, and she's getting it from a number of Democrats, namely, the Obamas. Both Michelle and Barack Obama have campaigned for the ailing criminal candidate numerous times, including at her North Carlina stop on Thursday where Michelle acted as Hillary's sorority sister more than her campaign supporter, after completely bashing Trump. 
According to the Daily Mail , the two 'First Ladies' acted as if the campaign stop was a teenage popularity contest as they stood on stage like a couple of best friends, who are actually enemies. Only able to discuss what makes Hillary so great by trash-talking Hillary's opponent, Michelle said, 'We want a president who takes this job seriously and has the temperament and maturity to do it well. Someone who is steady. Someone who we can trust with the nuclear codes.' 
Apparently, Michelle wasn't paying attention to the presidential debates when her gal pal committed treason by spilling what America's nuclear response time is. Seemingly forgetting who she was talking about and all that this woman is accused of, sanctimonious Michelle rambled on about what an awesome example Hillary is for our children as if we're supposed to take parenting advice from a mother who raises her daughters around foul-mouthed rappers. 
'We know the influence our president has on our children,' she later added. 'They turn on the TV and they see the most powerful role model in the world – someone who shows them how to treat others. How to deal with disappointment. Whether to tell the truth. They're taking it all in.' In making this statement, she didn't realize she was actually speaking against Hillary, who is the opposite of the honest role model she described. The label is more fitting for Trump. 
She closed her speech with a declaration of desperation, pleading with the crowd that if nothing else, choose Hillary because as 'First ladies, we rock.' Then, she begged anyone who would listen to keep 'working your hearts out for my girl.' This little cheerleading act is very convenient, but it backfired on Michelle when the past came back to haunt her. Hillary isn't 'her girl.' In fact, they're 'frenemies' at best since she was previously recorded talking behind Hillary's back, saying, 'If you can't run your own house, you can't run the White House,' in reference to Bill Clinton's extra-marital affairs. 
Like 'her girl,' Michelle proved herself as a hypocrite in her statements and got a huge dose of karma the next day for supporting Hillary when the FBI announced they are re-opening the investigation into the Democratic candidate's e-mails. Neither one of these two women or their husbands are 'powerful role models' who 'tell the truth,' and they certainly aren't people any child should be looking up to.

8 Catastrophic Signs Reveal Hillary's Campaign Is IMPLODING Posted on October 31, 2016 by Prissy Holly in Politics  
For months now, we've been patiently waiting for the scandal that would finally bring down Hillary Clinton. With the media constantly in her back pocket, she's miraculously been able to keep anything from sticking. However, in an ironic twist, a member of her own party in the form of Anthony Weiner appears to be the force that will finally deliver the death blow to Hillary's presidential bid. 
Over the weekend, we got the incredible news that the FBI would be re-opening their investigation into Hillary after new pertinent emails were uncovered while authorities were investigating Anthony Weiner. Although Hillary would love for everyone to believe that everything is just peachy and she's on the road to victory, there are catastrophic signs beginning to emerge, revealing that Hillary's campaign is literally imploding from within. 
Just in time for Halloween, here are the top 8 signs that show Hillary's campaign is blowing up in her face, and that the long-awaited karma train has finally begun to run her over. 1. Hillary's Right-hand Woman Huma Abedin Is Suddenly MIA 
It's rare that we ever see Huma departed from Hillary's side, but the love affair between the two appears to be crashing down, now that Huma's own husband Anthony Weiner is the wrecking ball that's currently crashing through Hillary's campaign. According to reports, Huma has voided her immunity deal with the FBI, meaning that she has two choices: start singing or face jail time. Hillary obviously doesn't want Huma around to tarnish her campaign, and in the light of everything imploding, Huma is nowhere to be found. 2. Rats Are Jumping Ship 
Even Democrats are starting to renounce their support from Hillary. On Sunday night, prominent Democratic pollster Doug Schoen, who advised Bill Clinton and worked on Hillary's campaign from back in 2008, announced he would be withdrawing his endorsement. Schoen went on to say on FOX news that he 'fears a constitutional crisis' should Hillary be elected into office, while still under investigation from the FBI. 3. Early Hillary Voters Are Switching To Trump 
Reports are now flooding in revealing that many early voters in key swing battleground states such as Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania are now switching their votes to Trump. The search on Google 'change early vote' is now beginning to trend. According to one alarming poll, 24% of the 18,029 people polled said they would be ditching Hillary in the light of recent events. 4. WikiLeaks Promises Leak This Week That Will Put Hillary In Jail 
Hillary's incredibly been able to downplay the majority of WikiLeaks' influx of incriminating email dumps over the past few weeks. Now, WikiLeaks is promising the long-awaited 'October Surprise' that will hit sometime this week, along with the assertion that what's in these emails will land Hillary in jail. 5. Trump Is Slaughtering Hillary In Florida 
It's absolutely imperative that Trump wins in Florida if he's to secure the number of electoral votes necessary to defeat Hillary. While Hillary and the Democrats flaunted their early lead in that state several weeks ago, Trump is now up by a whopping 4 points. His lead skyrocketed after the FBI's announcement of their reinvestigation into Hillary's private server. 6. Hillary's Hitting The Bars 
What better way to drown out the reality that you're losing then slamming back a few whiskey sours? During a campaign stop in Florida where only an embarrassing handful of people turned out to see Hillary, she hit up a Florida bar in the middle of the day where she was seen knocking back liquor-heavy drinks. 7. Hillary Loses 11 Points In ONE WEEK 
Liberals love their polls, but even with their heavily-biased fake numbers that previously had Hillary in the 'lead,' even they cannot keep up the lie anymore. In a catastrophic new poll from Washington Post/ABC, Hillary has dropped an astounding 11 points in ONE WEEK! Oh, the horror! 8. Voters Are Screaming 'LOCK HER UP!' 
Before hitting up the bar in Florida, Hillary was greeted by angry voters who began chanting 'lock her up!' True to form, Hillary just ignored the group of angry Americans, while plastering on the biggest fakest toothiest smile she could muster. 
It's so wonderful when karma finally comes calling. Unfortunately for Hillary, it looks like her dose of karma is deciding to hit with just a little over a week before the presidential election. Oh, how sweet it is! Follow Us On Social Media Search

Trick-Or-Treaters Get Their Socks Rocked By BADASS Hillary Pumpkin Outside Posted on October 31, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics  
An incredible video is being shared on social media after someone wanted to go political with their jack-o-lantern carving this year. Unfortunately for Hillary Clinton, this badass pumpkin seemed to center around her – and it will surely knock the socks right off any trick-or-treater headed to their house tonight. 
Halloween is a fun time for many people – especially families with younger ones. However, it seems that a few homeowners decided to try and entertain the adults that may cross their path. Proving just that is a video shared to the Facebook page called ' Uncle Sam's Misguided Children ,' which shows how one person went political with theirs. 
As can be seen in the short clip , the jack-o-lantern was emptied and carved to look like a set of jail bars. Making it just that much better, the person responsible for carving the pumpkin actually stuffed a picture of Hillary in there to make it appear as though she is in prison – where she belongs. 
Within just a few short days, the video has already been seen over 3 million times with that number on the rise. However, if you think people on social media are ramped up over the ingenious carving, you can imagine the reactions that thing will get from trick-or-treaters tonight. 
As it turns out, the cool idea actually sparked a bit of a movement with several other people doing the same. In fact, in order to make it crystal clear, others even wrote the words 'Hillary 4 Prison' on their creations as well:

Huma Abedin Sent Top Secret Docs To Yahoo Acct, Possible 'Life Insurance' Posted on October 31, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics  
A laptop, allegedly belonging to Huma Abedin's estranged husband Anthony Weiner, reportedly had thousands of emails from Hillary Clinton's private server as possible 'life insurance' against the corrupt Democrat. We've uncovered shocking details behind what Huma did and why she did it as well as explosive information about FBI Director James Comey's secret war that the liberal media is keeping from you. Huma Abedin (left), Hillary Clinton (middle), Anthony Weiner (right) 
After the New York Police Department was notified about Anthony Weiner sexting an underage girl, they had to investigate, and it was then that they discovered a laptop with over 650,000 'metadata points' and about 10,000 emails overall, which were from the State Department and coming from Hillary Clinton's home based server. Huma Abedin most probably kept those emails hidden on that laptop for life insurance against evil Hillary: 
[W]as the laptop in question one of the missing laptops from the Clinton email investigation? One can easily imagine a scenario where this could be the case … One can also easily imagine a scenario where the content therein would be kept by Abedin for a reason; especially by a person who knows EVERYTHING about the extent the severe black hat Clinton's are willing to go to retain their power. [via The Conservative Treehouse ] 
The leaks in this new investigation involving Huma Abedin are coming from the New York police, probably a few detectives who were shocked when they found top secret documents on the laptop when investigating Anthony Weiner, and they are driving the FBI to move forward because, if the bureau doesn't, they will come out and tell all Americans what they know. Also, there is clear evidence that FBI agents were in revolt after Hillary was let off scot-free, and they were going to leak this information too, if Comey did not re-open the investigation. 
What is it they know? They know Huma Abedin was probably keeping insurance in case Hillary ever turned on her, and Huma was thinking the FBI investigation was over and no one would ever find that laptop with her 'life insurance.' Then in late September, Weiner did his illegal sexting thing, and before Huma could collect the laptop with the secret documents, the New York police had seized it. Huma Abedin's testimony, subpoenaed by Judicial Watch. She admits to using her Yahoo email account for State Department business. 
Just 11 days before Comey rocked the world on October 28th, announcing he was re-opening the email investigation, he sent out a clue that this is what he was going to do, but we all missed it . Check out this shocking FBI report that Comey released just 11 days ago about Hillary Clinton, which he called the final report on the email scandal: Page(s) 43, 44, 45 – Show aspects of the perspective of Secretary Clinton as she rebukes her security apparatus and puts her diplomatic team at risk. Also the alarming influence of Huma Abedin into security and protocol changes. Page 49 – Discusses the people within the highly secretive '7th Floor Group,' and how they handle security information Page 54 – Discusses the missing boxes of printed Clinton Emails. Page 56 – Discusses how the Secretary of State's Office runs a secondary U.S. government , separate and apart from the traditional political structure, actually called 'the shadow government.' FBI Director James Comey finds himself all alone, fighting against Hillary and her cabal. 
'A shadow government ,' what the hell is going on? This sounds like some nutjob conspiracy theory, yet this is exactly what Comey released to the American people on October 17th. He was letting us know that Hillary and her cabal are evil and they need to go. 
I think James Comey is the hero in all of this. At first, we hated him because it seemed he had given into the Obama administration's evil ways, but all along, he kept fighting, and when Anthony Weiner dropped that laptop at Comey's feet, it was like a gift from God himself. 
The fight isn't over. We are seeing Hillary and her minions fight back against this new investigation, and I think Comey still has his hands tied, but he is doing what he can. Hopefully, those FBI agents and New York cops who are privy to what it is in Huma's Yahoo email 'life insurance' file will leak the information before the election. 
We can see, without any doubt, from Comey's 'final report' that Hillary is a tyrant and she must never be in power again. Let's spread all this information because the strongest defense against Hillary's evil is the truth, and as more Americans learn this truth, there is no way she will win.

WikiLeaks Initiates Phase 3: The Dump That Will Take Hillary Down   Dawn Parabellum   Corrupt democrat, Hillary Clinton 
WikiLeaks is putting Hillary Clinton and the corrupt Democrats who surround her on notice. With a warning sounded last night about the initiation of 'phase 3' from the website, which has been leaking devastating emails about Hillary's insiders, the 'election dump' promises to be the one that brings her to her knees. 
Wikileaks announced on Twitter that it would soon launch 'phase three of [its] election coverage.' The tweet also asked those who wish to see more dumps to donate to the site to assist with their funding. The tweet read, 'We commence phase 3 of our US election coverage next week.' We commence phase 3 of our US election coverage next week. You can contribute: https://t.co/MsNZhrTzTL @WLTaskForce pic.twitter.com/XferJnMGux 
— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 30, 2016 
This dump is supposed to be even more damaging to the already flailing political career of Hillary Clinton. Wikileaks supporters now include a number of disgruntled Republican voters and Bernie Sanders supporters. 
Immediately after the site announced this dump, several WikiLeaks followers replied with tweets expressing hope that phase three would ultimately damage Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton 's campaign for good. However, some expressed concern that it could be too little, too late. @wikileaks @WLTaskForce by next week, I assume you mean tomorrow, and not 3 days before the election. Near 30%+ in some states already voted 
— Mel (@melimel521) October 30, 2016 
New archives of emails released to the public would definitely devastate the Clinton campaign even further, and after the FBI's announcement that they will reopen the investigation against Hillary, it could be the straw which breaks the camel's back. 
So far, no amount of corruption or criminal activity has gotten devout Democrat voters to see Hillary for who she is: a power hungry sociopath. She has been caught rigging elections across the globe and cheating to get the Democrat nomination. It's even been proven, thanks to WikiLeaks, that she cheated during the debates against Donald Trump . 
There is some speculation that the emails released this time won't all be Hillary Clinton related, eluding to the possibility of even more Democrats and their corruption being exposed. Hillary Clinton's rigged podium helped her cheat during the debates with Donald Trump 
Hackers who have taken responsibility for the hacks of John Podesta's emails may have more up their sleeves. Guccifer 2.0, who claims to be a lone Romanian male, was also involved in the hack on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
Hopefully, these leaks will finally get Democrat voters to realize who they have been bowing down to over the past few years. Accessing the leaked emails is not difficult, in fact, I personally check the new dumps daily. If Democrats cared half as much about honesty and integrity as they did about making sure we have the first female president, Hillary would already be no more than a stain on American history.

Hillary Shows Her Guilt After Hearing Trump Supporters Chant 3-Brutal Words   Alisha Rich   
After decades of scandals, Hillary Clinton's corruption seems to be finally catching up to her. Unfortunately for her, it's all going down mere days before the election for her desired presidency. As she faces this harsh but deserved reality, she encountered several Trump supporters in Pompano Beach, Florida, who chanted 3 brutal words, and her reaction is proof that she's guilty of it all. 
With only a little over a week to go before America votes for our next president, Hillary Clinton's campaign is publically imploding. It seems even her most devoted fans are questioning her actions, and their uneasiness will only increase once they see what she did when she encountered several Trump supporters chanting, 'Lock her up.'

Obviously, she's been living in her own corrupt world for many years and believes she's untouchable. However, people are now finally seeing who the real Hillary Clinton is — a crook and a criminal. When she encountered the vocal Trump supporters at an early voting site and heard what they were implicating, her reaction is exactly how a guilty person would respond – she ignored them, plastering that fake grin across her face. She ignored the folks screaming "Lock her up!" pic.twitter.com/SpgHvawvUr 
— Roberta Rampton (@robertarampton) October 30, 2016 
Of course, some people may argue that her reaction is what anyone would do, but I believe the contrary. If you're innocent, you're going to want everyone to know you didn't do it and vocally deny any unexpected accusations. Of course, Hillary does the opposite as she has many years of practice on how to ignore people who call her out for her wrongdoings. 
Clearly, when FBI Director James Comey dropped his bombshell, reopening her criminal investigation, Hillary became frantic and desperate. She knows what she's done and how guilty she is. 
Now, all she can do is pray nothing more comes to light before the big election. Sorry Hillary, not even your followers can be that dumb. I think it's safe to say, Comey just handed Donald Trump the presidency.

Little Boy Humiliates Himself With What Sick Liberal Mom Made Him Wear Posted on October 31, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  @DebbersGar (left), the woman's son in humiliating attire (right) 
While all of the other children are showing up to class today dressed as their favorite cartoon characters or superheroes of some kind, an ultra-liberal mother used her son to make a sick statement instead. Too young to understand agendas, the little boy humiliated himself in front of his class, which he will have to live with the rest of the school year. 
School administrators have a responsibility to report it when they feel something is wrong at home, which some would think is probably the case with this boy based on what this twisted woman dressed him as. Instead of being given the choice to be whatever he wants, his seemingly controlling mother convinced him to don what she thought was a pretty cool costume without thinking about the emotional damage it could do to her child. 
The liberal mother, who goes by @DebbersGar Â online, was proud that she got her son to dress up as her hero, Hillary Clinton, when she posted his photo online with the description, 'Our 8-year-old son is with you @Hillary Clinton, today and every day.' Adding to the realistic nature of the female costume, she grew her boy's hair out so it could be styled in Hillary's signature winged bouffant. She completed the androgynous costume with a pantsuit, Hillary campaign pin, and slogan briefcase, then topped it off with a pair of pearlescent girl shoes. The 8-year-old boy dressed as Hillary Clinton in his mother's post 
While the look is atrocious regardless of gender and has no place in a second-grade classroom, the fact that she more or less forced her son to dress as a woman makes it worse â but it's par for the course with gender-bending liberals. 
While she made her political point and was clearly proud of it, her son likely sat alone at lunch and played by himself at recess in his yellow woman's pantsuit, but she'll blame other people's 'bad' parenting for raising kids who treated her son this way.

BAD NEWS: Hillary's Pimping Past Exposed, Dirty Whoring Details Leaked Posted on October 31, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics  
If Hillary Clinton thought she was in big trouble with the FBI, she's got another thing coming when she hears what's just around the corner. In fact, it seems as though the presidential hopeful's pimping past was just leaked – and every whoring detail is out there for the world to see. 
Hillary is no saint, despite what she would have you believe, and her apparent pimping past goes to prove just that. According to a recent leak, it seems that the female presidential wannabe is used to whoring out certain entities – so long as she gets to stuff her pockets. 
So, who exactly did Hillary force to grab their ankles so that she could rake in millions of dollars? Well, America – more specifically, the American working class. As explained by The Daily Caller , Hillary accepted a whopping $28 million donation to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for 2 favors granted to the country of Morocco. Bill Clinton (center right) and Hillary Clinton (center left) greet Mohammed VI, King of Morocco (right), and his sister, Lalla Meryem (left) 
Come to find out, the first part of the payment came in at $15 million from the country's King Mohammed VI. Just after that, Hillary miraculously got to work on the Mosaic Company – America's largest phosphate mining facility. For those unaware, phosphates are used in a variety of products but are most well known for being used to make fertilizer for farmers. 
As it turns out, one of Morocco's largest bases for income just so happens to be the selling of phosphates that they illegally rip from their lands. In order to put pressure on Mosaic, in hopes of shutting them down, Hillary deployed the use of both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in an effort to deem the group an 'environmental threat' to our country. 
In order to do so, Hillary had the DHS fly planes low over Mosaic's operations in order to spy on them. From there, EPA chief Lisa Jackson got to putting the crunch on the organization by making their lives a living hell in every single way. Hillary Clinton 
In the meantime, Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to relax U.S. foreign aid restrictions on Morocco, thereby allowing the country to expand operations into phosphate mining. By the end, the American company was to be shut down, forcing America to look elsewhere for supply – which, if you can connect the dots, would be where Morocco would come sweeping in. 
Fortunately, Florida politicians were able to fight back and put the brakes on before tens of thousands of Americans were negatively influenced by the devious deed. However, Hillary and the King of Morocco weren't done there as he pumped another few million into the Clinton Foundation's account. 
As explained by The Daily Caller : 
An email WikiLeaks made public last week illustrated how Clinton, while acting as secretary of state, negotiated an additional $12 million donation to the Clinton Foundation from Muhammed in return for holding the 2015 Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) meeting in Marrakech, Morocco. 
Hillary also managed to squeeze another $1 million out of the King to cover the expenses of the CGI meeting. As one would imagine, the recent leak hasn't made too many people happy, and it exposed how Hillary has been whoring out our nation any way she can in order to further fill her own pockets. 
According to Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, 'these facts seem to reveal the possibility of more pay-to-play activities at the Clinton Foundation.' Personally, I don't understand why we can't call this what it is – bribery. 
Using fancy terms takes away from the criminal behavior that Hillary has been complicit in. Furthermore, she has proven that she is perfectly comfortable with illegal behavior – as well as pimping out the American people, specifically the working class – so long as she benefits from it. If she did all this in just the short time she was Secretary of State, I shudder to think what she will do with the full power of the presidency behind her.

 A Trump supporter was arrested after polling officials spotted what he was wearing at an early voting station in Bulverde, Texas. 
As the election draws near, liberals are attempting to stifle any votes for Hillary Clinton's increasingly popular opponent, Donald Trump, hoping their felonious candidate can pull off a win. However, what a Trump supporter was recently arrested for wearing shows just how desperate leftists really are to stop the conservative vote. 
When Brett Mauthe woke up last Monday morning, he was eager to get his ballot in early and secure a vote for Trump while the Republican nominee's approval rate continues to rise. The 55-year-old Texan got dressed, put on his favorite hat, and headed out the door. Unfortunately, he didn't realize that it was his choice of clothing that would not only prohibit him from voting but also land him inside a jail cell. 
KSAT 12 reports that Bulverde polling officials confronted Mauthe when they spotted him wearing a pro-Trump hat and a t-shirt that read 'Basket of Deplorables,' a sarcastic reference to Hillary's crude remarks about conservative voters. Apparently unaware that he wasn't allowed to sport campaign gear inside the polling station, Mauthe removed his hat but refused to turn his shirt inside out. It was then that the officials called the police and had him arrested. 
Mauthe was placed in cuffs and charged with electioneering and loitering as local police threw the book at the confused man. Like Mauthe, voters at the same polling place were shocked that wearing such clothing is not only prohibited at the polls but can result in a misdemeanor charge . Brett Mauthe, 55, was charged with electioneering and loitering for wearing a 'Basket of Deplorables' t-shirt mocking Hillary Clinton's crude reference to conservatives. 
'I don't feel like you should be preaching to anybody, but I do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate,' Georgina Pereida said after casting her vote Wednesday morning. 'I'm kind of shocked because I think that's part of the freedoms that we're voting for. ' 
While Mauthe is wholly responsible for not following the rules, although he may not have understood the severity of his violation, we're betting that career politicians are keen on the election rules. Proving that the liberal elites are above the rules, Hillary herself was caught breaking the same law as Mauthe but with a very different outcome. This year, Hillary was caught campaigning in front of a North Carolina polling station and Bill was busted thanking Hillary voters over a loudspeaker within 20 feet of a Massachusetts polling station. Unlike Mauthe, neither of the Clintons were arrested. 
Mad World News reported that Hillary was captured on video campaigning in front of Raleigh's Chavis Center, a polling place in North Carolina. The female candidate walked straight up to early voters, greeting them and snapping selfies as if she was at one of her own rallies. Of course, the scheming doesn't end there. 
In March of this year, Bill was busted thanking 'those of you who are supporting Hillary Clinton' with a loudspeaker while within 20 feet of a Massachusetts polling station. His massive police detail also blocked civilians from entering the precinct to vote. The Daily Kos reports that even though electioneering, which is Mauthe's crime, is only a misdemeanor, interfering with voting rights is a felony, which is exactly what Bill did. As expected, Mauthe was arrested and charged for his crimes, but Bill was fawned over and even abetted by police officers. 
Although Mauthe definitely broke the law when he refused to remove his shirt, his real crime is that he wasn't a Hillary supporter. If he had been a liberal celebrity or the husband of a Democratic politician, he would've been allowed to block voters and openly campaign for his choice right there in the station. 
The bias is clear â not only are the electronic polling machines switching votes for the left, influential Democrats are potentially changing views right there in the polling stations. It's undeniable that, regardless of the results, the American people don't stand a chance at a fair election.

Top Hillary Official Leads Prayer Chain Hoping To Save Imploding Campaign Posted on October 31, 2016 by Prissy Holly in Politics  
Democrats are constantly attacking Christianity while fighting to have God completely removed from our institutions, and evidence of their godless agenda was on full display during the Democratic National Convention, when they removed all references to God. However, now that Hillary's campaign is imploding, Democrats are evoking the name of God, as a last-ditch effort to save her campaign. 
It doesn't take a brain surgeon to see that Hillary and her presidential race is going down in flames. She continues to drop in the polls, while many of her previous supporters are now ditching her and flocking to early voting stations to cast their votes for Trump. As things progressively spiral out of control in the aftermath of the FBI reopening their investigation, chairwoman for the DNC is now calling on Hillary supporters to evoke the name of God and pray for 'divine intervention' to save crooked Hillary's deteriorating presidential campaign. 
Shortly after news broke of the FBI's decision, chairwoman Donna Brazile immediately jumped on Twitter, leading liberals in somewhat of a social media prayer chain for Hillary. As evidenced by the heart and retweet buttons, Hillary's supporters echoed the sentiments of Brazile's desperate plea for God's divine intervention to save Hillary's imploding campaign. Please God, let this end soon 
— Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) October 30, 2016 
Unfortunately, Brazile wasn't done mocking God quite yet. It looks like she even dusted off her Bible to find a verse she could twist for her political use, as she then blasted lines from the book of Psalms, accompanied with a frantic message to Hillary supporters to get out and vote. Exhaling every time I get distracted. Let's work until the midnight hour. Are you fired up and ready to vote? Keep you eyes on the prize! https://t.co/wnSixsJYu3 
— Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) October 30, 2016 
Now, I'm no Biblical scholar, but I do know that God explicitly states in the Bible that he will not be mocked. Being that the Democratic Party is the epitome of evil as the original proponents of slavery and abortion, it's truly asinine that these idiots think God is suddenly going to have their backs and assist them with getting the evilest and vilest person on planet earth elected into the White House. 
Trump supporters were quick to catch the absolute irony of Brazile's Twitter antics and immediately began firing back with some hilarious responses of their own: @donnabrazile Please golden, sweet Jesus… #DrainTheSwamp quickly!! Let's all #MakeAmericaGreatAgain and get these criminals out of here! pic.twitter.com/wsf3zx26LL 
— Erica AmERICA (@EricaMelone) October 30, 2016 @donnabrazile Yes let's pray! Pray for God's justice and that @HillaryClinton is put in prison where she belongs! 
— ☆ Prissy Holly ☆ (@PrissyHolly) October 31, 2016 @PrayInFaith This is true if one is serving The God of Abraham, Isaac & Jacob! Does God support reprobate & criminal behavior? 
— Joe Butler (@jdb1964) October 31, 2016 @PrayInFaith I can't imagine God would want a corrupt person such as HRC running this country. 
— Deplorable Kimie (@kimieand) October 31, 2016 @PrayInFaith God cannot honor this corruption which is out there for all eyes. I pray for America to be protected from her. 
— Lou Stevens (@LouMalpagato) October 31, 2016 
Nice try, Democrats. Maybe if you hadn't made it your number 1 priority to erase God from our schools and governmental institutions in recent years, He might look down favorably upon you now, in your darkest hour. 
As for me, I will continue to get on my knees every night, begging for God's mercy and asking not for my will but for His will to be done. Being that God is on the side of justice, I seriously doubt that if Hillary does manage to win, that He would have had anything to do in assisting in that devastating outcome!

Hillary In Prison Costume Annoys Liberals After They See Whatâs Behind Her Posted on October 31, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics  
A womanâs Halloween costume is going viral after she snapped a quick picture and posted it to Twitter. Although a few panties were in a wad because she dressed as Hillary Clinton wearing a prison jumpsuit, liberals just about went into full meltdown after seeing what was behind her. 
The image was actually seen on the social media account of The Blaze reporter and famed conservative commentatorÂ Tomi Lahren Â after she shared one of her videos from Facebook. 
As it turns out, one of her subscribers had a picture that made for the perfect response. As can be seen, a woman decided to dress up as Hillary Clinton in a prison jumpsuit â but thatâs far from the complete picture. 
— Mr. Cards (@MrCards007) October 21, 2016 
Hitting her point home, it seems as though the womanâs significant other decided to dress up as Donald Trump, who was actually hauling Hillary Clinton off to jail. The visual created reflects Mr. Trumpâs promise given during the second debate when he said that he would put her in jail. 
Of course, others seemed to have loved the idea so much that they decided to duplicate the idea while putting their own spin on things: so my parents dressed up as trump & Hillary for prison for the costume party… pic.twitter.com/9RVAx4834z 
— Faith Sampson (@Faithh_Sampsonn) October 29, 2016 
Even a few kids got involved with the Halloween costume idea: Happy Halloween ! đťđ 
— Donald J. Trump (@P0TUSTrump) October 31, 2016 
With everything thatâs come out during the recent days, thereâs only one place that Hillary Clinton deserves to be. Between compromising the security of the American people through the use of her illegal email server to whoring out our country to fill her pockets, there isnât a single person who can argue that this woman is a criminal. 
Fortunately, it seems that FBI Director James Comey recently found his backbone and decided to actually start holding Hillary accountable. Letâs just hope Trump wins this election by a landslide and can follow through with that promise to lock Hillary away once and for all.

 Adam Aliev had a sex change operation before marrying his male lover. However, after his brutal murder by an anti-LGBT 'bigot,' don't expect to hear a peep from the liberal media. 
A young transgender, who recently had surgery to become a woman, was found brutally hacked to pieces and completely unrecognizable at a gruesome murder scene. However, as soon as the liberal media found out the identity of the suspected killer, they fell eerily silent about the major news story they'd otherwise blast across the airwaves. 
The liberal agenda is clear — propagate everything that promotes their progressive ideals. However, when it comes to Islam, the left has an incredibly difficult time defending its teachings since they almost always oppose liberal values. Once again, the left has proven that ratings and the already soiled reputation of their favorite religion are more important than even their own beliefs. 
From a young age, Adam Aliev believed he was meant to be female. Unfortunately, his family was not supportive of his decision to live as a woman, to say the least, but this only empowered Aliev to undergo a sex change operation and take the name Raina. Sadly, shortly after 25-year-old Aliev made the transformation and married his male lover, he was brutally murdered for his lifestyle. While all of this fits the liberal dream of pushing a victimized LGBT poster children in an attempt to demonize conservatives, the leftist media won't be flooding social media with Aliev's face for one crucial reason. 
Naira Naija News reports that not only is Aliev's disapproving family made up of devout Muslims, his father is also suspected of being responsible for his son's heinous murder. Aliev was reportedly butchered and hacked into pieces just after his father Alimshaikh Aliev rallied other devout Muslims on live television to honor kill his transgender son. 
'Let him be killed, I don't want to see him. Bring him here and kill him in front of my eyes,' the father ordered. Aliev's passport shows him before his surgical transformation, the final straw that prompted his Muslim family to demand his gruesome murder. 
Shortly after the broadcast, police confirmed that Aliev was 'cut up' into pieces and unrecognizable to those who knew him. 
'I did not recognize Adam's cut-up body when it was brought to the village,' an official said. 
Aliev was born into a Muslim Chechen family in Dagestan, a Muslim-dominated area in the Russian Trans-Caucasus. According to Alimshaikh, his son's decision to live as a woman and marry a man had apostatized him from Islam, which the Quran teaches is worthy of execution. 
Although it is unclear whether Alimshaikh is an actual murder suspect, he is undeniably responsible for bringing about his son's death, which could and should result in criminals charges. 
According to Daily Mail , Aliev's mother was reported to be 'crying day and night' after she heard about his sex change and un-Islamic wedding. It was then that the father publically broadcasted a 'purman,' which is an invitation for Muslims to kill a particular person. 
'He cheated them, he went there to Moscow, had surgery and he turned from a boy to a girl,' said a female neighbor of the victim's father. 'And now in Chechnya it is known too. His mother is saying 'I don't want to see him, I gave birth to a son, but what for? It is such a disgrace for the family.' If the mother and father give a purman, it means they want him to be killed.' 
Muslims are responsible for 91 percent of the world's honor killings, which have motives ranging from marrying against their family's wishes to simply insulting Islam by becoming 'too Western.' In fact, even the family's Muslim neighbor believes that Aliev's actions are so dishonorable that they warranted his death. 
Mad World News reported in December 2015 that a 23-year-old Muslim woman brutally drowned her 2-year-old daughter after she caught her own father raping the child. The little girl suffered severe internal injuries before the mother walked in on the girl's 59-year-old grandfather sexually abusing her. The woman drew her still bleeding daughter a bath and held her underwater until she stopped breathing because she wanted to 'avoid scandal.' This is just one example of the sinister measures Muslim will go to in order to preserve their religion's idea of honor. 
While the left claims to be the champion of LGBT rights, don't expect them to make a fuss over Aliev's death. As they have consistently proven, Islam trumps the LGBT community. Either because they are terrified of Muslims or because they are blindly ignorant of the ideology, liberals will likely come to the defense of Islam over its transgender victim.

Hillary Horrified As 2 Pics Surfaced Overnight That She Didn't Want Out Posted on October 31, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  Worried Hillary Clinton (left), Vindicated Donald Trump (right) 
Hillary Clinton got a Halloween surprise early when she turned on her computer and saw what was on Google. While she slept, forgetting about everything that came against her on Friday when the FBI decided to re-investigate her emails and private server, someone else was taking full advantage of the situation and exposing the truth about her as two posts showed. 
After Barack Obama gave control of the Internet to International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), Hillary may have thought that her secrets would be safe. As WikiLeaks continues to prove, that couldn't be further from the truth. Clever conservative web users are alive and well, working hard to expose the secrets that she's enjoyed keeping behind closed doors before the Internet came along and swung them wide open, exposing the scandalous and criminal behavior that she almost got away with. 
Since Google tends to lean left and caters to liberal agendas, it's not often that the search results you're looking for are all that accurate. However, on Sunday, almost 36 hours after news broke about the FBI investigating Hillary, if you were to search two separate terms, the results were awesomely accurate. 
A tricky hacker managed to mess with the algorithm so that if anyone was looking for the definition of 'pathological liar' on the popular search engine, the top result showed Hillary's headshot alongside the description, but that wasn't all. @triplejHack What in the Wide World of Sports is going on with Google!? pic.twitter.com/PJHC23CzDK 
— Dilo on Fire (@FireDilo) October 31, 2016 
The definition of this term said, 'It is a stand-alone disorder as well as a symptom of other disorders such as psychopathy and antisocial, narcissistic, and historic personality disorders, but people who are pathological liars may not possess characteristics of the other disorders. Excessive lying is a common symptom of several mental disorders.' While that description may always come up in Google for 'Pathological liar,' Hillary's picture isn't typically there, but it is the perfect example of the mental illness. 
Adding to the insult was another search result the hacker altered for better accuracy. When searching for who the '45th President' is, Donald Trump's picture showed up, which Hillary probably wasn't too happy about. The comparison between the two searches perfectly represents both presidential candidates. With any luck, the results will stay the same after November 8 and the treatment for Hillary's diagnosis of 'pathological liar' will be prison time.

Hillary Dressed In The Most Perfect 'Costume' Today Without Realizing It Posted on October 31, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  Hillary Clinton in 'costume' 
For the first time in her campaigning, Hillary Clinton is working overtime, now that we're in the final hours of this election and she has a major FBI scandal to try to cover up. She's not letting a holiday like Halloween hold her back from her scheduled speaking engagements, scaring everyone she meets with what she inadvertently decided to dress up as. 
The troubled Democratic candidate showed up at Kent State University to greet another anemic crowd that she's become accustomed to seeing. While she thought she was treating them with her presence, the 'trick' was actually on her when everyone took a closer look at what she was wearing and saw the irony in it based on everything Americans have seen over recent weeks. 
While she didn't depart from her typical androgynous pantsuit garb, there was something else about her outfit hidden in plain sight. As the American Mirror point out, every inch of the draping fabric she had on was crimson red, making her appear like she dressed as a walking blood clot for Halloween. 
Since clots have been suspected as contributing to her health issues, which she's had a hard time hiding, the irony of the outfit wasn't lost on those looking for deeper meaning in what she picked to wear on this particular holiday. Hillary Clinton in all crimson red at Kent State today on Halloween 
According to The Sun , Hillary has been known to have clotting issues in the past when they reported on this condition in September. 'Clinton had a long history of ill health starting with a blood clot in 1998 while her husband Bill was commander-in-chief,' the source explained. 'The 'Venous thromboembolism', which was located behind her right knee, resulted in her foot ballooning in size.' 
The article added that Hillary is on a daily regimen of blood-thinning medications to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 'after suffering two other clots in 2009 and 2012,' one of which was discovered in her brain. 
The symbolism potentially runs deep in this color choice as it's one of her few appearances she's made since Friday when the FBI announced that they were looking back into her e-mails, which possibly mean the end of the road for her. Red represents anger, which she surely feels inside, or perhaps it's a hidden message that the election will end with a win for Republicans whose party is represented by this bold color.

Hillary's So Pissed At FBI, But Here's The 1 Person Who Really Screwed Her Posted on October 31, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics  
Hillary Clinton and all of her supporters are freaking out over FBI Director James Comey's recent re-opening of the email scandal investigation, saying he has new information coming from a forgotten Huma Abedin laptop. Hillary is so pissed, she has been on a tirade, blasting Comey and Donald Trump, but she forgot one thing — and that is the one person who really screwed her. Hillary Clinton is pissed off. 
Poor Hillary Clinton, since stepping into the White House back in 1992, she has imagined herself sitting in the Oval Office as the one with all the power. She has conspired and broken laws, killed men in Benghazi, and lied about their deaths, but now, it looks like its all for nothing. 
If only she could live in reality for 20 seconds, she would realize the one person who screwed her was staring back at her in the mirror. Everything that has happened is because she decided or rather insisted that all her crimes involving her own home based server be covered up. 
She was warned when she became Secretary of State that all emails having to do with government business must go through the 'dot gov' system. She had to take a class on how to handle classified documents, and after the class, she had to sign a document confirming that she understood all of her work emails must stay on the 'dot gov' system. 
Why? Was this just a stupid rule that had no real life consequences? No. People's lives are at risk. Our troop's movements are in those emails. The information about CIA spies, who are risking their lives in foreign countries, are in those emails. Who needs a class to understand what is at stake? 
So, how can she get pissed off about this investigation and say over and over 'it was a mistake, there is no case with the FBI'? A mistake? A mistake is an action or judgment that is misguided or wrong. Intentionally going against all protocols and putting the lives of others in danger is a crime. Hillary Clinton in August 2015 
Here's what Rush Limbaugh said: 
'They've nominated somebody that's under constant FBI investigation, and there are four different investigations into the Clinton Foundation. Do not doubt me when I tell you that within the inner circles of the Democrat Party, they are very worried about this. Even if she gets elected, they're very worried about it, because of what it portends for her presidency. This woman is corrupt. She and her husband are constantly engaged in things that place them under investigation, for 30 years .' [via Rush Limbaugh.com ] 
Hillary is so pissed off, but for those of us who have suffered through watching her tear apart this nation, sell influence to foreign entities in the 'pay for play' scandals, leave our men in Benghazi to die while blaming it on a video, and lie under oath numerous times, well, we couldn't be happier. 
American women have no business voting for Hillary as the first woman American president. What kind of a legacy is that for our daughters and granddaughters? How will those women who backed her and voted for her ever explain that the first woman president was the biggest criminal ever to hold that office? 
She is a monster, and I'm tired of her supporters crying now that it's falling apart. The only person to blame is Hillary Clinton, and anyone who can't see her clearly is delusional. No one made her commit crimes that she needed to cover up with a home based server. Put her in prison, where she belongs, and throw away the keys.

As a Spirit Airlines flight prepared to take off from Fort Lauderdale International Airport in Florida, passengers boarded and attempted to get comfortable. However, it only took one observant passenger's quick glance to realize the entire flight was in trouble after he spotted what was on a Muslim man's phone. 
Autumn Lynn was aboard the flight when she heard a man three rows behind her begin to scream for a flight attendant. It quickly became clear that an 'older man of Middle Eastern descent' had been texting a friend about a bomb on the plane – and the petrified man immediately freaked. 
'We are about to take off and three rows behind me there is a man of Middle Eastern descent that sent a message from his phone which said 'the bombs are ready,'' Autumn explained on a Facebook Live video, which was taken while she was on the plane, according to Daily Mail . 'They have brought us back to the gate, and we're waiting to be evacuated. He's still on the plane.' 
Eventually, the pilot declared an emergency evacuation and passengers were taken off of the plane. Autumn witnessed the flight attendants confiscating the man's cell phone until the Broward Sheriff's Office deputies arrived, nearly two hours later. 
'They pulled the man off the plane, he was an older man, of Middle Eastern descent,' Autumn explained. 'They ripped him out of the seat and dragged him off the plane.' 
The Sheriff's deputies confirmed the aircraft was checked for any threat and cleared. Thankfully, the man's texts were false. Unfortunately, for the passengers on the plane, their departure was delayed for over six hours before it took off for their final destination of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. Reportedly, no arrests were made. 
Although nothing resulted from this particular incident, it's better that the proper precautions were taken by both the flight crew and the deputies to ensure nothing happened on the plane. It's better to be safe than to be sorry –especially when we're talking about the lives of many innocent people.

Since the story broke on Friday that the FBI is renewing the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails, Huma Abedin suddenly became strangely absent from Hillary's campaign. In fact, it seems she has vanished. The next tweet features another 'missing person' style meme and notes, ' According to the Clinton Foundation, she was recently believed to be suicidal, however, Huma has no history of depression. ' Clearly, the creator was taking a sarcastic jab at the impossible coincidence that so many people close to the Clintons have committed suicide.

While the former is most likely the truth, the internet is exploding with memes and tweets, which have been created by users who were obviously inspired by the rumored 'Clinton Body Count' list and have added in a good amount of sarcastic humor too.

Now that the FBI hasÂ what is most likely the missing 33,000 emails, we can be reasonably sure that actual, lawful justice is on the horizon as well, and there isn't a hashtag on Earth that will be able to save Crooked Hillary or her favorite minion, Huma, from facing the consequences of their actions.

BLM Rapper & Bill's Alleged Son Have Nasty Surprise For Hillary Posted on October 31, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics  
It looks like when it rains, it pours, and Hillary Clinton is now facing a big problem with Black Lives Matter. It all stems from an alleged affair Bill Clinton had with a black Arkansas prostitute, which produced a son. Now, after years of trying to find out the truth about his biological father, the rumored son's cause is being taken up by a black rapper, and they have a really bad surprise for Hillary. Rapper 'Freenauts' wears 'Hillary for Prison' t-shirt while performing rap song 'Justice For Danney Williams' 
The BLM rapper 'Freenauts,' wearing a 'Hillary for Prison' t-shirt, put out a video, performing his rap song 'Justice for Danney Williams,' referring to Bill Clinton's alleged lovechild. The video has just over 100,000 views, but now that it is the last week before the election, Donald Trump supporters, as well as Black Lives Matter supporters, are posting it all over social media. 
The plight of Arkansas resident Danney Williams has been around for years, and in the past, Hillary's henchmen put out disinformation to the press to make it seem as if Williams claims had been proven false. 
In fact, Danney Williams has never had a DNA test, and many in the media are now realizing that not only does Williams resemble Clinton but his story rings true. Up until Bill Clinton became president, Williams recalls with great detail the Christmas presents Arkansas troopers would bring to his house from then-Governor Bill Clinton. Growing up, Williams was told by his mother and even his teachers that he was Bill Clinton's son. Rapper 'Freenauts' artwork for his song 'Justice For Danney Williams' (left), Bill Clinton & Danney Williams (right) 
With Hillary taking a hit this week, she can't afford to lose any of her support from minorities, especially the African-American community. Unfortunately for her, it looks like that may happen after WND made this announcement from Williams: 
Danney Williams, the man from Little Rock, Arkansas, who has claimed since the 1990s to be the black illegitimate son of former President Bill Clinton, will hold a press conference Tuesday at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., to make an announcement his supporters characterize as a 'bombshell that will rock Hillary's campaign.' 
On October 19, WND reported that lawyers representing Williams, in the hours before the third and final presidential debate in Las Vegas, announced their intention to file a paternity suit demanding DNA evidence from the former president. 
It looks like Hillary may be in for a drop in support by African-Americans after Williams describes her as the mean woman who chased his mother away from the Governor's mansion when he was only a few years old. It may be a day of reckoning for Hillary as everything that can go wrong is all happening at once, and we couldn't be happier. May Hillary get everything she deserves and then some.

 Sadiq Mohammad, 20, thought it would be funny to dress up as a clown and terrorize civilians. Unbeknownst to him, he would be the one getting the scare of his life. 
After hearing about the creepy clown trend sweeping the nation, a Muslim man decided to start off Halloween by donning a 'killer clown' costume and attacking unsuspecting victims. However, as soon as he approached his next target, he quickly realized that not every infidel is going to take his idiocy lying down. 
Just last year, a Muslim prankster thought it would be funny to use his inherently violent and historically deadly religion to terrorize innocent civilians for laughs and views on his social media accounts. In December, a group of YouTube tricksters, dubbed the Jalals, dressed in traditional Arab attire and hurled suspicious packages at random strangers , making them think they were about to be bombed. Drawing from this idea, a fellow YouTuber decided to hone in on the creepy clown trend, chasing down petrified bystanders for his own entertainment. Unfortunately for him, he got his own dose of terror when he picked on the wrong man. 
Sadiq Mohammad, the 20-year-old Muslim mind behind the YouTube channel HoodClips, donned a sinister-looking clown mask and filmed himself stalking unsuspecting onlookers on the streets of Stockton, California. As expected, most of his targets ran away in horror. However, one man decided not only to fight back but turn the terror back on Mohammad. 
Guns.com reports that Mohammad was given a brutal taste of his own medicine after his intended target pulled out a firearm and pistol-whipped him in the head. The Muslim prankster leaped out of the bushes in an attempt to startle the unknown man, immediately discovering that he would be the one fearing for his life. 
'Why you gonna play that s**t in Stockton, brother?' the man asks. 'That s**t done-a** played out, bro,' he adds, referring to the recent spate of clown pranks. 'I ought to pop your dumb a**.' 
According toÂ Daily Mail , Mohammad instantly regretted his bullying attempt, running for cover as the hooded individual graciously allowed him to retreat without further injury. Realizing that some people don't find his joke at their expense amusing, Mohammad has now sworn to hang up his clown costume for good. 
'Lesson learned is, people donât play with the clown stuff,' Mohammad told KCRA . 'Like, people really will shoot anybody.' 
Unfortunately, there are some who say that the man's reaction wasn't justified. Sacramento attorney Kresta Daly alleges that 'pulling a gun was too much' since Mohammad claimed that the tactics were just part of a prank. Of course, Daly refuses to acknowledge that just because a threatening individual says that their behavior is part of a prank doesn't mean they're telling the truth. 
Just 2 days ago, a San Diego man told police that he was stabbed multiple times by 4 people dressed up as clowns. The victim was left with gashes in his left cheek, right shoulder, and lower abdomen but is expected to make a full recovery. 
Similarly, a 16-year-old was stabbed and killed by an assailant in a clown mask in Reading, Pennsylvania in September. The teen was attending a party when a fight broke out, prompting an unknown suspect in the costume to repeatedly stab him. 
Mohammad is lucky to be alive after his incredibly idiotic stunt. Of course, it's probably not going to stop him from abusing innocent civilians if it means he can make money from their misfortune. After all, it was the Islamic prophet Muhammad, after whom the YouTuber is named, who exclaimed that he has 'been made victorious through terror.'

Sex Bombshell Exposed After Hillary Couldn't Hide What She Did Back In 2011 Posted on October 31, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics  
Hillary Clinton is backpedaling these days, but her past isn't making things any easier on her. In fact, it seems that her dirty deeds from 2011 just came to the surface in the form of a sex bombshell – and not even she could hide it forever. 
With the FBI reopening its investigation into Hillary's emails and private server, on account of another case into Anthony Weiner's sexting of an alleged minor, it seems that there are some startling details coming forward. Although we all know that Weiner is a long-time pervert and sexual predator, it looks like things have been going on for longer than we thought – and Hillary knew about it all along. Everyone who knew Anthony Weiner targeted underage girls back in 2011: John Podesta, Neera Tanden, and Hillary Clinton (left), and Jennifer Palmieri (right) 
According to Mail Online , Hillary's camp knew that Weiner was talking to and sending sexually graphic images to an underage girl all the way back in 2011, yet they did nothing to stop him. In fact, Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign communications director in 2011, sent an email to John Podesta, now chair of Clinton's presidential campaign, and Neera Tanden, another Clinton adviser, detailing Weiner's predatory and criminal behavior. 
Married to Hillary's current top aide, Huma Abedin, at the time, Weiner's indiscretions were made public knowledge to Hillary's camp and only met with a mere 'oof' from Podesta. Further reports indicate that police were sent to the 17-year-old girl's home at the time to interview both the child and her parents. Anthony Weiner and his sex pics 
Of course, as we all know now, Weiner has come under official investigation after sending lewd messages to a different 15-year-old girl more recently. However, one can only wonder if Weiner's most recent victim could have been spared if his predatory behavior was addressed back in 2011 rather than swept under the rug. 
Although he's been widely deemed the black sheep of the political realm, it certainly appears that his divorce and early resignation was the least of concern pertaining to the fallout of his behavior. Seeing how the most recent of Weiner's consequences just slapped Hillary, it doesn't take much to imagine the hell he's living in right now. Anthony Weiner and steamy messages he sent to a woman other than his wife 
However, it is good to have these things out in the open as it helps show the true Hillary Clinton – the one she never wanted you to know about. There's no question that Hillary would do whatever it took to remain in power, but this is just ridiculous. 
Because of her neglect and the blind eye turned by her staff, an underage girl was allowed to be victimized because the truth would have a negative effect on them. There really is no jail cell that's suited for what Hillary deserves but she will most certainly have to answer for her misdeeds after she's dead and gone from this earth – and suffering for an eternity sounds rather fitting for the vile things she's done.

Hillary's Secret Is Out With What Camera Caught Her Doing Before Rally Posted on November 1, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  Screenshots of Hillary Clinton in alarming cell phone footage 
There's a reason Hillary Clinton doesn't let certain people have cell phones around her, but no matter how much she tries, she can't control everyone. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker doesn't care about her recording 'rule' as he caught her in the act with his cell phone camera. Now that the alarming video is out, so is her nasty secret. 
It's safe to say that Hillary is dealing with a lot of stress as the campaign she thought she had sufficiently rigged in her favor slips out of her grasp, now that she's under FBI investigation. It's becoming harder for her to hide who she really is, despite having done a pretty good job of it up until this campaign, but now we know how she deals with her many challenges after what Booker recorded her doing right before a campaign rally. 
The Democratic candidate was in New Jersey on June 1 for one of her few campaign stops at the time and seemed to have some 'help' with getting through the challenges of her day. After getting out of her black van, she walked right up to the Senator who she could probably see was recording, acting as if she had not a care in the world as she sang and awkwardly danced for the camera looking rather drunk, despite it being the early afternoon.

As Hannity.com described the strange footage, 'the video captured and shared by New Jersey Senator Cory Booker ahead of a June 1st rally in Newark, New Jersey shows an unusually jovial Clinton singing and dancing shortly before appearing with rock musician Jon Bon Jovi.' While it's not the first time she's been suspected of day drinking to the point of intoxication before it's even 5 p.m., it's just added proof that she can't seem to cope with her campaign or much of life in general, without alcohol. 
When you live as dishonestly as Hillary has, the only way to avoid the guilt of her decisions is probably to stay a little — or a lot — tipsy throughout the day. That's unacceptable behavior for anyone, but especially someone who is trying to be the leader of the free world. America doesn't need a drunk president.

Genius Kid Trolled White House Halloween Party, Idiot Obama Didn't Notice Posted on November 1, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics  
During certain holidays, Barack and Michelle Obama invite a few kids to the White House to join them in the festivities. However, the most recent incident wasn't like all the rest as one kid decided to troll everyone there with a genius costume idea – and our idiot president didn't even seem to notice what he did. 
Yesterday, a few kids were invited to the White House Rose Garden in order to dress up for the annual Halloween trick-or-treat event. Although most kids were there for the candy and games, there was one costume that stood above the rest – a duck. 
Now, this wasn't exactly your typical duck costume with a kid inside, and he wasn't your ordinary kid either. As can be seen in a picture posing with Obama, the duck was actually bandaged with its arm in a sling, thereby actually making it a ' lame duck .'

Of course, Obama is about to adopt that name after the election as he begins the home stretch of his presidency. Although he hasn't done anything except for forcing his legacy down America's throat, these are the few months where slacking off is actually accepted from a man in his position. 
At this point, a few things are unclear, including whether this kid was suggesting that Obama was a lame duck for his entire presidency or if our so-called Commander-in-Chief actually caught the genius pun. While some say he took the comedic jab with a bit of humor, others suggest the moron missed the subtle trolling entirely as it was just one of the endless droves of children in costumes that he took a picture with. 
It's unknown who was actually in the costume or if the idea came from the child or their father, but it's being shared around social media for good reason. Obama has been nothing but a lame duck for the past 8 years after idiot voters actually believing the 'hope and change' spiel voted for the man twice. 
Fortunately, his days of freeloading and kicking back are about to become a thing of the past. Although nothing will change during his 'lame duck' months, freeloaders of our nation are about to get a kick in the backside when Donald Trump is elected. We have been doing nothing for far too long – it's time we kick things into high gear and actually do some great things, just like we used to do.

Liberals Brag With Pic Of Hillary, FURIOUS At What Snuck In Behind Her Posted on November 1, 2016 by Alisha Rich in Politics  
It's been a rough week for crooked Hillary Clinton, and things only seem to be getting worse. She's panicking behind closed doors, and things are now spiraling out of control after a popular liberal newspaper attempted to brag about the presidential hopeful by using a picture of her in Florida. However, liberals were left furious when they realized what snuck in behind her in the photo. 
Hillary Clinton stopped at an early voting location to do a little last-minute campaigning in Pompano Beach, Florida. When The New York Times obtained a picture of Hillary at the event, they decided to run the picture in their newspaper. However, the editors made one massive mistake that left them not only furious but embarrassed as to what they had accidentally published behind Hillary in the picture 
According to The Gateway Pundit , 'You know the wheels are falling off your crooked campaign when the far left NY Times' publishes a picture of Hillary Clinton surrounded by Trump supporters. At least six Trump signs can be seen in the photo, making them hard to miss, but liberals have been known to turn a blind eye to obvious things, such as the dirty deeds of their crooked candidate. 
As Mad World News has previously reported, Hillary's problems only got worse when those Trump supporters were heard chanting three brutal words, 'Lock her up.' Of course, she chose to ignore their bold statement and focused on her few supporters who were in attendance and were mildly excited for her presence. 
Clearly, Hillary Clinton's campaign is imploding and her chances of being elected as the next president are getting smaller and smaller on a daily basis. Obviously, it's her own fault. 
Perhaps if she had learned how to be a bit more honest and a lot less corrupt, she wouldn't have anything to worry about from the FBI or the American voters. However, that's not the case for the crooked Clinton, and it's becoming a no-brainer that Donald Trump is going to be in the Oval Office, working to make America great again.

The Clinton Foundation and its foreign donors have been an area of concern should Hillary Clinton become president due to accusations of pay-to-play scandals. Knowing this, Hillary gave her word that the Clinton Foundation would stop accepting foreign donations should she be elected president. However, a new leak just exposed her real plan for foreign donors, and it's not looking good. Hillary Clinton 
Once again, Hillary has landed herself in the middle of more scandalous activity. With the FBI reopening her email and private server investigation and WikiLeaks continuously exposing her corruption, she can't seem to catch a break — and she shouldn't. Her long list of scandals continues to grow, as should her nose, after being busted lying to the American people yet again to manipulate her way into our White House. 
According to a leaked memo, Hillary's words mean nothing. Although she promised that the Clinton Foundation would cease accepting foreign donations if she were to be elected president, a leaked memo has exposed her real plans and proven that she didn't mean what she said. Two-faced Hillary told the public one thing, while her secret plan was for something much different. 
Thanks to WikiLeaks, the truth is again being revealed after the organization published an email that was sent to John Podesta, the Clinton Campaign chair. The email contained the leaked memo, which appears to have been crafted by Cheryl Mills, a Clinton aide, who wrote, 'I connected with HRC this am regarding the steps she will take with regard to the Foundation should she announce a decision to explore a run for the Presidency,' just days before Hillary announced her run for president. 
Although she's said otherwise throughout her campaign, Hillary's personal preference, as indicated by the leaked memo dated April 7, 2015, is for the foundation to continue accepting money from foreign governments, The Daily Caller reports, and this could mean bad news for Hillary as five FBI field offices are currently investigating her 'nonprofit' foundation due to pay-to-play allegations, although the Department of Justice did their best to suppress investigations into the corrupt Clinton Foundation. 
The leaked memo clearly shows that Hillary indicated to staffers that her personal preference is for the foundation to continue to accept money from foreign governments, even if she is elected president . What's worse, the corrupt Clintons were hesitant to limit the foundation's financial operations in any way, as the memo says, Hillary 'does not want to limit the Foundation's ability to operate programs now or in the future,' adding, ' we don't want to close the door to unexpected opportunities. ' 
The memo goes on to mention a 'compromise' option, where it says they could 'say that the Foundation will not accept contributions from foreign governments unless that funding is part of an ongoing program or a disbursement for a completed negotiation.' However, under that option, the foundation would continue to accept money from Qatar despite Hillary's own admission that the country is financially supporting ISIS . 
The 'final option' mentioned 'would mirror the 2008 [Memorandum of Understanding] agreement whereby the Foundation submits new foreign government contributions and those of a substantial size increase to an independent body (e.g. White House, State Department) for review. The obvious challenge with this is that there is no independent body to make that review.' However, as The Daily Caller notes, Hillary 'did not uphold her end of the 2008 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU),' and even liberal-leaning PolitiFact ruled the claim that Hillary acted in accordance with the 2008 MOU 'mostly false.' 
When is enough, enough? The Clinton crime family will never change their ways and their fake foundation is only a front for their shady deals. The Clintons' greed for money and power is endless and nothing — not even our laws — will stand in the way of Hillary and Bill as they grab as much of both as they can. There's only one place Hillary belongs while on this earth, and that's not the Oval Office, it's a cinderblock cell. After her time there is done, she has a one-way ticket to hell, where she probably hopes to overthrow the devil. That is how evil, corrupt, and power hungry she is. Her deceit and depravity know no bounds, and she would even give the devil a run for his money. Do you really want that kind of person to be our next president?

Obama and Justice Dept. Busted In Rigging Plot After Hillary Memo Leaks Posted on November 1, 2016 by Prissy Holly in Politics  
Over the weekend, many of us were left cheering over the news that the FBI was reopening their investigation into Hillary Clinton's private server. Unfortunately, our celebrating might be short lived. Democrats are already scheming with how to get her off with no charges, including Barack Obama and other top officials who were paramount in her walking away scot-free. 
It seems that no matter how crooked Hillary is, Democrats will always swarm together to protect their evil queen bee. The whole checks-and-balances thing among our branches of government is completely thrown out the window whenever Hillary is involved, as she simply buys the silence of government officials, or if that doesn't work, she kills them. It should come as no surprise that the very same people who helped her walk away from her Benghazi scandal, are now flocking once again to save her ass. 
We've all seen Obama's 'Justice' Department in action over the tenure of his presidency, and it's anything but contrived of justice. Now, we're seeing even more evidence of their twisted schemes in practice, proving again that everything in Washington, D.C. is completely rigged. 
In a letter to Congressional leaders, Obama's DOJ stated that when it comes to the investigation of over 650,000 emails on Anthony Weiner's home computer that they will 'work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible.' 
While that might sound great and wonderful on the surface, most people missed who signed that letter of compliance — Hillary's partner in crime, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik. The crooked man not only testified during Benghazi as to Hillary's 'innocence,' but he is also really good friends with Hillary's presidential campaign chair, John Podesta. Kadzik and Podesta hung out and dined to celebrate the day after Hillary's Benghazi hearings before Congress, and Kadzik was mentioned a whopping 20 times in Podesta's emails that were recently released by WikiLeaks. 
However, the conniving doesn't end there. Rumors are already swirling that if Hillary does get into trouble with this new investigation, that Obama is planning to pardon her, even if it's done retroactively after he leaves the White House. 
In a recent interview, Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Tx) said that win or lose, Barack Obama will simply pardon Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton. 'I think win or lose there's a presidential pardon in her future. Historical precedent was set when Ford retroactively pardoned Nixon. I don't think that's good for our country, but I'm afraid that's going to happen.' 
Even more infuriating, if Hillary is elected president, she could simply pardon herself. Presidential pardoning powers come from Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution that states that presidents 'have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.' Basically, as long as she's not being impeached, she could pardon herself and walk away completely free. 
Our Founding Fathers were so careful in how they worded our founding documents so that no one in government could ever become too powerful. But how do you plan for someone who encompasses the evil of Hillary Clinton, where she practically owns and controls every single person in Washington, D.C.? If this woman gets elected as the next president, we will soon have a lawless tyrant leading our country.

It's Over For Hillary After People See What She Snuck In Her Online Post Posted on November 1, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  Hillary Clinton 
Social media seems to be a tricky tool for Hillary Clinton, as she made a major mistake in what she shared online when she was either inebriated or hopped up on medication to treat what's been plaguing her throughout this election. Shocked viewers couldn't believe what was seen in her post, which she didn't catch until it was way too late. 
Although we've seen how good Hillary is at hitting the 'delete' button, she didn't get to it quick enough after what she mindlessly posted that proved what Americans have suspected. Evidently, she didn't realize she was making a point against herself when she made the comment with the post that said, 'A guide to help you make your choice for president,' which mad the mistake all the worse for her. 
Either Hillary takes full responsibility for being corrupt by apparently admitting to it, or the person that does her social media is paying a big price today. Without reading what she was sharing, Hillary blindly posted an article from the super liberal news site, Slate, assuming that if it was from them, it was pro-Hillary, when the title of the piece called her out for being one of the 'most corrupt, least popular candidates of all time.' A guide to help you make your choice for president. https://t.co/QzK7XZYmJW 
— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 31, 2016 
Urging her followers in the comment with the post to use it as a guide for making the best presidential pick, it was the best and most honest advice she's ever given. It's for this reason that the post was likely an accident since we all know that Hillary is incapable of being truthful, but karma, in this case, ensured she was. The irony of the situation isn't lost on conservatives but apparently was on Slate, whose piece was actually meant to promote the Democratic candidate but came across as just the opposite. 
The truth has a sneaky way of coming out as it did in this headline, which calls attention to this woman's lack of character and qualifications for the presidency. For once, there's finally some common ground conservatives have found within this liberal publication's pages, and that's that Hillary Clinton is corrupt and incapable of being a leader.

Hillary's DONE After Announcing Potential Cabinet Member, Try Not To Vomit Posted on November 1, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics  
With her numbers tanking, Hillary Clinton is desperate for any vote that she can get. Proving just that, she just floated an idea for a potential cabinet member, but it could actually end her once and for all. 
At this point, it's clear that Hillary isn't in control of her own campaign. If she was, she would have buried herself a long time ago. As we continue to get glimpses of her crooked behavior that she tries to keep behind the curtain, it doesn't take too much of a genius to know that she doesn't really have any good ideas of her own. Hillary Clinton 
Proving just that is a potential cabinet member she floated during an interview with Extra . As she didn't have her strategists whispering in her ear at the time, telling her when to shut up and when to speak, she actually stated that she would love to have Michelle Obama as a part of her team . 
Michelle Obama is a nobody outside of being married to a president. She's been nothing more than a freeloader for the past 8 years who has done literally nothing but make the lives of the American people a living hell. Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama 
Despite Michelle's failed legacies and lackadaisical tendencies, Hillary still thought that she would make a great addition to her team. Then again, both Hillary and Michelle have a taste for the finer things in life and enjoy the fruits of everyone else's labor. 
When directly asked if she would like Michelle in her cabinet, Hillary simply stated : 
'She's made it pretty clear she wants to focus on important issues like girls' education around the world – she and I actually talked about it when we were together in Winston-Salem – and I want to be the best partner I can be for whenever she wants to be involved in government again.' 
However, that wasn't quite the end of the thought process as she next went against what President Barack Obama said in that Michelle wasn't interested in the slightest when it came to furthering herself in the political realm. 'I think she wants to take a break from it, but if she ever wants to do anything like that, I would be the number-one person,' Hillary said. 'Well, I don't know how anybody could have done what she's done for the last eight years with more grace and more of a sense of purpose but inclusivity.' 
Hillary's sentiments become laughable when she hints to the idea that Michelle actually did anything. Think long and hard about what she did and you'll come up with nothing. Her lunch policy only left kids hungry and unsatisfied before failing overall when schools systematically began to reject her mandate. Michelle and Barack Obama 
Making sure girls are taught everywhere? Well, all we saw was Michelle flying around the globe and taking several vacations while demanding other countries change their ways. Beyond the fact that this does absolutely nothing for the American people (and actually hurts them on account of the cost associated with the several trips), it only ticked people off and made Americans look pretty stupid. 
Of course, this would be a 'smart' choice for Hillary seeing how blind leftists love and support Michelle for some reason. However, all it really equates to are a few more votes in her pocket as she panders to the audience of someone else. Basically, Hillary is trying to whore Michelle out. I wonder how she feels about that.

The FBI's recent announcement, that the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and private server has been reopened, made Huma Abedin a household name if it wasn't already. However, many missed the chilling video released by Anonymous, exposing Abedin just days before the FBI's announcement. It's one that the mainstream media didn't want you to see, but every American needs to watch it. 
After the laptop of Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, ended up in the hands of the FBI, Hillary's misdeeds came under scrutiny once again. With another scandal and more controversy hitting the Clinton campaign, many have begun talking not only about Hillary Clinton but her closest aide as well. However, emails, laptops, and perverted husband Anthony Weiner are the least of our worries when it comes to Huma Abedin. 
In a mission to inform Americans, an informative but bone-chilling video has been released by Anonymous, exposing the real Huma Abedin. Although Mad World News previously reported on her ties to radical Islam, the recently released video that's now begun to circulate on social media lays out her connections in an easy to follow visual that every American needs to see. 
'Who Is Huma?' the video asks, and the answer is chilling. The narrator of the video names four main players in exposing the truth behind Abedin and her disturbing ties to groups and people who fund terrorism. Those players are obviously Abedin herself and Hillary Clinton , but also Abdullah Omar Nasseef and Saudi Arabia, where Huma was raised from the age of two until she was 18. 
According to the video and verified by a lengthy piece in Vanity Fair , Huma worked for the Abedin family business, The Institute of Minority Muslim Affairs, which is a pro-Sharia Law newsletter 'owned by the Muslim World League, Saudi Arabia's global organization that promotes violent Wahhabi Islam,' BizPac Review reports. This family business was created by Abedin's father and Nasseef, one of the four main players identified in the clip, who is also one of the founders of the Muslim World League. 
With Huma being Hillary's closest aide, Huma's close ties to terrorism extend to Hillary Clinton, which is a frightening thought considering she could be our next president. What's worse, if Hillary is elected president, she would have Huma Abedin become Secretary of State, according to leaked emails between Hillary Clinton and her former chief of staff Cheryl Mills. 
While everyone is concentrating on what may or may not be in the emails discovered on the laptop of Abedin's perverse husband, this is the information everyone should see before voting. This woman, with undeniable ties to terrorists and 9/11 funders, has been Hillary's shadow and right-hand for decades, and that won't change if Hillary becomes president. In fact, it could only get worse. If you want to know the true measure of someone's character, look who they surround themselves with. The old saying, 'Birds of a feather flock together,' rings true, and these are two birds that should be in a cage, not our White House.

Hillary Thugs IDENTIFIED, Homeless Woman Protecting Trump Star Gets Justice Posted on November 1, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in News  
In a sad story that went viral, thugs beat up a homeless black woman who was defending Donald Trump's star on Hollywood Boulevard. Now, those thugs have been identified. Shockingly, these Hillary Clinton thugs are nothing but bullies who beat up anyone supporting Trump, even the elderly and disabled, but the good news is, the homeless black woman is getting much-deserved justice. A black homeless woman was beaten up by Hillary thugs for protecting Donald Trump's 'star'& supporting him in this election. 
After an idiot took a jackhammer to Donald Trump's Hollywood 'Star of Fame,' one brave black homeless woman decided to protect it from further damage. That brought out the Hillary bullies, but there was one problem. None of them could be identified because   kept the best video evidence from getting out. 
Now, Paul Joseph Watson of Infowars has obtained a clear copy of what happened, and we now have enough evidence to identify the attackers. In the video, Watson does an excellent job of identifying two of the Hillary bullies. One he calls ' Trigglypuff ,' an obese woman who may identify as a man, is wanted for felony assault by Los Angeles police, and another man, who ironically is wearing a cross necklace, taunted the homeless woman, saying, 'Didn't I tell you about five minutes ago that no I would not defend you because you spewed hate and you got hate, you got exactly what you were dishing out.' 'Trigglypuff' (the name given to social justice warriors who get triggered) is caught on video, wanted by police for felony assault. The thug who yelled, 'Didn't I tell you,' is caught on video and also wanted by Los Angeles police for aiding and abetting a felony assault. 
The California homeless woman sat on the star with a sign that read, '20 Million Illegals and Americans Sleep in the Streets In Tents, Vote For Trump.' That was the 'hate' she was spewing, and here is the backward logic the Hillary bullies are selling, as Watson sarcastically points out , 'Didn't I tell you if you disagree if you dare disagree with our retarded political opinions you get physically attacked by a sack of sh*t [Trigglypuff] and by the way it's your fault for spewing hate.' 
Another thug can be heard saying not to call an ambulance as they continue to laugh at the victim, but there is a silver lining. This latest video gives the police all they need to formally identify 'Trigglypuff,' who is wanted for felony assault and those other thugs who aided and abetted the felony crime of beating this homeless woman. 
This incident has gotten so much attention, and the police are very motivated to do everything they can to track down these Hillary bullies. It's just a matter of time, and they will be positively identified. In the meantime, Trump dispatched one of his representatives to Los Angeles to find the homeless woman to give her 'something.' I'm sure Trump was moved by this woman's plight, and what he is offering will help her in the dire situation she finds herself in. 
This story was not on any mainstream media networks, but imagine if the homeless woman was a Hillary supporter and Trump supporters beat her up. We all know it would be reported on 24/7 on CNN and MSNBC with panels of experts discussing Trump and his supporters who commit acts of violence. 
As Watson concludes in his video, the only thugs acting out after this election will be the paid Hillary bullies who time after time have shown up at Trump events and used violence against peaceful citizens. Luckily, their sick reign of shame and violence is coming to an end as Hillary is falling apart and Trump will be elected our next president.

A Hillary Clinton presidency would devastate our nation, damaging an already unstable economy as she destroys our Constitution and taxes Americans until they bleed. Several businesses are aware of this frightening reality, and they have decided to prepare themselves and others for the worst case scenario — a Hillary presidency. 
Small businesses are often those affected the most by a Democrat's economic policy, but many of America's 'mom and pop' shops are determined to overcome should this terrifying possibility become our reality. Surprisingly, there is a silver lining for some. Certain businesses actually realize that a vote for Hillary and her election as our next president will likely make them extremely wealthy — if only temporarily. Democrat presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton 
Gun stores everywhere plan to stock up on guns in preparation for the rigged election, in which most think Hillary has already been decided the winner. Although some are driven by the desire to protect their families, many gun owners are stocking up now before Hillary has a chance to try to take their rights away, which she has vowed to do. Those who have shopped in gun stores even tell the owners that they are gearing up for a Hillary presidency. 
Two things drive up sales like no ads on TV ever could. The first is election campaigns, which inevitably pit gun-rights advocates against those asking for stricter gun-control laws. And the second, are tragedies in the news, especially mass shootings. Jared Fulton and his son Dave at their gun store, Freedom Firearms 
'If Hillary Clinton gets elected it's going to be all hands on deck, and its going to be a crazy day,' says Jared Fulton, who founded Freedom Firearms with his brother, Joel, in 2002, shortly after Michigan passed a new 'concealed-carry' law allowing any adult to carry weapons on their person as long as they're out of sight. 'It's going to be several crazy days, in fact.' [via Independent ] 
While Democrats cry and complain about guns, their antics actually push sales and drive the number of guns in civilian hands exponentially higher. This was seen the day after Barack Obama's election and the day of his inauguration. Instead of watching him take the presidential oath, many Second Amendment supporters went out and purchased guns that they knew would offend the new president. And, it won't be different if Hillary is elected. 
Make no mistake that while Obama currently holds the record for 'gun salesman of the year,' every year since he was elected, Hillary will surpass him. Having firepower to back your decision not to consent to her corrupt presidency may be key as she tries to start World War III. Not all Americans are going to willingly accept Hillary's rigged and invalid authority. When tyrannical leaders try to take our country from We the People , it's our duty to remind them why our Founding Fathers gave us the Second Amendment.

Investigators Horrified At What Was Left Behind In Hillary's Hotel Room Posted on November 1, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics  Hillary Clinton (left), Huma Abedin with Hillary (right) 
Having gotten away with so much for so long, Hillary Clinton and her inner circle became careless in covering their trail, perhaps because they were confident about not getting caught. However, that's all coming back to haunt them as investigators uncovered what Hillary left behind in her hotel room which should disqualify her from the presidential race. 
Since the start of the re-investigation into Hillary's emails and supposedly disappearing server, a slew of secrets have trickled out that leaves one to wonder how they were missed in the first place. It's recently been discovered what was found in her hotel room on a 2010 trip to Beijing, China, and it could result in dire consequences for our country. 
Fox News reported that when then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton traveled to the orient with an unnamed 'senior aide' six years ago, they brought classified information with them. As prior investigations into her e-mails have proved, tipsy Hillary has a hard time keeping track of highly sensitive documents, and these in China were apparently no different. The unidentified aide, whose job it is to manage these things, left the information unsecured in the hotel room. 
'In May 2010, Secretary Clinton was on official travel in Beijing, China, accompanied by senior staff. Upon Secretary Clinton's departure, a routine security sweep by Diplomatic Security agents identified classified documents in a staff member's suite,' State Department spokesman John Kirby told Fox News in a statement. 
Confirmation of this mishandling comes out now as Hillary herself and her longtime senior aide, Huma Abedin, are being investigated for mishandling of sensitive information on a private server that she wasn't supposed to have. Although it's a matter of national security, Clinton and her crack squad can't seem to be trusted with anything of importance that puts our nation in jeopardy. 
For this reason, Hillary Clinton shouldn't even be considered for the White House where she would have full access to nuclear codes. Ironically, she said Donald Trump couldn't be trusted with these, yet he's not the one with thousands of 'lost' emails and classified documents left in a hotel room overseas.
