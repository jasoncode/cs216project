Why does everyone think that presidential campaigns are about 'issues,' when anyone over the age of consent knows they are all about sex? But it says a lot about the lasting power of Viagra that this is still the case when we have a couple of seventy-year-olds on the ballot. (' For an election lasting more than four years, please call your doctor .') 
In last week's newspaper there was a report on the tenth or eleventh woman (I have lost track) to come forward to say that Donald Trump made suggestive and 'inappropriate' advances to her during a golf tournament that took place about ten years ago. 
The woman in question is Jessica Drake, who during her press conference announced that at the time of the tournament, she was working in the 'the adult industry' (that's what People Magazine calls porn) for Wicked Pictures (the 20th Century Fox of gang banging) when the randy Donald kissed and hugged her in his room. 
Trump was already in his pajamas when she knocked on his door, together with two friends. Normally, in the adult business, when three porn stars knock on your hotel door, it's considered foreplay. 
When Trump's effusive greeting of Miss Drake did not lead to more snuggling, let alone the suggestion to preview some of her work on the hotel television, he offered her $10,000 to satisfy his suite dreams. 
Drake again demurred, saying that the next morning she needed to get back to Los Angeles 'for work.' By that point in her career she had already notched screen credits for 'Extreme Doggie' and 'Fornocopia.' I would mention other titles, but as they say at the New York Post , 'This is a family newspaper.' 
That rejection prompted Donald to offer Jessica an early morning ride (of shame?) on his Trump airliner back to LA, which still didn't turn the trick. * * * 
Then last week, in the presence of her lawyer, Gloria Allred (the Perry Mason of many cases against Bill Cosby) Miss Drake tearfully repeated in primetime her shock and dismay that Mr. Trump had tried to take liberties with her reputation, which, after all, includes the 2009 Adult Video News Award for the 'Best Double Penetration Sex Scene' in her classic work, 'Fallen.' 
Drake said she was coming forward now to stand in 'solidarity' with the other women Trump has manhandled, although there were suggestions that her outing was timed to coincide with the launch of Drake's new online store, where devoted viewers can purchase such classics as her 'Guide to BDSM for Beginners,' among other titles. 
Normally scenes such as the one I am describing would be consigned to John Oliver, Monty Python, or Saturday Night Live , but in the new normal of presidential politics, even Miss Drake gets a respectful hearing on the issues. 
For example, the next day the Huffington Post reported: 'Woman Says Trump Sexually Assaulted Her, Offered Her $10,000 For Sex.' 
The deadpan New York Times wrote: 'Ms. Drake, who appeared Saturday with the women's rights lawyer Gloria Allred, said Mr. Trump had hugged and kissed her and the other women without permission.' 
The headline in New York Magazine read: 'Adult Actress Jessica Drake Details Trump Assault, Blasts Him for 'Uncontrollable Misogyny'.' 
Look, I have no doubt that Trump is a pig who routinely gropes and propositions women, but since when does the press in a presidential election have to source its stories in the 'adult' industry? * * * 
Sadly, the answer to this question dates to winter 1992 when Bill and Hillary Clinton figured out that unless a presidential candidate has a sexual storyline, few of the voters will pay much attention to their positions on nuclear disarmament or welfare reform. 
During the 1992 Super Bowl, the Clintons appeared on a halftime special of 60 Minutes to deny jointly (Bill: That allegation is false ) that he had ever had an affair with Gennifer Flowers, who lived in Little Rock, Arkansas when Bill was governor and often out jogging. 
In this vaudeville performance, Hillary played the straight man, adding: 'You know, I'm not sitting here'îsome little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.' (At least she didn't reference The Eagles.) 
Only in 1998, under oath in a sworn deposition, did Bill admit to having a 12-year affair with Ms. Flowers. But neither her allegations in 1992, nor his lying about it, cost him the election that year. 
Just the opposite: Clinton's wanderlust might have won him sympathy among the voters (no strangers to sexual boredom) who found they had more in common with a soft-shell Baptist (Bill) than an uptight Protestant (George H.W. Bush). 
Nor did Clinton's impeachment in 1998 for lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky under oath in the Paula Jones case hurt his post-presidential career (worth $200 million +) or the electoral prospects of his wife in 2016. 
But it did turn sexuality into a mainstream presidential campaign issue, which is one of the reasons why this year's race seems only to be about sex. * * * 
No doubt the Clintons do find some delicious irony in Trump's groping charges, as payback for what they view as the Republican use of sexuality to impeach Bill in 1998 and, in 2016, for the GOP plan to make his many adulterous affairs fair game for their campaign soundbites. (Cut to an online image of the White House and over it a fading picture of Bill smoking a cigar, with the caption 'Here we go again?') 
Without the pageant-loving, casino operating Donald Trump as the Republican nominee in 2016, Hillary Clinton could well have been vulnerable on the sexual front, with Bill's mistresses steady fodder for negatives ads and the many allegations from his scorned lovers that Hillary organized the slut-shaming. 
Instead of the 2016 election turning on Hillary's marriage to Hugh Hefner's doppelg√§nger, the storyline that has played best in the media is Donald's secret life as a groper. 
The press actually has given Trump a pass for his adultery (which produced all those wonderful children) but zeroed in on his groping, in part because he confessed to it on an NBC videotape and also because'îthink of ratings'îgropers belong in the same basket of deplorables as child abusers and others lurking on subways, crowed elevators, or near schoolyards. 
Best of all for the Clintons, politically anyway, is that the charge of groping is impossible for Trump to refute. Even denying it sounds sleazy. 
And it colors all aspects of the campaign. To wit: the New York Times headline when at Gettysburg Trump outlined his vision for America: 'Donald Trump Pledges to 'Heal Divisions' (and Sue His Accusers).' * * * 
For its mud-slinging, I am sure the Trump campaign has spent many long hours brainstorming how to tar Hillary as a lesbian. But even that innuendo has fallen flat, despite the rumor mongering that she's in a Boston marriage with her assistant Huma Abedin (whose husband, Anthony Weiner, is otherwise distracted in high school chat rooms). 
Several of Bill's former lovers (Sally Miller, Dolly Kyle, and Flowers) have tried to play up Bill's pillow talk that Hillary prefers the nighttime company of women. But none of these allegations have gone further than Infowars or the supermarket press. (' Hillary Hit Man Tells All !') 
Nor have out-of-wedlock children, a staple of the 1884 campaign (as was chanted to Grover Cleveland: ' Ma, Ma, Where ' s my pa ?'), gotten much play in this year's presidential race. 
Trump and his casino gumshoes have put considerable effort into tracking down the rumor that Danney Williams is Bill Clinton's illegitimate son by a Little Rock prostitute named Bobbie Ann Williams. 
Trump invited Danney (a sympathetic man) to the third presidential debate, as if to press on Bill a Scarlet Letter. Despite Williams looking very much like President Bill, the story got no more traction than did the news that Malik Obama, the president's shunned half-brother, is supporting Trump. He, too, got a debate invitation, to sit in the box presumably marked 'Shame.' 
Also in the dustbin of history are the allegations that Flowers aborted Bill's baby in 1977 and the whispering campaign (a great political standby when proof is elusive) that Chelsea is the product of an affair between Hillary and her then law firm colleague, Webb Hubbell. 
The Williams and Hubbell stories come with some convincing Internet similarities, at least in the photographs, although in both cases politically, this rumor milling whiplashed against Trump, as voters have only equated such tawdry allegations with his Birther past, something that has stuck as campaign mud. * * * 
Technically, Birtherism does't directly involve sex, although it lingers on its fringes, as it speaks to Barack Obama's illegitimacy, his foreign allegiances, and possibly disputed paternity, including the claim that Frank Marshall Davis was actually Obama's biological father (another subterranean creed of Trumpism). 
Again, the documentary proof is a series of look-a-like photographs, as close as the Internet gets to DNA. That Davis was an American Communist works well in the campaign, as it suggests the origins of Obama's political genetic code. 
Ironically, for all his efforts at smear, Trump came out the loser in the debates when Hillary nailed him to Birtherism, which has become a convenient code word for Trump's racism, misogyny, and intolerance of immigrants, especially muslims. 
Nor, in response, did Trump have any luck in linking the Birther movement to Clinton's 2008 campaign, when, according to Donald, consigliere-journalist Sidney Blumenthal delighted in the suggestion that Barack was born in Kenya. 
Instead, the debate claim only made Trump look disingenuous. Clinton got a pass on what her campaign may or may not have insinuated in 2008. And at this point, no one cares. But voters do remember Trump as the Imperial Wizard of Birtherism. * * * 
Republicans can only blame themselves for wanting to divide the electorate in 2016 along lines of sexual preference or deviance, although this strategy was based on Hillary being the Democratic nominee and anyone other than Trump standing for the Republicans. 
Had the GOP nominee been Carly Fiorina, Jeb Bush, or John Kasich, Clinton Inc. might well have been vulnerable to possible storylines about infidelity, illegitimacy, and rape. (Cue up the Paula Jones description of Bill, during a business meeting, exposing himself in a Little Rock hotel and settling her lawsuit for $850,000.) 
Instead, the Republicans went with the polyamorous Trump, who, in addition to three marriages, has bragged on morning radio about his success with young women and who since 1996 has been leering at Miss Universe contestants'îa bit like Austin Powers. ( Shall we shag now, or shall we shag later ?) 
With Trump's resum√© of creepy perversion, you might have thought that the Republicans would drop sexual misconduct from the electoral playbook. Instead, they doubled down to make the case that both Clintons, if elected, would turn the White House into a strip club. 
Not only did the Clintons shrug off such innuendo, but, in response, they said (in effect), if they did, it would be to cater to the likes of players such as Donald J. Trump (leisure suit and open collar optional). * * * 
For the moment'îand I can't see anything changing in the last days of the campaign'îthe accepted wisdom of most front pages is that Donald Trump has groped as many women as Tiger Woods has watched pole dancing in Vegas. Even the gallery of 'their women' looks about the same. 
Conversely, few voters seem to care that Bill might have forced himself on several women or that Hillary helped to cover up his brutality. That's a narrative of the 1990s, which is perhaps the last time Austin Danger Trump read the newspaper. ( I've been frozen for 30 years. I've got to see if my bits and pieces are still working .) 
For most voters in 2016, names such as Kathleen Willey or Juanita Broaddrick are as lost in time as Nan Britton, who just before the 1920 election bore a love child with then candidate Senator Warren Harding. 
Britton and the child got Republican hush money and a sad little house in Asbury Park, New Jersey. After Harding won, she was invited to the White House but their affair, so to speak, was kept in the closet. * * * 
If you think about elections as political sitcoms, in 1960 the Kennedys had to run as Rob and Laura Petrie on The Dick Van Dyke Show , complete with twin beds, long flannel pajamas, and prudent kisses on the cheek to say good-night, even if The JFK Reality Show would make Trump, Bill Clinton, and Tiger look like apprentices at adultery. 
Come 2016, only something that resembles Modern Family and a desperate-housewives reality show can crack network primetime, and who better to put on air than The Clintons, with their Dallas -like money, communal sexuality, and more illicit storylines than CSI . 
For more than twenty years, Bill and Hillary have been bringing us seasons of lust, affairs, 'I-did-not-have-sex-with-that-woman', Vince Foster, Travelgate, foundation slush funds, basement servers, commodity trading, Whitewater, Bosnian snipers, pay-to-play, Benghazi, lost e-mails, and the like, and the ratings only continue to go up. 
Sure, The Apprentice was fun for a few episodes, but the sameness of insulting young people grew tedious. How is that supposed to compete with Bill making a pass at Huma, while her husband goes to prison for airing his junk, and Chelsea finding out about her real father. Next on The Clintons ?

This fall, the U.S. agreed to provide $38 billion in military aid to Israel over the next ten years, ensuring America's continued role in funding the occupation of Palestine. Meanwhile, my friends and colleagues here in Gaza live in fear of another significant Israeli attack in the near future. 
They have every reason to fear another major escalation 'î violence is a daily reality in Gaza. In two recent incidents, a rocket was fired from Gaza into Israel without causing damage or injuries, and in both instances Israel responded by bombing targets throughout Gaza. 
In August alone, Israel bombed more than 50 locations in the small territory . 
The simple story told about these events focuses on action and reaction: Palestinians attacked Israel with a rocket and Israel responded. We hear this logic after nearly every event of this sort, but it's woefully incomplete. 
In both instances, the rockets fired weren't fired by Hamas, but rather by small radical armed groups at odds with Hamas, which governs Gaza. These groups seek to incite Israeli attacks on Hamas with the goal of destabilizing its control over Gaza, because they see Hamas as too comfortable with the status quo. 
Since seizing power in 2007, Hamas has worked to control and limit violence from the territory. Outside of periods of defined military escalation 'î which tend to be precipitated by Israeli attacks 'î they have effectively stopped attacks against Israel from Gaza. 
This explains why, as noted by the Israeli press, there were only 14 rockets fired from Gaza towards Israel between January and August this year. None were fired by Hamas, so Israel's decision to target Hamas as a response makes no sense. 
Of course, 14 rockets fired from Gaza is 14 too many for those of us committed to ending all violence, and none of this should be taken as an apology for other violence perpetrated by Hamas. 
But, as the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories reports , there were also 45 Israeli military incursions into Gaza this year, resulting in 7 Palestinian deaths and, on average, injuring five Palestinians in Gaza every week. 
This is the part of the story that isn't told. 
Gaza also remains under an Israeli-imposed blockade that severely limits travel, trade, and life for Gazans. Despite assurances that restrictions would be lifted in the 2014 Hamas-Israel ceasefire agreement, the blockade remains in effect. 
Israel, with support from the U.S. government, claims this decades-long blockade is in place to pressure the people of Gaza to rise up against Hamas and provide security for Israelis. 
If those are Israel's raisons d'etre, then it's a complete failure. It hasn't stopped violence, it hasn't weakened Hamas, and it hasn't brought Israelis or Palestinians security. 
While the blockade hasn't succeeded in achieving the changes Israel claims to be seeking, its impact on the civilian population of Gaza has been immense. 
Over two years after the end of the last large military operation there, much of Gaza remains in ruins. 
Of the 100,000 Palestinians in Gaza who were displaced during the 2014 Israeli bombardment, over 65,000 remain homeless, as 70 percent of the homes seriously damaged or destroyed haven't been rebuilt. This is largely because reconstruction materials remain blocked from entering Gaza. 
This important context is too often missing as U.S. pundits and politicians consider the situation in Gaza. 
Given the blockade and regular military incursions imposed by Israel, the firing of less than 2 rockets per month by Palestinians cannot be seen as the core reason for violence. 
If the U.S. is serious about promoting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, preventing future violence in Gaza, and guaranteeing security, then it must recognize the violence inherent in the Israeli occupation and end the blockade. 
The next attack on Gaza, feared by my friends who live there, is an inevitable reality if nothing changes. 
Mike Merryman-Lotze has worked with the American Friends Service Committee as the Palestine-Israel Program Director since 2010.

It was fifty-four years or so when a classmate at Bard College insisted that I read a short story by Isaac Babel titled 'The Reserve Cavalry Commander' that he described to me as a Cossack soldier miraculously bringing a moribund horse to its feet. The Red Cavalry (the title of Babel's collection of short stories written when the Jew and former Menshevik was imbedded with pro-revolution Cossacks) had been confiscating peasant horses during the Civil War and trading in nags ridden to exhaustion on the battlefield for fresh ones. 
For the backward peasants, this was the sort of intrusion that would become the straw that broke the camel's back. In about a decade, being forced into collective farms like recalcitrant horses drove them into open revolt. For the time being, however, they were inclined to tolerate the Communists who at least had come to power on the promise of peace, bread and land. It was the assault on the gentry's land that for the time being assuaged the peasants. 
Responding to an aggrieved muzhik (peasant), Dyakov, the eponymous Reserve Cavalry Commander who was a former circus rider described by Babel as 'red-faced with a gray mustache, a black cape, and wide red Tatar trousers with silver stripes', promised that he could make this 'lively little mare spring to her feet again'. The idea that the horse splayed out on the ground could be described as 'lively' was almost an insult. The muzhik cried out, 'Lord in Heaven and Mother of God. How is this poor thing supposed to get up? It's on its last legs!': 
Dyakov's ability to bring the horse back on its feet was like Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead but all the more miraculous since it likely occurred. Most of Babel's short stories were based on his experience as a war correspondent. He wrote: 
'You are insulting this horse, my dear fellow!' Dyakov answered with fierce conviction. 'Pure blasphemy, my dear fellow!' And he deftly swung his athlete's body out of his saddle. Splendid and deft as if in the circus ring, he stretched his magnificent legs, his trousers girded by cords around the knees, and walked up to the dying animal. She peered at him dolefully with a severe, penetrating eye, licked some invisible command from his crimson palm, and immediately the feeble mare felt bracing power flow from this sprightly, gray, blossoming Romeo. Her muzzle lolling, her legs skidding under her, feeling the whip tickling her stomach with imperious impatience, the mare slowly and deliberate1y rose onto her legs. And then we all saw Dyakov's slender hand with its fluttering sleeve run through her dirty mane, and his whining whip swatting her bleeding ranks. Her whole body shivering, the mare stood on four legs without moving her timid, doglike, lovestruck eyes from Dyakov. 
'So you see-this is a horse,' Dyakov said to the muzhik , and added softly, 'and you were complaining, my dearest of friends!' 
Throwing his reins to his orderly, the commander of the Reserve Cavalry jumped the four stairs in a single leap and, swirling off his operatic cloak, disappeared into the headquarters. 
Today, reading this story once again for the first time in fifty-four years, I am reminded of how important Babel was to me at the time. Like Ezra Pound, James Joyce and Thomas Mann, he was a portal into the world of modernist literature that still had an immense attraction for young bohemians in the early 60s. I never thought once about who Babel was or anything about the social reality he was trying to depict. All that mattered to me was Babel's prose that could evoke the mysterious power of a Cossack resurrecting a dying horse. 
My early connections to modernism and my later connections to Marxism that superseded it and just about all the other intellectual baggage I carried around with me from the early 60s converged as I watched a press screening of 'Finding Babel' that opens on October 28 th at the Cinema Village in New York. Directed by David Novack, who has a background as a sound engineer, it is a film that will be of great interest to those whose appreciation of Babel is strictly literary as was mine long ago and to those trying to come to terms with the Soviet legacy. Given the prominence of Ukraine today as a possible trigger of WWIII according to some, Babel's multiple identity as Jew, Ukrainian, Communist and critic of Soviet deficiencies is worth pondering. 
The film is structured around the odyssey conducted by Andrei Malaev-Babel, who is the grandson of Isaac Babel and an acting professor in the theater department of the New College of Florida, to see where his grandfather lived and to speak with people who knew him or who have studied or been inspired by his work. Isaac Babel was executed for treason in 1940, having been charged with belonging to a Trotskyist group and spying for France and Austria. Babel's wife Antonina Pirozhkova, who died at the age of 101 in 2010, is interviewed in the film and provides much of the information about Babel's personality and his travails as a dissident. After her husband's arrest in 1939, the Soviet cops told her to forget about him and to 'regulate her life' according to the New York Times obituary. She was formidable in her own right. With her engineering degree, she helped to design the Moscow subway system. The obit notes: 
Ms. Pirozhkova recalled Babel's dismay at her haphazard reading habits, which he tried to correct by drawing up a list of the 'hundred books that every educated person needs to read.' It included a volume titled 'The Instincts and Morals of Insects.' She recounted evenings spent with Soviet cultural giants like the film director Sergei M. Eisenstein and visits by foreign luminaries like Andr√© Gide and Andr√© Malraux. 
It was Babel's mistake apparently to adhere to the values of the original Russian revolution rather than to fall in line as a Stalin toady. 
As he travels around Ukraine, Malaev-Babel encounters intellectuals and ordinary people who revere Babel as one of their own especially for 'Odessa Tales', another collection of short stories that is as highly regarded as 'Red Cavalry'. Written in 1923 and 1924, the stories focus on Jewish gangsters living in Moldavanka, an Odessa slum, hardly the material you'd expect to find written by a partisan of the Russian Revolution but certainly in keeping with the original inspiration of Soviet culture that conformed to Terence's observation: ' Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto ', or 'I am human, and nothing of that which is human is alien to me.' 
Although I have never read 'Odessa Tales', I plan to as soon as I find the time since it is about the same sort of characters my grandfather Louis Proyect probably knew in Byelorussia and who like him escaped pogroms by emigrating to the USA. Unlike my grandfather who made a life out of building hotels in Sullivan County in upstate NY, Abe 'Kid Twist' Reles and other members of Murder Incorporated only saw the Borscht Belt as a place where they could dump their victims in Swan Lake, about fifteen minutes from my home town. 
Throughout the film we hear brief excerpts from both collections narrated by Liev Schreiber that will be a good introduction to Babel's literary power. There are also interviews with some leading Babel scholars including Stanford professor Gregory Freidin who spent a day traveling around Paris with Malaev-Babel to see places where Babel lived for a few years before returning to Russia. We learn that although he could have avoided becoming one of Stalin's countless victims by living in exile, he was too attached to Russian culture and language to live abroad. 
While in Paris, Babel wrote a play titled 'Maria' that likely put him on Stalin's shit-list although being a free-thinking intellectual and artist might have condemned from the start. With his theater background, Malaev-Babel is ideally suited to discuss the play with fellow thespians including Marina Vlady, an acclaimed Russian-French actress, who reads a letter from the titular character. 
In 2003, Gregory Freidin mounted a production of 'Maria' at Stanford University. The play's program describes major character Isaac Dymshit, a Jewish gangster, as a symbol of capitalist rationality while the eponymous Maria epitomized the pure romance of the revolution. She, like the young Babel, served in the Red Cavalry. 
Never seen on stage, we only hear from Maria indirectly as her letter is recited by another character in scene five. It begins: 
At dawn the bugle from squadron headquarters wakes me. By eight I have to be in the Political Propaganda Division, I'm in charge there‚ÄìI edit the articles of the divisional newspaper, I run the literacy classes. Our reinforcements are all Ukrainians. They remind me of Italians, the way they talk and act. Russia has been suppressing and destroying their culture for centuries. In our house in Petersburg, opposite the Hermitage and the Winter Palace, we might as well have been living in Polynesia for we knew any¬≠ thing at all about our people! 
It is writing lines like this that got Babel killed rather than spying for France or Austria. 
Babel was a friend and prot√©g√© of Maxim Gorky, who remained a diehard Stalinist despite sharing Babel's inclination for writing about the lower depths of Russian society. He was deeply troubled by how 'Maria' depicted political corruption, prosecution of the innocent, and black marketeering within Soviet society. Gorky accused Babel of having a 'Baudelairean predilection for rotting meat.' Apparently Gorky had forgotten that Baudelaire was Marx's favorite novelist. 
David Novack, the director of 'Finding Babel' has a connection to Odessa but not to its legendary Jewish gangsters. He has an ancestor named David Nowakowsky who wrote liturgical music for a synagogue there. 
In an interview given to The Odessa Review , Novack sums up Isaac Babel's relationship to the Soviet experience that resonates with my own on the left. As someone with roots in the existential 'outsider' world of the 1960s that saw Albert Camus as its most eloquent spokesmen, I never found myself comfortable with the Trotskyist milieu that fostered cultish obedience to the Genius Leader. To this day, it has been these youthful affinities with outsider culture that makes it difficult for me to join any amen chorus on the left even though it is the left that remains my homeland. I think that Novack's description of Babel's 'insider/outsider' sensibility can help me preserve my sanity in a period of deep contradictions within the left: 
Babel represented the insider outsider, that's what he was. He got himself all the way inside, up to the upper levels of the NKVD. Up to Beria who ended up supervising his torture in the end, personally. I don't know if he was in the room, but he had an office in the St. Catharine's Monastery where Babel was tortured. That monastery was being used as a torture prison, the Sukhanovo prison, which we note in the film, we visited it. He got himself as close to the flame as possible as an insider, but yet he was an outsider because he was from Odessa, he was Jewish. He should not even have been permitted to study under Gorky which is where he really honed his skills. The only reason that he was able to study under Gorky is that he smuggled himself illegally to St. Petersburg when he wasn't allowed to be there, because it was outside the settlement area for Jews. So Babel was an outsider. He then found himself with Red Calvary with the Cossacks in the Red Army, running through Western Ukraine as he documented brutality against the Ukrainians and the Jews. Brutality brought on by both sides, it was a civil war essentially between the reds and the Poles. Who suffered the most? The Jews and the Ukrainians, the peasantry are the ones who suffered the most in that conflict. There he was again, the outsider insider. It's from this very unique perspective where all his writing came from.

The Death of the Secret is a crime that no one really wants to solve. Perhaps the same perp killed the Author, that shady fraud who once crept around the title pages of books taking on different names with the ease of an expert forger. Like The Pentagon Papers and WikiLeaks, our truly hidden books are written collectively, and the enemy knows full well that the appalling evidence is always the labor of unskilled workers on both sides. Recent investigation has determined that the murder of all secrets was either suicide or an Orient Express -type board decision. And the witnesses? Only a fool would believe a historian, a grand vizier, or an alchemist. 
Secrets may die but the society of secrets is immortal. The profound image of the Russian Doll haunts candidates, bureaus, corporations and nationalist blood orders. The venerable Rosy Crucians, who opened their first stateside office in Los Angeles, apparently date back to the Enlightenment and have lent a clandestine hand in distributing the film of history ever since. A new version of one of this shadowy brotherhood's foundational texts, The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz , attributed to mysterious Lutheran prelate Johann Valentin Andreae and first published in Germany in 1616, will be unveiled to the masses this November. 
John Crowley has consulted several older English versions, as well as living German advisors (Rosicrucian adepts?), and has come up with an utterly unpretentious working of this weird old parable which reads like a late-night barroom colloquy. The action materializes in static allegorical scenes on a one-dimensional plateau, as if the religious art of the Middle Ages, quite archaic by the 1600s, had sprang to life in movable type. The secrets of the Chemical Wedding appear in number, fantastic animals, columns with engraved ciphers, extraordinary machines and crystal observatories, by the technology of communiqu√© and dream. Every repetition seems to hide a vast chart of correspondences. Every character is a symbol on its way to resurrection. Every tale has ending which does not quite make sense. This meddle is admirably depicted in Theo Fadel's lovely line drawings which accompany the text. Crowley's giddy English gives it all an exciting unheimliche tension, contra the silly half-assed lingua occulta adopted by most grimoire peddlers. 
Christian Rosenkreutz (Rosy Cross) is invited to a wedding which he had seen earlier in a dream. A chance event leads him to take one of four paths (one for each element) to a great castle where he is met by a hall of absurd poltroons who stand for the various crackpot sciences of the day. This allows Andreae to take the piss out of disciplines such as alchemy and astrology while hinting that he knows their true meaning. Christian undergoes a series of odd interrogations and initiations, listens to stories bitten from Boccaccio, and is shown all kinds of occult symbolic phenomena. I leave out the resolution, but it involves a complex of fugitive pages, detective intuition and lively Borgesian games on the part of commentators famous and infamous. 
It is hard to escape the feeling that we are reading of the last gasps of Spengler's Magian world here. Its ancestors are Avicenna's Hayy ibn Yaqzan , 'Attar's Conference of Birds and other pearls of Islamic wisdom. Thus, the allegorical journey has an atmosphere of multiple buzzing heresies: Muslim, Freethinking, Deist. While Crowley rightly compares reading it today to Max Ernst's collage-novels, it is closer to a Mughal miniature in form. Une semaine de bont√© works against the received order of time and valorizes thievery and dislocation; The Chemical Wedding has the feeling of living for only an instant and it has quite different things to prove than homelessness. 
The story also seems Utopian. Andreae himself was involved in a number of outr√© scholastic projects (one of which counted Kepler as a student), and he is deliberately obscure about whether his political vision is Digger Proto-socialist or Platonic Monarchist. Such confusion has lasted down to present-day cabal theory, where secret societies are thought to be simultaneously communist and elitist. During the Nazi Occupation in France, someone plastered the walls and mailed out threats supposedly from a shadowy tendency called Synarchism. The texts were so confusing and contradictory that the fascists were unable to determine the guilty party: Was it the Left resistance, the Allies' propaganda arm, Freemasons, or some ultra-secret program of their own superiors? Synarchy never existed and was probably the work of a Claude Cahun-type partisan operating on her own in a basement. Anyway, it certainly came to be as a supply and demand mechanism of the Occupation's pathological reaction. 
Part of the strangeness in reading The Chemical Wedding is that we start to suspect all manner of intelligences working on its behalf 'ì the spirit of the author (somewhat disputed), the spirit of the time it was written, and the spirit of the gulf that separates us from that world. It is impossible to grasp the innocence of the forest of symbols because they now conceal new, unintended things made just for us and possibly of our own making. An allegory uprooted from its time can only return later as a new and beguiling mobile. Interpretation, which has rendered the old readings obsolete, is left with highly odd symbolic shells which take on contemporary gravity like moss to an old barge, a groaning relic of phantom weight hanging in the readers' mind. You 'ì or rather I and Thou'î are continually haunted by the idea that this little goblin book can say nothing at all to us, that it is truly inscrutable because its alchemic fable is so transparent. The initiatory 'plot' and rigid statuesque scenes no longer conceal any depth; it is actually hard to believe they ever did, which lends weight to the theory that the book was starkest parody. Behind the allegory there seems only an endless impenetrable black screen like the reverse of a common household mirror, a terror that we are constantly told is uniquely modern. But this is just the sort of fear than a magician who sees everything as it is not, meaning as it truly is , could never have possessed. 
Perhaps once such a forbidden book lead outward to a world where hidden forms lurked behind both sculpture and birch. But the maze and the minotaur have undergone an unsubtle transformation over the centuries. Now this same initiatory process leads to a strange counterfeit inwardness of fetish-objects and the productions of an arctic medium between outposts of information. The answer as to why the lion has devoured the sun can no longer be found in the Great Work which dazzled Christian Rosenkreutz with its semblances, but in the phantasmagoria which cheaply hides the House of Pain in Derivatives and other djinn of the financial world. The sweatshop is the present initiatory garden and it leads to dark value prized from the Global South. Wasn't the quest for knowledge always told as a journey to the East? Now rigged in tinsel of the poor allegory, a repetitive stain of bloody hands.

It's the perfect time to be an affluent white and politically correct North Side Lakefront 'ì or other kind of 'ì Liberal and sports fan in the Chicago area. Think about it. Your beloved Chicago Cubs are finally going to their first World Series since 1945 and they will be doing a battle against a team with the worst racist Native American logo in major U.S. professional sports: the Cleveland Indians 'ì yes, the 'Indians.' The Indians' Chief Wahoo 'ì a wild grinning caricature 'ì is the single most offensive, politically incorrect image in sports today. 
It's enough to make folks forget that the Cubs are owned by a politically active right-wing Republican family, the Ricketts, one of whom recently contributed $1 million to the racist and sexist bigot Donald Trump. And that the Cubs' storied ballpark Wrigley Field will be jammed with rich white people who can swallow up secondary market World Series tickets selling for as high as $18,000 . And that the Cubs owe no small part their ability to overcome their ' Billy Goat curse ' (proclaiming that they'd never go again to the final championship series) largely to massive infusions of big Ricketts money required to purchase free-agent veterans to go along with their younger stars. 
Meanwhile, the liberals' party has a presidential candidate Hillary Clinton who is about to become the national government's first female chief executive after trouncing the aforementioned bigot Trump in the November 8 th election. The insane, politically incorrect spectacle of Trump has helped people forget that Mrs. Clinton is herself a 'right-wing fanatic' and a 'lying neoliberal warmonger' 'ì and here I am quoting two left intellectuals who counsel folks to vote for her. Hillary's Wall Street-friendly arch-corporatism and hawkish militarism are well understood in very predominantly white establishment business and imperial circles, where she is by far and away the preferred candidate. This is true even among many normally Republican members of the economic, political, policy, and 'ì in a word 'ì power elite. 
Identity politics provides cover for, and diversion from, class rule and from the deeper structures of class, race, gender, empire, and eco-cide that haunt American and global life today 'ì structures that place children of liberal white North Side Chicago professionals in posh 40 th -story apartments overlooking scenic Lake Michigan while consigning children of felony-branded Black custodians and fast food workers to cramped apartments in crime-ridden South Side neighborhoods where nearly half the kids are growing up at less than half the federal government's notoriously inadequate poverty level. Most of the Black kids in deeply impoverished and hyper-segregated neighborhoods like Woodlawn and Englewood (South Side) or North Lawndale and Garfield Park (West Side) can forget not only about going to a World Series game but even about watching one on television. Their parents don't have cable and the Fox Sports 1 channel. There's few if any local restaurants and taverns with big-screen televisions in safe walking distance from their homes. Major League Baseball ticket prices being what they are, few of the South Side kids have even seen the White Sox 'ì Chicago's South Side American League team, whose ballpark lacks the affluent white and gentrified surroundings of Wrigley Field. (Thanks in no small part to the urban social geography of race and class in Chicago, the White Sox winning the World Series in 2005 'ì their first championship since 1917, marking an overcoming of the Black Sox Curse 'ì was a smaller deal in the city than the Cubs going to the World Series this year.) 
The World Series might be playing out before a national and even global audience just miles away in hyper-Caucasian Wrigley Ville, but for tens of thousands of Black and Latino kids on the city's South, West, and (in fact) North Sides (there are significant stretches of minority poverty west and north of the Cubs' storied ballpark), the games are being played in another universe. 
Hillary, a Cubs fan from the affluent northern white Chicago area suburb of Park Ridge (though also a self-declared Yankee fan during her years 'representing Wall Street as a Senator from New York' [her own words]) isn't going to remotely change any of that. She has a long record as a vanguard neoliberal Democrat (a de facto 'moderate' Republican) going back to the Clintons' days in Arkansas, where and when she played a key role in helping move the Democratic Party ever further away from its last lingering commitments to social, racial, and environmental justice and decency. 
I may be a 'far left radical' stamped as a White Sox fan by family upbringing and a childhood on the South Side. Still, I am going to make the most both of the Cubs going to the World Series and of Hillary trouncing Trump. Much as I wish the Sox were headed for their second championship in eleven year (they held first place in the American League Central Division for a few weeks last spring), I have to admit that nothing can beat the heartwarming story of the 'lovable losers' the Cubs going to the October Classic when it comes to boosting the profile of baseball relative to that of the sadistically violent, brain-mashing blood sport called U.S. football. It is a telling tragedy that the beautiful pastoral game of baseball has been trounced by the vicious, fascist-lite spectacle that is U.S. football as the nation's favorite sport in the neoliberal era. 
Plus, I have nice memories of my father taking me up to enemy territory to watch National League baseball in Wrigley Field in the late 1960s, before it became a Yuppie playground and a tourist attraction. You could sit in Wrigley's bleachers for $1.50. 
Like all good leftists, I hate the Clintons, including the ones with two x chromosomes 'ì and that includes young Chelsea, with her noxious $10 million condo complex in Manhattan Still, I do not await a Hillary Clinton administration with undiluted trepidation. The presence of a Democrat in the nominal top U.S. job can be usefully instructive for young workers and citizens. It helps demonstrate the richly bipartisan nature of the American plutocracy and Empire. The people need to see and experience how the intolerable misery and oppression imposed by capitalism and its evil twin imperialism live on when Democrats hold the White House. At the same time, the presence of a Republican in the White House tends to fuel the illusion among progressives and others that the main problem in the country is that the wrong party holds executive power and that all energy and activism must be directed at fixing that. It just feeds the electoral and candidate obsessions that do so much to divert us from building and expanding the kinds of rank and file social movements required to bringing about an actually progressive transformation. 
There is, yes, I know, the problem of Democrats in the White House functioning to stifle social movements and especially peace activism (the antiwar movement has still yet to recover from the Obama experience). But there's more good news here about a Hillary presidency. Not all Democratic presidents are equally good at shutting progressive activism down. As the likely Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein (for whom I took five minutes to early vote in a 'contested state' three weeks ago) noted in an interview with me last April (when the White Sox still held first place in their division), Hillary Clinton will have considerably less capacity to deceive and bamboozle progressive and young workers and citizens than Barack Obama enjoyed in 2007-08 . 'Obama,' Stein noted, was fairly new on the scene. Hillary,' by contrast, 'has been a warmonger who never found a war she didn't love forever!' Hillary's corporatist track record 'ì ably documented in Doug Henwood's book My Turn: Hillary Clinton Targets the Presidency (her imperial track record receives equally impressive treatment in Diana Johnstone's volume Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton ) 'ì is also long and transparently bad. All that and Mrs. Clinton's remarkable lacks of charisma and trustworthiness could be useful for left activism and politics in coming years. 
For what it's worth, the first and most urgent place to restore such activism and politics is in the area where Barack Obama has been most deadening: foreign policy, also known (when conducted by the U.S.) as imperialism. When it comes to prospects for World War III, it is by no means clear that the saber-rattling, regime-changing, NATO-expanding, and Russia-baiting Hillary Clinton is the 'lesser evil' compared to the preposterous Trump. That's no small matter. During a friend's birthday party the night the Cubs clinched the National League pennant, I asked fellow celebrants and inebriates if they were prepared for the fundamental realignment of the space-time continuum that was coming when the North Siders won the league championship. That was a joke, of course, but there's nothing funny about the heightened chances of a real downward existential adjustment resulting from war between nuclear superpowers when the 'lying neoliberal warmonger' Hillary Clinton gets into office and insists on recklessly imposing a so-called no-fly zone over Russia-allied Syria. 
Postscript : Meanwhile, could we save some love for the poor and mostly working class sports fans of Cleveland? They didn't vote for their one and only Major League Baseball team to be named the Indians and bear a noxious racist logo. Until LeBron James delivered on his basketball promise last spring they hadn't won a major sports professional championship in fifty-two years. In the years since 1948, the last time the Indians won the World Series, Cleveland has had two such champions: the football Browns in 1964 and the basketball Cavaliers earlier this year. Over the same period, Chicago has accumulated four National Hockey League (NHL)/Stanley Cup championships (1961, 2010, 2013, 2015), six NBA (basketball) championship (the 1990s Michael Jordan Bulls), two NFL (football) championships (the Bears in 1963 and 1985-86), and one World Series (the officially unlovable White Sox in 2005). That's Chicago 13, Cleveland 2 (9 to 2 if you subtract hockey since Cleveland has never had an NHL team). That said, I'm still rooting for the Cubs for three reasons: (1) I may be from the South Side but I'm also from Chicago and have lived on the North Side at different times; (2) the Cubs becoming a dynasty (a distinct possibility given the talent and youth of their team the money behind it) will be good for baseball versus football (3) the truly disgusting atrocity that is Chief Wahu.

As an old SDS-er, I found it hard to see Tom Hayden go. However meandering his path, he was at the heart of radical history in the 60s, an erstwhile companion, if not always a comrade, on the route of every boomer lefty. 
One of his finer moments for me, which I've never seen mentioned (including among this week's encomia) since he wrote it, was his 2006 article , published on CounterPunch with an introduction by Alexander Cockburn, in which he apologized for a 'descent into moral ambiguity and realpolitick that still haunts me today.' It would be respectful of Hayden's admirers and critics, on the occasion of his passing, to remember which of his actions 'haunted' him the most. 
The title of the article says it clearly: 'I Was Israel's Dupe.' In the essay, Hayden apologizes for his support of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, which was for him that 'descent into moral ambiguity' More importantly, he explains why he did it, in a detailed narrative that everyone should read. 
Hayden sold out, as he tells it, because, in order to run as a Democratic candidate for the California State Assembly, he had get the approval of the influential Democratic congressman Howard Berman. Berman is a guy who, when he became Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was proud to tell the Forward that he took the job because of his 'interest in the Jewish state' and that: 'Even before I was a Democrat, I was a Zionist.' 
Hayden had to meet with Howard's brother Michael, who, acting as 'the gatekeeper protecting Los Angeles' Westside for Israel's political interests,' told Hayden: 'I represent the Israeli Defense Forces''îa sentence that could serve as the motto of most American congress critters today. The 'Berman-Waxman machine,' Hayden was told, would deign to 'rent' him the Assembly seat on the 'one condition: that I always be a 'good friend of Israel.'' 
But American congressmen were not the only 'gatekeepers' through whose hands Hayden had to pass before being allowed to run for Congress. Other 'certifiers' included 'the elites, beginning with rabbis and heads of the multiple mainstream Jewish organizations,'¶ the American-Israel Political Action Committee (AIPAC), '¶[and].. Israeli ambassadors, counsels general and other officials.' 
In fact, Hayden had to, in his words, be 'declared 'kosher' by the ultimate source, the region's representative of the state of Israel,' Benjamin Navon, Israel's Counsul-general in Los Angeles. 
In other words, in this article Hayden was describing, in an unusually concrete way, how the state of Israel, through its state officials and their compliant American partners, was effectively managing'îexercising veto power over Democratic Party candidates, at the very least'îAmerican elections down to the level of State Assembly . In any constituency 'attuned to the question of Israel, even in local and state elections,' Hayden knew he 'had to be certified 'kosher,' not once but over and over again.' 
This experience prompted Hayden to express a 'fear '¶that the 'Israeli lobby' is working overtime to influence American public opinion on behalf of Israel's military effort to 'roll back the clock' and 'change the map' of the region.' Hayden warned of the 'trepidation and confusion among rank-and-file voters and activists, and the paralysis of politicians, especially Democrats,' over support of Israel. He vowed to 'not make the same mistake again,' and said: 'Most important, Americans must not be timid in speaking up, as I was 25 years ago.' 
Whatever else he did'îand he was never particularly radical about Palestine'îthis article was a genuinely honest and unusual intervention, and it deserves a lot more notice'îas a moment in Tom Hayden's history and that of the American left'îthan it has got. Looking back and regretfully acknowledging that one had been duped and morally compromised by what seemed the least troublesome path 25 years earlier, saying 'I woulda, shoulda, coulda done the right thing,' is a haunting moment for anyone. Doing it in a way that exposes in detail how a foreign country constantly manipulates American elections over decades is worthy of everyone's notice. 
I doubt Hillary and her Democratic supporters will have anything to say about this 'interference 'in American elections, even local and state. But I do hope many of those who are touched by the loss of Tom Hayden heed these words from him, and don't wait another 25 years to overcome their 'fear and confusion' about saying and doing the right thing regarding the crimes of Israel, troublesome as that might be.

According to the mainstream media, in a recent speech in West Palm Beach, Donald Trump finally completely lost it. Sawing the air with his tiny hands in a unmistakeably Hitlerian manner, he spat out a series of undeniably hateful anti-Semitic code words '¶ like 'political establishment,''global elites' and, yes, 'international banks.' He even went so far as to claim that 'corporations' and their (ahem) 'lobbyists' have millions of dollars at stake in this election, and are trying to pass the TTP, not to benefit the American people, but simply to enrich themselves. He then went on to accuse the media of collaborating with 'the Clinton machine,' presumably to benefit these 'global elites' and 'international banks' and 'lobbyists.' 
Now, a lot of folks didn't immediately recognize the secret meanings of these fascistic code words, and so mistakenly assumed that 'global elites' referred to the transnational capitalist ruling classes, and that 'lobbyists' referred to actual lobbyists, and that 'banks' meant '¶ well '¶ you know, banks. As it turned out, this was completely wrong. None of these words actually meant what they meant, not in anti-Semitic CodeSpeak. So the mainstream media translated for us. 'Political establishment' meant 'the Jews.''Global elites' also meant 'the Jews.''Banks' meant 'Jews.''Lobbyists' meant 'Jews.' Even 'corporate media,' meant 'Jews.' Apparently, Trump's entire speech was a series of secret dog-whistle signals to his legions of neo-Nazi goons, who, immediately following Clinton's victory, are going to storm out of their hidey holes, frontally attack the US military, overthrow the US government, and, yes, you guessed it '¶'kill the Jews.' 
OK, maybe I'm exaggerating the mainstream media's reaction just a little bit. Or maybe Trump's speech really was that fascistic. Judge for yourself. Read the transcript. ( NPR offers a complete version of it here. ) Then compare the reactions of The Wall Street Journal , The New York Times , Washington Post , The Inquirer , The Guardian , and other leading broadsheets, and magazines and blogs like Mother Jones , Forward , Slate , Salon , Vox , Alternet , and a host of others, most of which rely on Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League and former Special Assistant to the President, as their authoritative source on Trumpian cryptology. (Mr. Greenblatt, incidentally, should know better, given the treatment he has received from hard-line Zionist publications for refusing to demonize Black Lives Matter, and for 'taking sides against' the State of Israel.) 
Look, I'm not defending Donald Trump, who I consider a self-aggrandizing idiot and a soulless huckster of the lowest order, and whose supporters include a lot of real anti-Semites, and racists, and misogynists, and other such creeps. I'm simply trying to point out how the corporate media have, for months, been playing the same hysterical tune like an enormous Goebbelsian keyboard instrument, and how millions of Americans are singing along (as they were before the invasion of Iraq, which posed no threat to the USA , but which according to the media had WMDs), and how terribly fucking disturbing that is. In case you didn't instantly recognize it, the name of the tune is 'This guy is Hitler!' and it isn't the short vulgarian fingers of Donald Trump that are tickling the ivories. And no, it isn't 'the Jews' either. It's the corporate media, and the corporations that own them, and the rest of the global capitalist ruling classes '¶ in other words, those 'global elites.' 
The thing I find particularly disturbing is how these rather mundane observations 'î i.e., (a) that a global ruling class exists, (b) that it's primarily corporate in character, (c) that this class is pursuing its interests and not the interests of sovereign states 'î how such observations are being stigmatized as the ravings of unhinged anti-Semites. This stigmatization is not limited to Trumpists. Anyone to the left of Clinton is now, apparently, an anti-Semite. For example, Roger Cohen, in The New York Times , riding the tsunami of condemnation of the insidious verbiage of Trump's West Palm speech, executed an extended smear-job on Jeremy Corbyn and his 'Corbynistas' (they're fond of coining these epithets, the media), denouncing their virulent 'anti-Americanism,''anti-Capitalism,''anti-globalism,' and 'anti-Semitic anti-Zionism.' 
Which, let me hasten to add, and stress, and underscore, and repeatedly emphasize, is not to imply that the Labour Party, or the British Left, or the American Left, or any other Left, is anti-Semitism-free. Of course not. There are anti-Semites everywhere. That isn't the point. Or it isn't my point. 
My point is that this stigmatization campaign is part of a much larger ideological project, one that has little to do with Trump, or Jeremy Corbyn, or their respective parties. Smearing one's political opponents is nothing new, of course, it's as old as the hills. But what we're witnessing is more than smears. As I proposed in these pages back in July , political dissent is being gradually pathologized (i.e., stigmatized as aberrant or 'abnormal' behavior, as opposed to a position meriting discussion). Consider the abnormalization of Sanders, back when he was talking about 'banks,''global elites,' and other things that matter, or the media's portrayal of British voters as racists in the wake of the Brexit referendum. And, yes, the charges being leveled against Trump, much as we might despise the man. Anti-Semitism, inciting violence, paranoid conspiracy theorizing, insurrection, treason, et cetera 'î these are not legitimate arguments one needs to counter with superior arguments; they are symptoms of deviations from a norm, signs of criminality or pathology, which is increasingly how the corporate ruling classes are dismissing anyone who attempts to challenge them. 
A line is being drawn in the ideological sand. On one side of it are the decent people, the normal people, in their business wear, with their university degrees, and prescriptions, and debts. On the other side are '¶ well, the deplorables, the ignorant, racist, anti-Semitic, neo-nationalist, populist extremists. This line cuts through both the Left and the Right '¶ supersedes both Left and Right, making bedfellows of supposed adversaries like Obama, Clinton, Kagan, Wolfowitz, Scowcroft, and their ilk on the Normal team, and a motley crew of Trumpists, Putinists, European populists, Corbynistas, Sandernistas, socialists, anarchists, Wikileakers, anti-Zionists, anti-capitalists, neo-Nazis, Black Lives Matterers, angry Greek pensioners, environmental activists, religious zealots, the Klu Klux Klan, David Graeber, most of the contributors to CounterPunch, and various other 'extremist' types, many of whom detest each other, in the Deplorables' current starting line-up. 
The corporate media is sending a message '¶ a message aimed at a much broader audience than undecided American voters (assuming such creatures really exist). The message is, 'get with the fucking program, or get stigmatized as an anti-Semite, or a racist, or a Russian spy, or whatever.' The message is, 'drop the populist rhetoric, shut the hell up about the Wall Street banks, and the corporations, and the 'one percent,' and '¶ actually '¶ forget about politics completely, except for identity politics, of course. Go ahead and knock yourself out with that.' The message is, 'you're either with us or against us '¶ and it doesn't matter why you're against us, or what it is you think you're for. Right, Left '¶ who gives a shit? It's one big Basket of Deplorables to us.' 
This message, of course, displays many of the hallmarks of the classic authoritarian mentality, the need for nearly total conformity, mindless allegiance to one's so-called superiors, delegitimization of all opposing viewpoints, and the infantile type of hero-worship figures like Obama and Clinton inspire '¶ not the old-fashioned authoritarianism that would-be despots like Trump represent, but, rather, a more attractive version, a hopey, changey, lovey version, where there are no frightening Hitlerian leaders barking out anti-Semitic code words, and no one is exterminating thousands of people in faraway countries they want to destabilize in order to entirely dominate the region. No, this is the version where Obama sells the TPP on the Jimmy Fallon show, and wars of aggression are not wars of aggression, but 'humanitarian interventions.' It's also the version where universal healthcare is, regrettably, 'unrealistic,' but $38 billion for the State of Israel so it can operate its Apartheid State, and weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, so they can bomb the shit out of farmers in Yemen, and cut off people's heads for blasphemy, is somehow in 'America's vital interests.' 
But what do I know? I'm just a satirist. I should probably leave all this complex stuff, like what is and isn't in my interest, and what words really mean and all that, to the experts in the mainstream media. Since they did so well decoding Trump's speech, maybe they could translate some of these other code words I've been having trouble with, like the ones I put in scare quotes above, or other such code words, like 'enemy combatant,''free trade agreement,''security barrier,''indefinite detention,''targeted killing,' or 'troubled asset relief program.' 
I could go on, but I probably shouldn't. Odds are, I'm already on the list of Putin-worshiping, anti-Semitic, racist, misogynist, neo-nationalist, non-standing up for the National Anthem, conspiracy theorizing America-haters. The last thing I need to do at this point is start jabbering about how the United States is an authoritarian corporatist dystopia ruled by a global capitalist elite that couldn't give less of a shit about Americans (or any other actual people living in any other actual countries), where the corporate media can whip up mass fanatical support for wars of aggression, or corporate puppets, by pointing their fingers at yet another bogeyman and shouting 'Hitler' at the top of their lungs. Next thing you know I'd be writing about 'banks,' and 'global corporations,' and 'national sovereignty,' and we all know what that's about, don't we?

While the recent police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott has led to increased scrutiny on police activities in North Carolina, police-community relations are not the only reason racial tensions are flaring. While encounters with police officers can radically differ depending on the race of those involved, access to economic resources tend to follow a similar pattern. Although racial gaps regarding wealth, incomes, and healthcare are nationwide issues, observing them from a statewide perspective can help understand why specific communities feel maltreated. 
A UNC Chapel Hill study found that the income and wealth disparities between African Americans and whites in North Carolina are far worse than the national average. It states that: 
'¶black households, at the median, claim only about 13 percent of the wealth and, stunningly, about 4 percent of the net worth of white households. The corresponding figures for the nation are bleak: 15 and 13 percent respectively. Median wealth for white households is roughly seven times that of black households'¶Nationally, black households have about half the home equity of whites. In North Carolina, it's about a third. 
The study goes on to state that half of all black households in North Carolina have under $100 in savings. At the median, black heads of household aged between 50 and 65 own $17,000 in assets compared to white households' median of $143,000, which seriously hampers older, black workers from retiring comfortably. This data paints a picture of a state that fails to allow black communities from advancing economically and obtaining some semblance of equality. 
The issue is further exasperated by lack of access to health insurance. A North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services study found that 13% of North Carolina whites have no health insurance as compared to 22% of blacks. 16% of whites were reported to be in 'fair or poor' health as compared to 23.2% of blacks. The Kaiser Family Foundation research shows that the majority of non-elderly uninsured North Carolinians were minorities: 30% Hispanic and 14% black, while 10% were white. This is especially concerning considering minorities experience disease at a higher rate than American whites, and visit the doctor at much lower rates. The result: communities most in need of medical assistance are least likely to attain it. 
This imbalance is in part due to the state government's failure to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, something which would have significantly reduced the coverage gap between those receiving Medicaid and those obtaining income-based subsidies. The North Carolina Justice Center finds that, had the expansion gone through, 500,000 low-income North Carolinians would have health insurance who currently don't have it, and over 1,000 unnecessary deaths would have been prevented. 
While the protests in Charlotte appeared to be a backlash against apparent police brutality, underlying economic factors also come into play. A breaking point will eventually be reached by those living in undesirable economic situations which they view as consequential of a racist and unfair system. 
The case of North Carolina is a particularly negative one, but the principles outlined in this research are not unique to North Carolina. Americans cannot expect race relations to cool until access to income, wealth, and healthcare are equalized and structured in a fair, equitable manner. More articles by: Patrick Carr next -

The Yemen war uniquely combines tragedy, hypocrisy and farce. First come the casualties: around 10,000, almost 4,000 of them civilians. Then come those anonymous British and American advisers who seem quite content to go on 'helping' the Saudi onslaughts on funerals, markets and other obviously (to the Brits, I suppose) military targets. 
Then come the Saudi costs: more than $250m (¬£200m) a month, according to Standard Chartered Bank 'ì and this for a country that cannot pay its debts to construction companies. But now comes the dark comedy bit: the Saudis have included in their bombing targets cows, farms and sorghum 'ì which can be used for bread or animal fodder 'ì as well as numerous agricultural facilities. 
In fact, there is substantial evidence emerging that the Saudis and their 'coalition' allies 'ì and, I suppose, those horrid British 'advisers' 'ì are deliberately targeting Yemen's tiny agricultural sector in a campaign which, if successful, would lead a post-war Yemeni nation not just into starvation but total reliance on food imports for survival. Much of this would no doubt come from the Gulf states which are currently bombing the poor country to bits. 
Mundy points out that a conservative report from the ministry of agriculture and irrigation in the Yemeni capital Sana'a, gathered from its officers across the country , details 357 bombing targets in the country's 20 provinces, including farms, animals, water infrastructure, food stores, agricultural banks, markets and food trucks. 
These include the destruction of farms in Yasnim, the Baqim district of Saadah province and in Marran. Mundy has compared these attacks with figures in the Yemen Data Project, which was published some weeks ago. Her verdict is a most unhappy one. 
'According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, 2.8 per cent of Yemen's land is cultivated,' Mundy says. 'To hit that small amount of agricultural land, you have to target it.' Saudi Arabia has already been accused of war crimes, but striking at the agriculture fields and food products of Yemen in so crude a way adds merely another grim broken promise by the Saudis. 
The kingdom signed up to the additional protocol of the August 1949 Geneva Conventions which specifically states that 'it is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock'¶for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population'¶whatever the motive'¶' 
The fact that Yemen has long been part of Saudi Arabia's proxy war against Shiites and especially Iran 'ì which has been accused, without evidence, of furnishing weapons to the Shia Houthi in Yemen 'ì is now meekly accepted as part of the Middle East's current sectarian 'narrative' (like the 'good' rebels in eastern Aleppo and the 'very bad' rebels in Mosul). So, alas, have the outrageous bombings of civilians. But agricultural targets are something altogether different. 
Academics have been amassing data from Yemen which strongly suggests that the Saudis' Yemen campaign contains a programme for the destruction of rural livelihood. 
Martha Mundy, emeritus professor at the London School of Economics, who is currently working in Lebanon with her colleague Cynthia Gharios, has been researching through Yemeni agriculture ministry statistics and says that the data 'is beginning to show that in some regions, the Saudis are deliberately striking at agricultural infrastructure in order to destroy the civil society'. 
In a lecture in Beirut, Mundy has outlined the grievous consequences of earlier economic policies in Yemen 'ì cheap American wheat from the 1970s and the influx of food from other countries which discouraged farmers from maintaining rural life (terracing of farms, for example, or water husbandry) 'ì and the effect of Saudi Arabia's war on the land. 'The armies and above all air forces of the 'oil-dollar',' she said, have ''¶come to destroy physically those products of Yemeni labour working with land and animals that survived the earlier economic devastation.' 
There are photographs aplenty of destroyed farms, factories and dead animals lying in fields strewn with munitions 'ì effectively preventing farmers returning to work for many months or years. Poultry and beehive farms have been destroyed. 
Even today, more than half the population of Yemen relies in part 'ì or wholly 'ì on agriculture and rural husbandry. Mundy's research through the files of other ministries suggests that technical support administration buildings for agriculture were also attacked. The major Tihama Development Authority on the Red Sea coastal plain, which was established in the 1970s 'ì and houses, as Mundy says, 'the written memory of years of 'development' interventions' 'ì is responsible for a series of irrigation structures. It has been heavily bombed twice. 
But I guess that one war 'ì or two 'ì in the Middle East is as much as the world can take right now. Or as much as the media are prepared to advertise. Aleppo and Mosul are quite enough. Yemen is too much. And Libya. And 'Palestine''¶

With Hillary Clinton's victory in the bag, there's a growing fear that her presidency will begin with a bang: regime change in Syria. Clinton has said as much. Last year Reuters reported that 'removing President Assad' would be Clinton's 'top priority.' 
This regime change sentiment was echoed more recently by her foreign policy adviser, Jeremy Bash, who said that Clinton would ''¶work to get Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, 'out of there.' 
More spectacularly has been Clinton's repeated insistence during debates that a 'no fly zone' should be implemented in Syria, which, as the Libyan experiment proved, is a euphemism for regime change and war. 
The fact that such blatant warmongering can go unchallenged is itself a major PR victory for the establishment. The anti-war movement seems speechless, immobile in the face of yet another war. 
This paralysis is due, in part, to the Left's splintering over Syria, where vicious infighting over a consistent anti-war perspective has spoiled debate. 
Instead of focusing on stopping the next war, the Left continues to bicker about who deserves the most blame for the Syrian catastrophe. As a result, working people are left in the dark about the U.S. role in the Syrian war. They don't know the U.S. has been leading a proxy war against the Syrian government, and they are unprepared for the full-scale military intervention that remains a real possibility. 
The vast educational void around Syria is being filled, in part, by mainstream politicians, such as moderate Congressional Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, who sounds 'radical' when she recently wrote in an online petition: 
'The war to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad is creating more devastation, human suffering, and refugees'¶Have we learned nothing from Iraq and Libya? We must end our [U.S.] war to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad now.' 
If only most Left groups spoke as clearly as Gabbard about Syria, whose petition is only radical because the Left has so thoroughly minimized the U.S. role in funding, arming, training, and coordinating the proxy war against the Syrian government. 
A key mistake some Left groups make is focusing their anti-war actions on 'all sides,' wrongly believing that this alone is an internationalist approach against imperialism and war. But a critical component gets ignored when this principle is clung to. 
Stopping the U.S. war on Syria requires that U.S. activists actively educate and focus on the U.S. role, so that people can be agitated into action and mobilized by the tens of thousands. The principled 'pox on both houses' approach leads, in practice, to inaction, making it an empty phrase when what is needed is a concrete strategy for effective on the ground organizing. 
The essence of a revolutionary, internationalist approach to anti-war strategy was summarized by Leon Trotsky, when he said 'In the struggle against imperialism and war the basic principle is: 'the chief enemy is in your own country.'' 
The quote is a guide to action for those living in imperialist countries, and the U.S. remains the world's foremost imperialist country. Syria is not an imperialist country. 
The focus, therefore, for U.S. anti-war activists should be on the U.S.' actions abroad in order to mobilize to stop it. An internationalist approach is working to minimize the harm that your imperialist country can do to the working class abroad. 
All anti-war organizers should base their actions on this premise, since this truism allows for the most effective anti-war strategy when put into practice. Straying from this principle can get you into serious trouble. 
It's in your own country where you actually organize people on the ground, where they can be educated and mobilized directly against the government to apply direct pressure. 
Writing the occasional anti-war article that analyzes the various bad actors is fine, but when it comes to the realm of action and organizing, focus is required. You cannot organize effectively against all sides. Your efforts must be prioritized where you can have the most impact, and where your efforts cannot be co-opted by your government as war propaganda. 
Your own government is the enemy because its foreign policy is dictated by the same U.S. corporations that exercise power domestically, who exploit workers in the U.S., who don't pay taxes in the U.S., and who fund anti-worker legislation domestically. 
Some of these same corporations want raw materials, contracts, and new markets abroad, and will bomb the world to smithereens to get it. The fight against war always starts at home. 
As Fred Halstead wrote in the groundbreaking work 'Out Now,' the anti-Vietnam war movement was strong when it focused on educating and mobilizing U.S. society, from students, veterans, union members, etc., while also directly agitating U.S. troops stationed in Vietnam, who were emboldened by the mass rallies they saw at home. When U.S. soldiers began organizing against their officers by refusing to fight, the war could no longer continue. The excellent documentary 'Sir No Sir' shows the power of organizing active duty military personnel. 
The anti-Vietnam war movement didn't focus on the violence of the North Vietnamese, or the role played by China and the U.S.S.R., they focused on the role played by the U.S., and because of this they were able to effectively educate and mobilize hundreds of thousands of people, stop the war, and effect a cultural change in the U.S. where for decades it was politically impossible to enact direct military intervention. 
A similar approach was used by the Russian revolutionaries in World War I, where a massive anti-war movement was created, not by agitating against the Germans 'î who were arguably the aggressors 'î but by focusing first on the Czar of Russia, and then on the Russian capitalists who wanted to continue the war after the Czar's downfall. The mobilization for 'peace' grew to be one of the pillar demands of the successful revolution. 
U.S. Left groups needn't focus on the 'evils' of Russia or the Syrian government; huge resources are already spent on this by multi-billion-dollar media conglomerates. Demonizing the enemy of U.S. imperialism doesn't help U.S. workers in terms of mobilizing to stop the war. In fact, demonizing 'the enemy' helps keep workers passive, since it makes the war appear 'moral.' 
A good example of this grave mistake comes from the International Socialist Organization (ISO), whose recent article criticizes the new antiwar coalition 'Hands Off Syria.' The article reads: 
'U.S. Hands Off Syria is exclusively focused on opposing U.S. military intervention and what it claims is Washington's determination to achieve regime change in Syria. But this means the coalition and those who endorse it ignore the main source of the barbaric violence and repression in Syria today: the Assad government, its allies within the region and the Russian empire that backs Assad to the hilt'¶.' 
Hands Off Syria keeps true to the antiwar maxim 'the chief enemy is in your own country,' and the ISO ridicules them for it. 
The same article goes on to slander Hands Off Syria by accusing them of ''¶supporting a dictator like Assad and an imperialist power like Vladimir Putin's Russia.' This 'pro-Assad' slander has been aimed at anyone 'î this writer included 'î who focuses their fire on the U.S. involvement in the Syrian conflict. The smear campaign has ruined the discussion around Syria, helping to mis-educate people who might otherwise be organized into action. 
The ISO fails to mention in its article that Hands Off Syria specifically mentions that 'It is not our business to support or oppose President Assad or the Syrian government. Only the Syrian people have the right to decide the legitimacy of their government.' 
The ISO calls Hands Off Syria 'pro-Assad' because the group says, correctly, that Syria has the right to self-determination. In a nutshell 'self-determination' means that non-imperialist countries, like Syria, have a right not to be interfered with by imperialist countries, such as the United States. 
All revolutionaries have a duty to uphold this core tenant of anti-imperialism. Watering this principle down 'î because 'Assad is a brutal dictator' 'î is another example of undercutting both theory and action around anti-war work. 
The main demands of the Hands Off Syria coalition are completely supportable from an internationalist, socialist perspective, and deserve mention, since they went unmentioned in the ISO article that attacked them: 
1 An immediate end to the U.S. policy of forced regime change in Syria and full recognition and compliance by the U.S., NATO and their allies with principles of international law and the U.N. Charter, including respect for the independence and territorial integrity of Syria. 
2 An immediate end to all foreign aggression against Syria, and serious efforts toward a political resolution to the war. 
3 An immediate end to all military, financial, logistical and intelligence support by the U.S., NATO and their regional allies to all foreign mercenaries and extremists in the Middle East region. 
4 An immediate end to economic sanctions against Syria. Massive international aid for displaced people within Syria and Syrian refugees abroad. 
Hands of Syria is a united front coalition that should have existed for several years; its late arrival is due to the gutter-level Syria debate among Left groups. So attacking this big step forward in anti-war work only detracts from the anti-war movement, and thus empowers the U.S. government to act with a freer hand in Syria. 
A consistent antiwar approach means combining theory with action, going beyond intellectual exercises and into organizing. If an antiwar theory equals inaction in the face of war, that perspective is exposed as moribund, lifeless. An antiwar approach must have practical applications to movement politics, a way to connect with and mobilize the masses. 
Blaming 'all sides' has the unintended consequences of pacifying working people in the face of war, since the kind education that might agitate them into action 'î their own government's actions 'î is being either minimized or crowded out by nonstop comparisons with the 'worse' actions of other governments (those in the cross-hairs of U.S. imperialism). 
To put anti-war work into practice, every effort must be made to explain the history of the U.S. intervention in Syria, and how this intervention continues today, and how the logic of this intervention inevitably leads to a full scale military confrontation, as very nearly happened in 2013 when Obama backed down from attacking the Syrian government. 
A revolutionary approach to war lies in exposing the lies of the capitalist media and politicians, so that workers understand the propaganda that is leading them into war, so they can be prepared to mobilize against it when war breaks out. Anything less is an academic exercise, divorced from the realities of the class struggle in the U.S. 
Most conflicts have several precipitating factors, so ascribing blame to who fired the first shot or who was the 'most savage' cannot be a guiding force in anti-war work. It serves mainly to distract, to disorient. By focusing on Russia and Syria, the U.S. war propaganda goes unchallenged, and thus can maintain a powerful stultifying force on working people in the face of war. 
Any mass movement for peace wields revolutionary implications. Especially in the U.S., whose global empire of military bases acts as a stifling conservative political force across the globe, while the domestic politics have been stifled by this same 'military industrial complex.' This behemoth of concentrated power will require an equal power to demobilize it, and that power can only be the working class mobilized. 
Any effective anti-war work must stay true to the basic principles elaborated by Trotsky decades ago: 
'The transformation of imperialist war into civil [class] war is that general strategic task to which the whole work of a proletarian party during war should be subordinated.' 
The enemy remains at home.

The increasing symbiosis between the political and the leading mainstream media of the Western world implies that, grosso modo, Russia is blamed for having caused this new situation. While Russia is certainly not innocent and it usually does take two to conflict this blame is rather a sign of diminishing capacity (knowledge) and will (economic and intellectual independence and courage) to ask critical questions that now characterise the corporate media. 
Defence and security political news coverage, journalistic processing, editing and commentaries have sunk to an intellectual level that is considerably lower than during the first Cold War. The entire field is given low priority by editors. Domestic issues, sports, entertainment, lifestyle etc. have made it to the top. 
Out of sync with the globalising world, most media do with 1-2 pages about global affairs out of, say, 40-50 pages and they base this material on the same handful of Western news bureaus. 
The double checking of a variety of sources, versatility and multi-perspective coverage are things of the past and we see more uniformity and more subjectivity in the news media coverage than ever. 
Add to this that both Russia and NATO countries engage in media management, or propaganda (tax payers footing the bills) which squeezes out comprehensive knowledge and unbiased analyses as well as critical angles on one's own policies and actions. 
Like hot wars, Cold Wars are fought not only on the battle fields but also in the media, about the souls of the citizens. Fearology, therefore, has become a dominant ingredient in this war as well as in the other 'ì equally counterproductive and self-defeating 'ì war, the War On Terror. 
The more people are made to fear, the more they submit to surveillance, authoritarian laws, self-censorship etc and turn away from democratic debate and activism 'ì a trend that will eventually lead to the dissolution of democracy itself. 
In short, these international trends and tension-increasing confrontations boomerang back on our societies in ways that are as frightening as under-stated in the debate. 
To put it crudely: the new Cold War and the War on Terror both have significant, destructive effects on society, diminish its democracy and creativity, narrows the spectrum of opinions and bring us further and further away from the globally desired goals of freedom, democracy and of living in a more peaceful world. 
Security politics has come to mean destruction of the core fibres of what was to be secured. Paradoxically, it promotes the closing of the once open society. 
In addition, that is, to squandering absurd US $ 1700 billion (or about 30 times the entire UN budget) worldwide on one more destructive, failed war after the other. 
These are issues of the greatest importance for humanity's future, even survival.

Did Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, actually read the full text of the UNESCO resolution on Palestine and Israel, before he raved with anger? 
'I think this is a mistaken, inconceivable resolution,' he said. 
'It is not possible to continue with these resolutions at the UN and UNESCO that aim to attack Israel. It is shocking and I have ordered that we stop taking this position (his country's abstention) even if it means diverging from the position taken by the rest of Europe,' he added. 
Renzi, who became Prime Minister in 2014 at the relatively young age of 39 knows exactly how the game is played. In order to win favor with Washington, he must first please Tel Aviv. 
His country has abstained from the October 12 vote on a resolution that condemns Israel's violations of the cultural and legal status of Occupied East Jerusalem. This decision has ignited the ire of Israeli Ambassador to Rome, Ofer Zaks, who riled up the Jewish community in Italy to protest the abstention. Renzi, in turn, was converted into a champion of the 'Temple Mount', the name Israel uses to describe the Palestinian Muslim holy site. 
Renzi cravenly went on damage control mode without truly understanding the nature of the resolution, which merely condemned Israel's obvious violations of international law, and only calls for Israel to respect the status of Palestinian culture in the occupied city. 
None of procedures that led to the vote on the UNESCO's resolution 'ì voted by 24-6, with 26 abstentions 'ì violated protocol, nor was any of the wording inconsistent with international law. In fact, UNESCO was merely doing its job: attempting to protect and preserve the historical and cultural heritage of the world. 
Jerusalem is a sacred and a holy city to a majority of humanity, simply because it is significant to the spiritual wellbeing of the adherents of the three monotheistic religions. In fact, the resolution stated so: 
'Affirming the importance of the Old City of Jerusalem and its Walls for the three monotheistic religions '¶' 
Renzi's outburst is quite disappointing, to say the least, for the young, eager politician simply tried to score cheap political points with Israel 'ì thus the United States 'ì without a full, or even partial comprehension of what the UNESCO resolution resolved. Nor did he seem aware of the fact that such text is largely a repeat of what has been discussed by the world's leading cultural organization in April, and repeatedly before that date. 
'If anyone wants to say something about Israel, let them say it, but they should not use UNESCO'¶ To say that the Jews have no links to Jerusalem is like saying the sun creates darkness,' he said, paraphrasing the sentiment displayed by the Israeli Prime Minister. 
It would be rather sad if Renzi sees a mentor in Benjamin Netanyahu, for the latter is one of the least liked world leaders who has made a mockery of international forums and derided the United Nations itself as anti-Semitic and its process as 'theater of the absurd'. 
This is what Netanyahu had said in response to the resolution and shortly before he suspended his country's membership in UNESCO. Using a language that is as amusing as his cartoon depiction of the Iranian nuclear bomb in his famous UN spectacle in 2012, he said: 
'To say that Israel has no connection to the Temple Mount and the Western Wall is like saying that China has no connection to the Great Wall of China or that Egypt has no connection to the Pyramids.' 
Other Israeli officials followed suit with a chorus of denunciations, included Israeli President, Reuven Rivilin, who described the decision as an 'embarrassment' for UNESCO. Culture Minister, Miri Regev, cut to the chase, by labeling the resolution 'shameful and anti-Semitic.' 
In fact, it was neither. 
In addition to Renzi's odd reaction, the United States and other western governments reacted with exaggerated anger, again without even addressing the situation on the ground, which prompted the resolution 'ì and numerous other UN resolutions in the past 'ì in the first place. 
Even the Czech parliament jumped on board, voting to condemn what they described as a 'hateful, anti-Israel' sentiment.' 
I have read the resolution repeatedly to pinpoint the specific text that could possibly be understood by Israel's friends as hateful, to no avail. The entirety of the text was based on past international conventions, resolutions, international law, and refers to Israel as the Occupying Power, as per the diktat of the Geneva Conventions. 
The Italian, Czech, American anger is, of course, misdirected and is largely political theater. 
But, of course, there is an important context that they refuse to address. 
Israel is working diligently to appropriate Muslim and Christian heritage in East Jerusalem, a city that is designated by international law as illegally occupied. 
The Israeli army and police have restricted the movement of Palestinian worshipers and is excavating under the foundation of the third holiest Muslim shrine, Haram al-Sharif, in search of a mythological Temple. 
In the process of doing so, numerous Palestinians, trying to defend their Mosque from the attacks staged by Israeli occupation forces and extremist Jewish groups, have been killed. 
How is UNESCO to react to this? 
The resolution merely, 'called on Israel' to 'allow for the restoration of the historic status quo that prevailed until September 2000, under which the Jordanian Awqaf (Religious Foundation) Department exercised exclusive authority on Al-Aq·π£a Mosque/Al-·∏§aram Al-Sharif.' 
Moreover, it 'stressed', the 'urgent need of the implementation of the UNESCO reactive monitoring mission to the Old City of Jerusalem and its Walls.' 
Where is the 'hate' and 'Anti-Semitism' in that? 
Israel's anger is, of course, fathomable. For nearly fifty years, following the illegal occupation and annexation of the Palestinian Arab city, Israel has done everything it could possibly do to strip the city of its universal appeal and Arab heritage, and make it exclusive to Jews only 'ì thus the slogan of Jerusalem being Israel's 'eternal and undivided capital.' 
Israel is angry because, after five decades of ceaseless efforts, neither UNESCO nor other UN institutions will accept Israel's practices and designations. In 2011, following the admission of 'Palestine' as a member state, Israel ranted and raved as well, resulting in the US cutting off funding to UNESCO. 
The latest resolution indicates that Israel and the US have utterly failed to coerce UNESCO. 
What also caused much fury in Tel Aviv is that UNESCO used the Arabic references to Haram al-Sharif, Al-Aqsa Mosque and other Muslim religious and heritage sites. The same way they would refer to Egypt's Pyramids of Giza and China's Great Wall by their actual names. Hardly anti-Semitic. 
Since its establishment atop Palestinian towns and village, Israel has been on a mission to rename everything Arabic with Hebrew alternatives. Recent years have seen a massive push towards the Judaization of Arab Christian and Muslim sites, streets and holy shrines, a campaign spearheaded by the Israeli right and ultranationalist groups. 
To expect UNESCO to employ such language is what should strike as 'absurd'. 
Not only should the UNESCO resolution be respected, it should also be followed by practical mechanisms to implement its recommendations. Israel, an Occupying Power should not be given a free pass to besiege the holy shrines of two major world religions, restrict the movement and attack worshipers, annex occupied territories and destroy what is essential spiritual heritage that belongs to the whole world.

The decision whether to allow the commercialisation of the first genetically modified (GM) food crop (mustard) in India rumbles on. As I have previously discussed here, the bottom line is government collusion over GM crop technology (that is not wanted and not needed) with transnational agribusiness, which is trying to hide in the background. 
The real story behind GM mustard in India is that it presents the opportunity to make various herbicide tolerant (HT) mustard hybrids using India's best germ plasm, which would be an irresistible money spinner for the developers and chemical manufacturers (Bayer-Monsanto). GM mustard is both a Trojan horse and based on a hoax. 
Various high-level reports (listed here) have advised against introducing GM food crops to India. Allowing for not one but three GMOs (which is what the GM mustard in question constitutes, when we include its two crucial GM parental lines) is according to campaigner Aruna Rodrigues a serious case of regulatory 'sleight-of-hand', permissible due to diluted rules to ensure easy compliance. 
If allowed to go through, India will be forced to accept a highly toxic and unsustainable technology suited to monocropping. HT GM crops would be particularly unsuitable for its agriculture given the large number of small farms growing a diverse range of crops alongside mustard that contribute towards agricultural biodiversity and, in turn, diverse, healthy diets. 
The processes being used to push through GM mustard are, according to this writ by Rodrigues, based on fraud and unremitting regulatory delinquency. She argues that the whole system is in addition being protected by a subterranean process of regulation that has also broken India's constitutional safeguards by keeping the biosafety data hidden from the nation. 
Rodrigues says, 'These matters require criminal prosecution.' 
New development 
The government has now told the Supreme Court (SC) that it won't release GM mustard without the court's say so. At the same time, however, it strongly opposes the writ filed by Rodrigues. 
In an affidavit response to Aruna Rodrigues' writ, however, the Union of India revealed something that merited a press release from the civil organisation Navdanya and Aruna Rodrigues (presented in full below this article). 
According to the press statement, the government's response contained an admission by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) itself that no claim had been made in any documents submitted to it that HT Mustard DMH 11 out-performs non-GMO hybrids. 
So then, what is the point of GM mustard? And what were all the claims being made in media about GM mustard outperforming non-GMO hybrids by 25-30% in yield? 
According to the press statement, that claim was also made by the developers (Dr Pental and his team at Delhi University) and is clearly recorded by the media. It also notes that the claim of superior yield was implied in the Supreme Court (SC) during a 'hearing' (24 October) on India's import bill for edible oil. 
The press statement says: 
'It is now clear, by the GEAC's own admission, that DMH 11 does not out-yield India's best non-GMO cultivars and this includes hybrids against which this mustard was not tested.' 
Navdanya and Aruna Rodrigues ask: 
'Therefore, what is the Union of India's point? Is this HT mustard being introduced because of its ability to just make hybrids? Given that it does not outperform our non-GMO hybrids, the argument collapses on its essential lack of science and reasoned thinking.' 
They conclude that this HT Mustard DMH 11 is not needed 'ì which is in fact the first step of a risk assessment protocol for GM crops! 
HT mustard DMH 11 will make no impact on the domestic production of mustard oil, which was a major reason why it was being pushed in the first place. The argument was that GM mustard would increase productivity and this would help reduce imports of edible oils. Implicit in this was that India's farmers were unproductive and GM would help overcome this. 
While it is clear that India's imports of edible oils have indeed increased, this is not as a result of an underperforming home-grown sector. India essentially became a dumping ground for palm oil. Until the mid-1990s, India was virtually self-sufficient in edible oils. Then import tariffs were reduced, leading to an influx of cheap (subsidised) edible oil imports that domestic farmers could not compete with. 
This was a deliberate policy that effectively devastated the home-grown edible oils sector and served the interests of palm oil growers and US grain and agriculture commodity company Cargill, which helped write international trade rules to secure access to the Indian market on its terms. It therefore came as little surprise that in 2013 India's then Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar accused US companies of derailing the nation's oil seeds production programme. 
Supporters of GM twisted this situation to call for the introduction of GM mustard to increase productivity. 
Now their arguments on virtually each and every count have been shown to be erroneous and constitute little more than a cynical ruse to facilitate Bayer-Monsanto GM food crops and associated agropoisons entry into India. 
PRESS RELEASE 
UNION OF INDIA REPLY AFFIDAVIT 20/21 OCT 2016 
GEAC STATES: 'NO CLAIM MADE THAT DMH 11 OUTPERFORMS NON-GMO HYBRIDS' 
'No such claim has been made in any of the submitted documents that DMH 11 out-performs Non-GMO hybrids. The comparison has only been made between hybrid DMH 11, NC (national Check) Varuna and the appropriate zonal checks 'î MSY of 2670 Kg/ha has been recorded over three years of BRL trials which is 28% and 37% more than the NC & ZC respectively'. (Ref. U of India Reply Pg 55 point 86-88) 
Petitioner Comment: 
With this statement, the Union of India effectively buries its own 'raison d'√™tre' for its HT Mustard DMH 11. The following points may be noted: 
(a) The claim of a 25-30% increase in yield may not have technically been made in the SC. This adherence to a technicality is mischievous to the extreme, but much more moot is that the Regulators by this argument cut the grass from under their own feet. 
The above yield is indeed the claim by the Developers, clearly recorded by the Media and strangely in the SC by implication, by bringing in the issue of our import bill for edible oil in the 'Hearing' of the 24th. The claim is: 
¬∑ That the superior yield of this HT mustard DMH 11, (that despite there being NO TRAIT for YIELD in the Barnase-Barstar system with the Bar gene glufosinate), through its HYBRID-MAKING capability is superior to Non-GMO cultivars in the Country. 
(b) The Petitioners' have proven without doubt based on RTI data that DMH 11 field trials were fraudulent, and specifically on the question of DELIBERATELY poor-yielding Comparators used in the field testing of HT Mustard DMH 11 in the BRL I & II field trials . 
NOTE: By this statement the Government concedes the argument that DMH 11 does not out-yield India's best NON-GMO cultivars and this includes HYBRIDS against which this mustard was not tested in BRL I &II trials (2010-11 onwards). Therefore, what is the Union-of India's point? Is this HT mustard being introduced because of its ability to JUST make HYBRIDS? Given that it does not outperform our Non-GMO hybrids, the argument collapses on its essential lack of science and reasoned thinking. 
CONCLUSION 
¬∑ This HT Mustard DMH 11 is NOT NEEDED (the first step of a risk assessment protocol for GM crops ) 
AND 
¬∑ This HT mustard DMH 11 will make no impact on DOMESTIC production of Mustard Oil leave alone the import oil bill of which mustard and Rape together are less than 2% of the total oil import (of 14.3 million Metric Tonnes in 2015-16)

Antecedently, does it matter, period? America transcends its historical development, revealing a cumulative trend which pronounces even presidential elections a solemn farce, as a fascistic societal formation, to all indications, beckons. It is on a collision course with its own destiny, inner tendencies, ideology, and class distribution. Exceptionalism represents a tightly-coiled nation, out of maneuverability, fated to consume itself (and possibly the world) in domestic self-hatred, foreign aggression, and international confrontation as a permanent stance. 
What happened along the way? Its unique attachment to capitalism from at least the late eighteenth century ensured a one-dimensional political-structural course which selectively eliminated, ruled out, or weakened non-capitalistic elements'îa purist formation, then, feeding on itself, creating and maintaining boundaries to social change that ensured against alternative values and pathways to the future. 
Whatever arises from such a context is then turned inward and made adaptable to the needs of a capitalist state and society. The Revolutionary War was one of independence, not transformation, so that America, no longer a colonial appendage of Britain, could exercise its own form of mercantilism, internal colonialism, subjection of indigenous resistance. Likewise, the Civil War cleared the historical slate of premodern capitalism, of which plantation slavery, was the linchpin, to the breakdown of all restrictions, ushering in a laissez-faire capitalism which offered no obstacles to a monopoly-capital consolidative framework. 
In bold, by 1900, America now a certified imperial power, the Open Door policy pursued for three decades already ensuring the drive for universalized market penetration, and a prominent role in world affairs, witnessed the removal of slavery into a social vacuum to be replaced by the exploitation of industrial labor, an agricultural economy controlled by financial, transportation, and marketing interests, and, of course, racism per se as the unmistakable heritage of previous servitude. 
What a start toward greatness (!), a background for the antidemocratic modernization up to today and into the future. Theodore Roosevelt would give us the interpenetration of business and government and the battleship navy, Woodrow Wilson, the federal reserve system, regularization of monopoly, and an internationalism inseparable from anticommunism, as witness the Siberian Intervention into the Bolshevik Revolution. By this point, the die is cast, so that throughout the 'twenties we see, via trade association activity, the privatization of the economy systemically nailed down, the NAM and Chamber of Commerce illustrative of the shaping of the business system. 
The New Deal, under FDR, may be viewed, alternatively, as a break in the historical process of capitalist development, or, on close inspection, a muted effort to graft a welfare state onto business foundations'îas the most American society and social structure could tolerate. But in any case, once more, at a pivotal moment, unable and unwilling to undergo a fundamental transformation. For America, World War II was, by necessity, anti-fascist on the battlefield and with international alliances, yet imperialism and anticommunism had by Bretton Woods defined the postwar vision of America's world direction, FDR's death confirming trends he might have otherwise altered or mitigated. From that point, 1945-6, no internal obstacles remained or were present to arrest the present course: a unilateral posture of global dominance. Anticommunism abroad had its corresponding red-baiting at home, leading to a long-term ideological shrinkage and encrustation of tolerated societal boundaries. 
Kennedy was America's guiding spirit for the liberalization of fascism'îintervention, regime change, nuclear preparedness, made acceptable and plausible through policies and rhetoric of the US as a humanitarian beacon to the world's oppressed (meanwhile enlarging global market shares, financial hegemony, and armed conflict), so that with Johnson and Vietnam America revealed its true identity, which has not changed. In this light, the present campaign and election, filled as it is with copious warnings to the world of America's greatness (coded for military supremacy), extends the past into the future, lacking only the sophistication, ideological and political, of former times able to cement the image of capitalism and democracy. 
America now is nakedly belligerent, on the war path while drastically streamlining its own political economy, as, e.g., through outsourcing, industrial division of labor, and extreme emphasis on the financialization of capitalism itself, combining internal-external processes to hold its position in a world political economy and power system where unilateral prestige and military prowess no long hold, reducing America to one among equals, an intolerable state to a nation habituated to international success. The strain is showing. Clinton and Trump are both playing to an American public coddled by decades of patriotism, antiradicalism, and, treatment of the environment is here instructive, nihilism, whether through the depredation of nature or ignorance with respect to climate change. 
Clinton and Trump, and the political parties and party system that stand behind them, epitomize the logical outcome, viz., moral bankruptcy, of advanced capitalism in America, in which war, militarism, and defense budgets and production all become necessary to avoid economic stagnation or poor growth, while the ideological reproduction of exceptionalism through its various historical stages ensures a blindness to the human costs of impending war. The election is rendered meaningless because continuity has been preserved with an antiradical heritage now transposed into a setting so whipped up with neurotic frustration at having lost undisputed world supremacy and at home increasing wealth and income differentiation that a paralysis of will is setting in, making the militarization of policy (and, via massive surveillance, regimentation or stringent conformity in the political realm) not only thinkable but operable.

The various communities in the state of J & K 'ì Kashmiri Muslims, Kashmiri Pandits, Dogras and Ladakhis 'ì have tried time and again to form a national consciousness in order to name a cultural alterity through the nation. The construction of 'Kashmiriyat,' or a syncretic cultural ethos, by Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and his comrades involved culling selected cultural fragments from an imagined past that would enfold both the Pandits and the Muslims. But due to the regional sentiments that are so well entrenched in the psyche of the people, this attempt is still in a volatile stage. 
The notion of 'Kashmiriyat,' forged by my maternal grandfather Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, was not handed down to me as an unachievable and abstract construct; on the contrary, it was crystallized for me as the eradication of a feudal structure and its insidious ramifications; the right of the tiller to the land he worked on; the unacceptability of any political solution that did not take the aspirations and demands of the Kashmiri people into consideration; the right of Kashmiris to high offices in education, the bureaucracy and government; the availability of medical and educational facilities in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh; the preservation of literatures, shrines and historical artifacts that defined an important aspect of 'Kashmiriyat'; formation of the Constituent Assembly of J & K to institutionalize the constitution of the state in 1951, which was an enormous leap toward the process of democratization; the fundamental right of both women and men to free education up to the university level; equal opportunities afforded to both sexes in the workplace; the nurturing of a contact zone in social, political and intellectual ideologies and institutions; pride in a cultural identity that was generated in a space created by multiple perspectives. 
The notion of 'Kashmiriyat', or of the syncretism of Kashmir, as I mentioned earlier, was the secular credo of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah's All Jammu and Kashmir NC, popularized in the 1940s and 50s to defeat the centralizing strategies of the successive regimes of independent India. This significant concept does not attempt to simplify the ambiguity and complexity of religious, social and cultural identities. It neither attempts to assert a fixed identity nor reinforce the idea of purity of culture. I would veer away from adopting an image of this secular credo that is created by the unitary discourses it deplores. On the contrary, 'Kashmiriyat' brings about a metamorphosis in the determinate concept of the Indian state, and creates a situation in which the nation-states of India and Pakistan are forced to confront an alternative epistemology. At a time of political and social upheaval in the state, this notion engendered a consciousness of place that offered a critical perspective from which to formulate alternatives. Without negating the historicity of the notion, this theoretical fiction was deployed by Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and his colleagues in order to forge a strategic essentialism that would enable the creation of a sovereign Kashmiri identity. It certainly was not a flawless notion. Professor R. L. Hangloo, eminent historian of Kashmiri Pandit descent provided a complex and concise definition of ' Kashmiriyat ': 
' Kashmiriyat is a far wider concept than the harmonious relationship cutting across religious and sectarian divisions. Kashmiriyat is the externally endowed and internally evolved phenomenon of co-existence at the social, religious, political, spatial, cultural and other institutional levels among Kashmirees of all shades that inhabited Kashmir. Kashmiriyat has evolved as a result of special circumstances that are rooted in Kashmir's topographical centrality that entitled Kashmir to imbibing, interacting and assimilating a variety of world cultures in consonance with Kashmiri sensibilities that reflect a nuanced and sophisticated approach that did not disturb the patterns of production and cultural manners reflecting the Kashmiri genius. This specificity has stemmed from the historical processes that the region of Kashmir has embraced both in peace and turmoil for centuries. Kashmir has always been surrounded by some of the world's greatest civilizations such as China, Persia/Iran, Central Asia and India. Kashmir and Kashmirees were always at the center of this world and not on the periphery which is reflected in the assimilation of their residual practices of religions. Note that while Kashmir maybe on a fairly marginal point on the map of the state of India, Kashmir as a region was historically at the epicenter of a much larger world space and world civilization. This centrality endowed the region with a superiority and self identity that has assimilated the social and religious-cultural traditions of this greater region and traits of greater cultures throughout history to evolve and strengthen what came to constitute Kashmiriyat . This sense of superior self identity has grown over centuries as Kashmiriyat among Kashmirees both within and out side Kashmir. 
Living together, untroubled by diversities of religion, racial, cultural, material, and political and other identities, the notion of Kashmiriyat became the bedrock of identity which consolidated itself increasingly when Islam entered into the Valley. Before the thirteenth century, even though there were plural religious sects, they neither saw eye to eye with each other nor were they external to Kashmir in totality. Shaivites facilitated the decline of Buddhists in Kashmir; the Vaishnavas had to keep their identity concealed to escape the wrath of the Shaivites. The pre-Islamic history is replete with religious, ethnic, racial and other conflicts. The battles of Dammaras, Ekangas, Tantrins, Khasas and others were perpetual features of pre-Islamic Kashmiri society. There was a long drawn conflict and contestation within Islamic society before rapprochement took place between the orthodox Muslims and heterodox sects. The entrance of Islam in Kashmir coincided with the end of this struggle. It was this rapprochement that disallowed Kashmirees from seeing any contradiction between the preaching of Islam and the practice of upholding the Heretical tradition (that is, acknowledging the divine power of the local, the Rishi) in Kashmir. Therefore the kind of Islam that entered Kashmir was devoid of any orthodoxy. It was only after the arrival of Islam that Lalleshwari and Sheikh Noor 'ìud-din (Nund Reshi) interacted to produce the atmosphere and philosophy of co-existence and tolerance at popular level. This interaction entailed massive changes in the world view of Kashmirees that reflected a truly remarkable and world encompassing shift in every aspect of their sensibility as well.' 
Uncertainty about the status of the former princely state has loomed large since 1947. In an atmosphere of unpredictability, in the frightening darkness of political intrigue, in the paranoia of political deception, the fungi of undemocratic policies and methods continue to grow unabated. The unresolved Kashmir dispute poses a danger of monstrous proportions to the stability of the Indian subcontinent. Is the former princely state of J & K a postcolonial state? Postcolonialism refers to a phase undergone after the decline and dismantling of the European empires by the mid-twentieth century, when the peoples of many Asian, African and Caribbean countries were left to create new governments and forge national identities. The ideology that has been propounded by the governments of India and Pakistan reflects and produces the interests of state-sponsored agencies and institutionson both sides of the Line of Control (LOC). These institutions have couched the debased discourse of exploitation in the language of culture and religion, a strategy that has led to the relegation of the subjectivity, historical understanding and traditions of the Kashmiri populace. As the eminent Palestinian'ìAmerican scholar Edward Said (1991: 29) noted, 'All human activity depends on controlling a radically unstable reality to which words approximate only by will or convention.' Representatives of the privileged centre of power silence the voices that are on the margins of mainstream society and politics. These privileged centres have always constrained reality by imposing their ideological schema, which underpins their powerful positionality, on it. Their ability to conjure images and re-stretch boundaries that serve their set of beliefs has rendered them a force to reckon with. These ideas expounded by the powers-that-be portray Kashmiris as a stereotypical and predictable entity. 
This delineation of the Kashmiri subject was foregrounded by an imperial agent of the British Raj, Sir Walter Lawrence, Settlement Commissioner of J & K, in his The Vale of Kashmir ([1895] 2005). This politically and culturally misleading portrayal of the Kashmiri subject has been underscored by the policies of the governments of India and Pakistan vis-√†-vis Jammu and Kashmir, which is why the authority of democratically elected representatives in that region has always been curbed. The policies of the two governments follow the much-trodden path of totalitarianism and spell a pattern of doom for Kashmir. The unnecessary and unjustified postponement of the resolution of the Kashmir conflict has insidiously gnawed at the tenuous relations between India and Pakistan. The issue has also, for better or worse, been thrust on to the stage of global politics, and its volatility has contributed to the destabilization of the Indian subcontinent. Josef Korbel (2002: 304) wrote with foresight that 'whatever the future may have in store, the free world shares with India and Pakistan common responsibility for the fate of democracy and it awaits with trepidation the solution of the Kashmir problem. Its own security may depend on such a settlement.'

'Yes, I listen when I first wake up, maybe while getting the children ready for school; sometimes in the car too.' They're talking about radio. Radio was supposed to become a marginal medium, surpassed first by TV and then, surviving that, it would be buried by the internet. Yet radio is still with us. More than surviving, radio has introduced new ways of speaking, conversing and telling stories. A whole new sound has been created for example by Atlantic Public Media ( www.atlantic.org ). Meanwhile some traditions continue. 
Except that my very favorite radio show for almost three decades fits no tradition:'îit's part comedy, part advice column, part phone call-ins. (Listener call-ins gave radio a tremendous boost in the 1960s.) 
I continue to be a radio addict. As a critic of government policies, an aficionado of literary readings, and a producer of 'RadioTahrir' ( www.RadioTahrir.org ) for 23 years on the avant-garde and activist Pacifica Network ( www.Pacifica.org ) you'd expect my favorite to be a show related to political or literary enterprise. Actually, the program I listen to most faithfully is one that's impossibly dissimilar. It's CarTalk . This, though I'm not even a car enthusiast. 
CarTalk is a hilarious, practical advice call-in show. It originated in Boston 30 plus years ago by two feisty Italian brothers Tom and Ray Magliozzi, both garage mechanics (the do-it-yourself-sort; but to figure out their degree qualifications see www.cartalk.com/content/tom-and-rays-bios-photos-2), a perfectly paired team with a shared irrepressible sense of humor. 
Think about it. How often while listening to a non-comedy radio broadcast do you find yourself chuckling? Not only this: these hosts engage in banter and howls of laughter while dispensing serious counsel 'ìall having to do with cars! Threaded though the humor is lots of useful (and reliable) car advice. (They really have to be good because of safety liability, the reputations both of cars they discuss and garage mechanics their guests already consulted.) The stimulus for Tom's and Ray's comments are calls from listeners challenging the brothers with simple, complex and silly car problems: mechanical problems, disputes with their local mechanic, family predicaments around co-ownership, repair costs, holiday motoring anxieties, and inheritance problems (cars often pass from parents to children). The issues are actual problems which cars, especially older models, experience. And Americans keep their cars for a long time. 
CarTalk , in my view, is the most engaging program on US radio, on radio anywhere. A weekly one hour show, it's been airing every Saturday morning as long as I can remember. With the passing of Tom the older member of the team in 2014, the live broadcast ended. Today the program continues as The Best of Car Talk , edited from their archives. Meanwhile www.cartalk.com carries a full show, highlighted moments of fun (or guidance), automotive news, and abundant free car advice. 
Part of the success of the program, in addition to the spirited character and compatibility of the brothers, lies what cars symbolize in American history and culture. People grow very fond of their cars and are reluctant to part with them, thus the need for repairs to keep them functioning well past their dump-yard date. (We think we can fix our car ourselves'îwith a little advice.) An owner feels proud that her car's odometer registers 200,000 miles, or if it approaches 170,000 (as my 1985 Toyota did) we're determined to keep it running (as I did), whatever the cost, until it cracks 200,000. No car owner likes to spend money on repairs either, so Tom and Ray's advice mustn't require a lot of expense. Then there are the mechanical mysteries that emit from a car: you know, those rattles under the hood or the scraping below the passenger seat. So we turn to CarTalk to address our doubts or after our own local mechanic hasn't performed a cure for our ailing 1968 Chevy pickup, or our limping 1992 Honda Civic.. 
The brothers seem to know every car model ever made, from 1950s vintage Fords to the latest Swedish, Chinese and Indian brands. After IDing their location a caller starts with: 'I have a 1978 Volkswagen bus whose windshield wipers don't work'¶..', or 'I and my husband are going to take cross country trip with our 3 dogs, two rabbits and a parrot; we can't pay more than $3000. and plan to dump the vehicle once we arrive; what should we buy?' Tom and Ray try to diagnose the issue and dispense advice, injecting guidance with abundant hilarity, while never, never reproaching or ridiculing a caller. The hour is upbeat, always hilarious, and the advice is highly reliable and, it seems, mostly spot-on. 
The personalities of the brothers and the chemistry between them explain much of CarTalk 's popularity. But this program taps into our American romance with cars and our attachment to these celebrities of manufacturing history. Cars enjoy an unparalleled place in American life. Desoto, Mustang, Studebaker, Roadster, Impala:'ì these names are deeply embedded in the American lexicon. Each represents an image fixed in our memory, in the brains even of young people born long after a model ceased being manufactured. Cars represent key points in millions of Americans' lives, in the latter 20 th century if not now. Famous songs eulogize cars; cars are the subject of poems; 'Motown' is the trope for Detroit city, center of auto manufacturing for decades, and the music genre that emerged there. 
A driving license, not a pair of Nike trainers or the latest iphone edition, was and still is for many, the primary goal of a US teenager. We started saving for our first car even before we had our driver's license; cars compete with sports to occupy 90% of young men's conversations. We concocted quiz games about cars and car models. There is an entire industry in the U.S. devoted to auto museums, small scale car models, and road functional antique cars. Cars parked in residential driveways are part of American architecture. In my town, I recognize my neighbor by the color and model of their passing car. We can usually gauge a person's income by the model of their car. 
Whatever the caller's car model, one of the brother's recognizes it'î1972 El-Camino, 1959 Ford Torino, 1990 Dodge Viper, 1980 Desoto Adventurer, or 1966 Volkswagen bus. (Most callers seek advice for only 20 plus year-old vehicles.) These radio hosts seem to know any car's mechanics and particularities that could cause problems. Instead of saying 'Take it to the junk yard; it's past 250,000 miles', they do their utmost to help extend its life. They treat the car like it's a family pet. Only occasionally Tom would advise an owner'î'It's only a car!'

Bradley Birkenfeld held a book launch party at the National Press Club tonight. 
And it is telling that he invited some of the nation's top whistleblowers 'î including John Kiriakou who spent two years in prison 'î to be his guests. 
One of the ironies that was not lost on anyone in the room is that increasingly, it's not corporate executives but whistleblowers who are doing jail time. 
Birkenfeld himself blew the whistle on his employer, the giant Swiss bank UBS, where the rich and famous stashed their millions in numbered accounts to evade U.S. tax authorities. 
Guess who went to jail? 
Birkenfeld. 
A copy of Birkenfeld's book 'î Lucifer's Banker: The Untold Story of How I Destroyed Swiss Bank Secrecy 'î was given to each guest at the book launch. 
And tucked inside was a book mark 'î a laminated copy of the check that Birkenfeld got from the U.S. government for helping recover over $15 billion from American tax cheats. 
The government paid Birkenfeld $104 million as a bounty, but the check is made out to Birkenfeld in the amount of $75 million. (Why minus $29 million? Taxes.) 
This is perhaps one of the best corporate crime books ever written. 
And the reason is that it clearly exposes our system of no fault corporate crime. 
Deferred prosecutions. Non prosecutions. Neither admit nor deny consent decrees. Executives rarely sent to jail. 
Just have the corporation write a check. Thank you. 
Birkenfeld exposes the perverse outcomes of that system at almost every turn. 
It's not just that whistleblowers are doing prison time and corporate executives are not. 
It's that when corporate executives are sent to jail 'î 
Well, take the case of Joe Nacchio. 
While doing his 30 months in prison at Schuylkill Federal Correctional Institution in Minersville, Pennsylvania, Birkenfeld ran into Nacchio. 
'Joe Nacchio had been the President and CEO of Qwest, a huge telephone company,' Birkenfeld writes. 'He was close to the Bush people, even visiting the White House on occasion. Shortly after 9/11, the Bush administration had gone to all the phone companies and demanded their customer records and email. AT&T and Verizon had caved right away, but Joe told the Feds to fuck off.' 
'We're a private company,' Naccio said. 'I can't do that' 
'Yes, you can,' said the Bushies. 'Matter of national security.' 
'It's unconstitutional,' Joe protested. 'Without warrants from a judge, on a case-by-case basis, I won't do it.' 
'Oh, really?' 
'So the Bushies charged him with insider trading and put him away for seven years. Joe's replacement at Qwest got the message, and the Feds got the records.' 
I'm in Washington and I like this book because it exposes the system of no fault corporate crime enforcement. 
But a lot of people in Washington are not going to like this book. 
Birkenfeld asks some pointed questions 'î including 'î why was the Department of Justice so reckless as to allow UBS to disclose the identities of only 4,700 (including some relatively low income dentists) of the 19,000 illegal account holders? 
Those protected probably included many names you would recognize. 
Why were these names never made public? 
That's why Hillary Clinton is not going to like this book. 
Birkenfeld recounts the deal Clinton cut with the Swiss that Birkenfeld says kept the big names secret. 
Prior to Clinton's deal with the Swiss, UBS had only seen fit to contribute $60,000 to the Clinton Foundation, 'an amount that wouldn't even cover the bank's annual parking tickets,' Birkenfeld writes. 
'Afterward the Clinton Foundation's cash registers rang up $600,000 in UBS gifts,' he writes. 'The bank also decided to partner with the Foundation on some inner-city development programs, issuing a $32 million loan at very reasonable rates. Oh, and suddenly UBS also thought that Bill Clinton would make a very fine paid speaker about global affairs, so they paid him $1.52 million for a series of fireside chats with the bank's Wealth Management Chief Executive, Bob McCann. It was Bill Clinton's biggest payday since leaving the office of the Presidency.' 
Most of the lawyers who Birkenfeld ran into are not going to like this book because they are caught up in the corporate crime industrial complex that defines inside the beltway lawyers. 
For example, when Birkenfeld approach Skadden Arps partner Bob Bennett to take his case against UBS, Bennett begged off. 
'Don't tell me Bob, they're your client,' Birkenfeld asked. 
'They're everyone's client,' Bennett tells Birkenfeld. 'That's what all the major financial firms do, especially if they have big interests and lobbyists here in Wonderland. They put everyone on retainer. It's like buying lawsuit insurance.' 
But most importantly, the Justice Department is not going to like this book because Birkenfeld says it's not about the facts, the law and justice. 
It's about brute corporate power. 
Why did the Department of Justice fail to fine UBS adequately 'î settling for only $780 million in 2009 'î not even commensurate with the billions of dollars illegally earned in profits by UBS over many decades? 
Why did the Department of Justice release from custody two of the most senior UBS executives who oversaw this massive fraud? 
Birkenfeld says it's about corporate connections. 
Which he lays out in intimate detail. 
At the book launch party, Birkenfeld said he had sent a copy of the book to the President Obama at the White House. 
'The American taxpayers need to know why the Department of Justice took such extraordinary actions to protect the perpetrators of the largest tax fraud in history.' 
'Why the keen interest to shield from the American public all of those getting a free ride off the backs of tax-paying, law-abiding citizens? I ask you Mr. President, what will you do to investigate these serious injustices?' 
That question Birkenfeld asked sort of tongue in cheek. 
After all, Birkenfeld knows about Obama's UBS connection. 
In August 2009, on the first Sunday after Birkenfeld was sentenced in prison, at the Farm Neck Golf Club in Martha's Vineyard, President Barack Obama had strolled out onto the links. 
'His golfing partner that day was Robert Wolf, Chairman of UBS Americas,' Birkenfeld writes. 'I'm sure it was a fine day of patter and play, guarded by a throng of Secret Service agents, and I wondered if Obama and Wolf had high-fived over my downfall, or maybe sent a 'good job' text to (the sentencing judge.) But I'd never know, because much like Swiss bankers, Secret Service agents don't talk.'

In classical mythology, the Acheron is one of the rivers of the Underworld. It marks the boundary between the living and the dead. The ferryman Charon ferries the dead across the Acheron to a place where they lose memory. Nothing of what made them human remains'îhappiness, suffering, love, hatred, guilt, regret, redemption, betrayal, forgiveness. 
From Gilgamesh to Odysseus to Aeneas, the living heroes of the epic descend into the Underworld at a point of despair in the sense of their quest. Burdened by a fate that requires momentous courage and tragic self-sacrifice for the sake of their people's survival, they resent the absurdity of their lot. Down there on a visit, they return from the shadow land strengthened. They recognize that the business of living is not oblivion but action. 
John Marciano's recently published book, The American War in Vietnam: Crime or Commemoration ? functions as such a Charon in reverse. It ferries readers back to the realm of remembering. This slim volume could not have come at a more opportune moment. American political culture is punch-drunk with the pursuit of war. The altered state is reaching the point of delirium tremens. Thwarted in the neocolonial scheme of annexing Syria by Russia's legal intervention, the American elite are pushing for confrontation. Though it is hard to think the unthinkable, the nuclear holocaust may happen if not by intention then by spontaneous combustion from over-intoxication with the fumes of war. 
This reckless confrontation results from decades of accumulated unaccountable power. Its boldness reflects a cumulative experience of impunity for aggressive behavior by soft and hard neocolonial postures since the end of WW II. The war in Vietnam, as Marciano suggests, should have functioned as the lesson that checked the nation's historical thrust for conquest, but the turning point would have required a national effort to relinquish the myth of the Noble Cause, the delusion that America is vested with a divine mandate to assimilate the people of the world to the American image'ìfor the people's own good. Britain had its White Man's Burden; France its mission civilatrise ; America its Manifest Destiny. 
This timely volume traces the war to the apocalyptic finale of the most powerful military in the world defeated by the determination, courage, and self-sacrifice of a peasant people unwilling to be enslaved. But this is as much a book about the past as it is about the present. It reminds us, with Tolstoy, 'The reality of war is in the killing, ' a realization officialdom would like to block. In fact, they have prepared a falsifying celebration of that moral and military debacle. 
As Marciano writes in his introduction, 
'In May 2012, President Barack Obama and the Pentagon announced a Commemoration of the Vietnam War to continue through 2025, the fiftieth anniversary of the conflict's end. Among the Commemoration's objectives, three stand out: 'to thank and honor' veterans and their families . . . 'to highlight the advances in technology, science, and medicine related to military research conducted during' the war; and to 'recognize the contributions and sacrifices made by the allies'.' 
President Obama claimed in the commemoration announcement speech that the war had been 'an honorable cause.' Marciano challenges this notion. America's historic ideology of the Noble Cause, he writes, rests on the belief that the United States is 
'A unique force for good in the world, superior not only in its military and economic power, but in the quality of its government and institutions, the character and morality of its people, and its way of life.' 
This is the mystical bigotry of a messianic faith typical of empires. Imperial militarism seeks in a Noble Cause the justification for subjugating large chunks of humanity. In the distant past, the Noble Cause may have received the sword directly from a god'îas it did in postcolonial America when it sought to exterminate the native inhabitants. By the anointment of the sword, the divinity also endowed, supposedly, the conquering 'race' with moral superiority. Thus, imperialism, in the perverse arrogance of its twisted psyche, contains the germ of genocide. As a result, the superstition of a superior 'race' has been endured by most of the 'races' on the planet as a most Ignoble Cause. In Vietnam alone, the Big Lie of the Noble Cause sent four million Vietnamese to their death. 
Marciano leaves us in no doubt that the White House and the Pentagon are commemorating a crime. They are falsifying history in order to shape the future, which will be and is the reenactment of the war against Vietnam on a global scale. They want to establish the altar for a 'sacred union,' the nation united behind the Noble Cause of war. On the altar will sit the fetish of the export of the 'miracle of democracy, ' in reality the imposition of regimes of terror such as the Vietnam War planners established in Saigon. We see today in Ukraine that the 'miracle of democracy,' brought to Kiev by the US in 2014 to the tune of five billion dollars, amounts to a handful of dry dust, collected from the WW II graveyard of European Nazism, inciting a lot of blind, anti-democratic and noxious nationalism. 
As through a glass darkly, Marciano shows us that in the war crime against Vietnam we can see reflected the crimes perpetrated today from Afghanistan to Yemen, from Iraq to Syria, from Yugoslavia to Libya and across the African continent. As in Vietnam (the fakery of the Gulf of Tonkin incident), today's war are based on fabricated pretexts; as in Vietnam (napalm and agent orange), today's wars are chemical wars (depleted uranium for Yugoslavia and Iraq; phosphorus for Falluja); as in Vietnam (Hanoi and Haiphong) the bombings destroy urban life, vital infrastructure, schools and hospitals; as in Vietnam (Laos, Cambodia) the bombings spreads out (today to Yemen); as in Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh) the leaders who resist US penetration are demonized (Milosevic, Saddam, Qaddafi, Assad) as enemies of humanity. As in Vietnam, all the wars of today are fought mostly to prevent or reverse independence and self-determination of former colonial places. 
Finally, as in Vietnam the USSR, today's Russia is emerging as the displacement of all the guilt that weighs on the shoulders of the Noble Cause. The Washington Post recently wrote 'the Kremlin annexed Ukraine.' I read it twice'înot 'annexed Crimea,' the standard disinformation, but the whole of Ukraine! Does one laugh or weep? Does one have to take a hallucinogenic to see Russian flags and images of Putin blanketing Kiev instead of Neo-Nazi emblems and images of Bandera? 
The next president will certainly be Hillary Clinton, whom I call 'the centripetal president.' From Republicans to Democrats to Neo-Cons, all converge on endorsing the war candidate. In her consensus war regime, the elite will decide everything. We will not be consulted. This is why The American War in Vietnam: Crime or Commemoration? is a vital read. It calls for our re-democratization'ìto question our leaders, to be skeptical of the media, to avert our eyes from the petrifying stare of the Medusa decked with the aegis of the Noble Cause; to challenge'îeven ridicule'ì the vaunted humanitarianism of an elite of bloodhounds baying for war; to refuse to commemorate war crimes and to work to stop them. 
Above all, we need to remember that the crimes of other governments are the responsibility of the people of those governments'înot of our bombs. Though our elite have abrogated to themselves the power and the right to remake the map of the world by force, we need to reassert the legal principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of a sovereign states if we are serious about peace. We, citizens, do not have the right (or the power, unless we line up behind the power of the militarist state) to change the practices of other states, but we do have the right to demand change for those of our own. Let's start exercising that right. We did for Vietnam; we can do it again. Commemorate the people who protested the war in Vietnam, not the crime the governing elite committed there in our name, as Marciano's book amply documents. 
The US government is now engaged in waging eight wars. We better get busy.

Media coverage has recently been saturated with distressing scenes showing the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, where aerial bombardment has led to a heavy loss of civilian life. The severity of the crisis instinctively makes us want to help 'ì scores of protesters gathered outside the seat of the British prime minister on Saturday holding signs calling on the government to 'Save Aleppo' and impose a 'No-Bomb Zone Now'. While the anger is understandable, the way it is being channeled reflects a circumscribed policy debate 'ì there are other options than a No-Fly Zone, which should be avoided as it would harm rather than help efforts to alleviate the suffering of Syrian civilians. 
In any area of policy, the mainstream debate revolves around policy alternatives that reflect establishment divisions. For example, in economics, 'there is no alternative' to neoliberalism, at least there wasn't until Keynesianism was rediscovered by some elites after the 2008 crisis. The debate over what is to be done over Syria revolves around two policy alternatives: the hawks, including likely next U.S. president, Hillary Clinton, advocate a NFZ and the doves, including the current U.S. administration, maintain that the sanctions regime should be increased. This effectively reflects a division within the establishment on how to proceed. Serious policy alternatives are not discussed. In particular, discussion of increasing aid and support to refugees, surely the most obvious way of directly helping civilians in Syria, and what the UN has called on industrialized countries to do , is curious by its absence. 
This circumscribed debate does not logically follow from its supposed pretext 'ì stopping civilian loss of life. In fact, a NFZ is a policy that would unavoidably lead to civilians dying. Enforcing a NFZ means destroying air defenses, which are located to defend cities 'ì i.e. they are located in areas where there are many civilians. Even the flagbearer for the hawks, Hillary Clinton, has admitted privately that with a No-Fly Zone 'you're going to kill a lot of Syrians'; such intervention will 'take a lot of civilians'. This realization would seem inconsistent with the often-used humanitarian pretext, but it makes sense given Hillary Clinton's recent admission that her top priority in Syria is removing Syrian President Assad. 
There is a clear parallel with the imposition of a NFZ in Libya, which prolonged the conflict and worsened the situation for civilians. NATO bombing directly led to scores of civilian deaths and facilitated the overthrow of the regime by rebel militias that have killed, and are continuing to kill , thousands. Particularly repugnant was the ethnic cleansing of black people , including through public lynching . In a 2013 paper , Alan Kuperman, a Harvard academic, argued that NATO intervention extended the war by a factor of 6 and increased the death toll 7 to 10 times; given that Libya is now a failed state, torn apart by warlords, we can safely say that these estimates were too conservative. President Obama privately calls the situation in Libya a ' shit show '. Only last month a report from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British Parliament found that the humanitarian justification was an insufficient pretext and based on falsehoods, the supposedly limited intervention led 'ineluctably' to regime change, and that the (British) government, and by implication other participating Western powers, did not seriously consider diplomatic alternatives to military action. 
Regardless, the mantra of Western foreign policy is 'it will be different this time' 'ì unlike all recent Western military interventions this one will be limited, successful and won't leave a worse humanitarian situation in its wake. Although, if the dire humanitarian situation in Aleppo necessitates immediate action, then why are there not equally loud calls for action for civilians facing similar situations? U.S. bombing in Manbij and Kobane in Syria and Ramadi and Fallujah in Iraq has resulted in thousands of civilian deaths and flattened entire neighbourhoods ; more than a third of US and UK backed Saudi airstrikes in Yemen have hit civilian sites, including schools , hospitals , weddings and funerals . 
Talking about this is not meant as a distraction or relativization; the fact that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are engaged in similar activities does not make the bombing of Aleppo less objectionable. However, it does raise questions about the motives of those pushing so hard for a no-fly zone. If western foreign policy actors, and their allies in press, were motivated by humanitarian concerns, then surely stopping these atrocities should appear on the policy agenda 'ì especially given that the action required is easier and does not risk war with Russia. 
If humanitarian considerations were really the important factors in the foreign policy debate, then there would be discussion on the legitimacy of aerial bombardment of cities and towns, given that this invariably leads to civilian deaths. International agreements have been successful in making chemical and biological weapons illegal, a prohibition which is generally followed ( though not always ). The first well-publicized use of aerial bombardment, the Nazi bombing of Guernica in 1937, caused righteous, popular outrage. Tragically, however, its use became normalized during the Second World War and a ban on aerial bombing of cities was not included in the post-war international settlement. The fact that this seems so hopelessly idealistic reflects the fact that it is geopolitics, not humanitarian considerations, that govern international relations and foreign policy discussion; human suffering is nothing more than a useful pretext for whatever actions you want to take in order to secure geopolitical advantage. The U.S. and its allies want to remove Syria from Russia's orbit, so therefore the dictator there must go, but airstrikes to support the dictator in Yemen are fine, because the dictator there is a friend of close U.S. ally Saudi Arabia. 
There is an added complication with the NFZ in Syria in that it marks a return to Cold-War era brinkmanship and possible armed confrontation with Russia. The logic of brinkmanship runs that to make geopolitical gains, one must escalate to a level that will make the other side back down, partly by convincing your enemy you are ready to commit irrational acts. There is an inherent danger in this game: both states are nuclear armed and the consequences of a spiral of escalation could be devastating . 
Syria hawks, or what close Obama aide Ben Rhodes called the ' pro-stupid shit ' caucus, argue that a NFZ will lead Russia to effectively back down: for example, Clinton argued that it will 'give us leverage in our conversations with Russia'. (Interestingly, in the exchange this quote from Clinton indicated the war goal: a NFZ will make Russia 'put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track' 'ì i.e. Russia will be forced to accept regime change.) After all, despite the panic in the press, Russia is actually a feeble successor state to a superpower, and would come off worse in a direct conflict with the preeminent might of North America, or so the logic runs. 
However, 'dovish' Western foreign policy actors point to the danger that advanced Russian materiel support to Syria poses to the enforcement of a NFZ. Unlike other recent U.S. military adventures, enforcing a NFZ in Syria could lead to significant, and politically unpalatable, American casualties 'ì pilots will be shot down. This realization means that saner establishment figures are opposed to a NFZ. For example, U.S. Army General Carter Ham, who oversaw the NFZ in Libya, said a NFZ is a 'violent combat action that results in lots of casualties and increased risk to our own personnel'. 
Instead, relative doves like current Secretary of State John Kerry advocate intensifying the sanctions regime against Syria and Russia. Again, this does not seem to be seriously about helping civilians. A leaked UN report has revealed that the existing Western sanctions regime is preventing humanitarian aid and creating a humanitarian disaster that threatens to rival that caused by the Oil-for-Food program in Iraq during the 1990s. The history of sanctions tends to show that the costs are borne by civilians, and a Petersen Institute study of all sanctions incidents since WWII shows that sanctions failed to achieve their goals in about ‚Öî of cases, and are even less successful when applied against enemies and autocrats. 
So, what is to be done? What should people in the West and globally push for to help the people of Syria? Unfortunately, there do not seem to be any quick fixes 'ì the situation in Syria is complex and involves diverse actors, with competing interests. Immediate relief to the refugees fleeing the conflict should be a priority. In terms of foreign policy, campaigning for de-escalation and diplomacy against constant militarism remain the best solutions for the Syrian people, and humanity generally.

The American journalist, Edward Bernays, is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda. 
The nephew of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psycho-analysis, it was Bernays who coined the term 'public relations' as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions. 
In 1929, he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade 'ì behaviour then considered outlandish. One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, 'Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!' 
Bernays' influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War. The secret, he said, was 'engineering the consent' of people in order to 'control and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it'. 
He described this as 'the true ruling power in our society' and called it an 'invisible government'. 
Today, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged. 
Imagine two cities. 
Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people. 
But there is a vital difference. In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them, who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes. There are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory. There is scant mention of civilian casualties. 
In the second city 'ì in another country nearby 'ì almost exactly the same is happening. Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics. 
The difference is that these fanatics are supported, supplied and armed by 'us' 'ì by the United States and Britain. They even have a media centre that is funded by Britain and America. 
Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad guys, condemned for assaulting and bombing the city 'ì which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city. 
Confusing? Not really. Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda. I am referring, of course, to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq, who are backed by the United States and Britain and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria, backed by Russia. One is good; the other is bad. 
What is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003. That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria. 
Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news, the monstrous ISIS and Al-Qaida and al-Nusra and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist, and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today. 
Some may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that Blair was 'vindicated' for what turned out to be the crime of the century. The US television networks produced the same validation for George W. Bush. Fox News brought on Henry Kissinger to effuse over Colin Powell's fabrications. 
The same year, soon after the invasion, I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis, the renowned American investigative journalist. I asked him, 'What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda?' 
He replied that if journalists had done their job, 'there is a very, very good chance we would not have gone to war in Iraq'. 
It was a shocking statement, and one supported by other famous journalists to whom I put the same question 'î Dan Rather of CBS, David Rose of the Observer and journalists and producers in the BBC, who wished to remain anonymous. 
In other words, had journalists done their job, had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying it, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children would be alive today, and there would be no ISIS and no siege of Aleppo or Mosul. 
There would have been no atrocity on the London Underground on 7 th July 2005. There would have been no flight of millions of refugees; there would be no miserable camps. 
When the terrorist atrocity happened in Paris last November, President Francoise Hollande immediately sent planes to bomb Syria 'ì and more terrorism followed, predictably, the product of Hollande's bombast about France being 'at war' and 'showing no mercy'. That state violence and jihadist violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak. 
'When the truth is replaced by silence,' said the Soviet dissident Yevtushenko, 'the silence is a lie.' 
The attack on Iraq, the attack on Libya, the attack on Syria happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the West. The human rights record of a Saddam or a Gaddafi was irrelevant. They did not obey orders and surrender control of their country. 
The same fate awaited Slobodan Milosevic once he had refused to sign an 'agreement' that demanded the occupation of Serbia and its conversion to a market economy. His people were bombed, and he was prosecuted in The Hague. Independence of this kind is intolerable. 
As WikLeaks has revealed, it was only when the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2009 rejected an oil pipeline, running through his country from Qatar to Europe, that he was attacked. 
From that moment, the CIA planned to destroy the government of Syria with jihadist fanatics 'ì the same fanatics currently holding the people of Mosul and eastern Aleppo hostage. 
Why is this not news? The former British Foreign Office official Carne Ross, who was responsible for operating sanctions against Iraq, told me: 'We would feed journalists factoids of sanitised intelligence, or we would freeze them out. That is how it worked.' 
The West's medieval client, Saudi Arabia 'ì to which the US and Britain sell billions of dollars' worth of arms 'ì is at present destroying Yemen, a country so poor that in the best of times, half the children are malnourished. 
Look on YouTube and you will see the kind of massive bombs 'ì 'our' bombs 'ì that the Saudis use against dirt-poor villages, and against weddings, and funerals. 
The explosions look like small atomic bombs. The bomb aimers in Saudi Arabia work side-by-side with British officers. This fact is not on the evening news. 
Propaganda is most effective when our consent is engineered by those with a fine education 'ì Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Columbia 'î and with careers on the BBC, the Guardia n, the New York Times , the Washington Post . 
These organisations are known as the liberal media. They present themselves as enlightened, progressive tribunes of the moral zeitgeist. They are anti-racist, pro-feminist and pro-LGBT. 
And they love war. 
While they speak up for feminism, they support rapacious wars that deny the rights of countless women, including the right to life. 
In 2011, Libya, then a modern state, was destroyed on the pretext that Muammar Gaddafi was about to commit genocide on his own people. That was the incessant news; and there was no evidence. It was a lie. 
In fact, Britain, Europe and the United States wanted what they like to call 'regime change' in Libya, the biggest oil producer in Africa. Gaddafi's influence in the continent and, above all, his independence were intolerable. 
So he was murdered with a knife in his rear by fanatics, backed by America, Britain and France. Hillary Clinton cheered his gruesome death for the camera, declaring, 'We came, we saw, he died!' 
The destruction of Libya was a media triumph. As the war drums were beaten, Jonathan Freedland wrote in the Guardian : 'Though the risks are very real, the case for intervention remains strong.' 
Intervention 'î what a polite, benign, Guardian word, whose real meaning, for Libya, was death and destruction. 
According to its own records, Nato launched 9,700 'strike sorties' against Libya, of which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets. They included missiles with uranium warheads. Look at the photographs of the rubble of Misurata and Sirte, and the mass graves identified by the Red Cross. The Unicef report on the children killed says, 'most [of them] under the age of ten'. 
As a direct consequence, Sirte became the capital of ISIS. 
Ukraine is another media triumph. Respectable liberal newspapers such as the New York Times , the Washington Post and the Guardian , and mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC, NBC, CBS, CNN have played a critical role in conditioning their viewers to accept a new and dangerous cold war. 
All have misrepresented events in Ukraine as a malign act by Russia when, in fact, the coup in Ukraine in 2014 was the work of the United States, aided by Germany and Nato. 
This inversion of reality is so pervasive that Washington's military intimidation of Russia is not news; it is suppressed behind a smear and scare campaign of the kind I grew up with during the first cold war. Once again, the Ruskies are coming to get us, led by another Stalin, whom The Economist depicts as the devil. 
The suppression of the truth about Ukraine is one of the most complete news blackouts I can remember. The fascists who engineered the coup in Kiev are the same breed that backed the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Of all the scares about the rise of fascist anti-Semitism in Europe, no leader ever mentions the fascists in Ukraine 'ì except Vladimir Putin, but he does not count. 
Many in the Western media have worked hard to present the ethnic Russian-speaking population of Ukraine as outsiders in their own country, as agents of Moscow, almost never as Ukrainians seeking a federation within Ukraine and as Ukrainian citizens resisting a foreign-orchestrated coup against their elected government. 
There is almost the joie d'esprit of a class reunion of warmongers. 
The drum-beaters of the Washington Post inciting war with Russia are the very same editorial writers who published the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. 
To most of us, the American presidential campaign is a media freak show, in which Donald Trump is the arch villain. 
But Trump is loathed by those with power in the United States for reasons that have little to do with his obnoxious behaviour and opinions. To the invisible government in Washington, the unpredictable Trump is an obstacle to America's design for the 21 st century. 
This is to maintain the dominance of the United States and to subjugate Russia, and, if possible, China. 
To the militarists in Washington, the real problem with Trump is that, in his lucid moments, he seems not to want a war with Russia; he wants to talk with the Russian president, not fight him; he says he wants to talk with the president of China. 
In the first debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump promised not to be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into a conflict. He said, 'I would certainly not do first strike. Once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.' That was not news. 
Did he really mean it? Who knows? He often contradicts himself. But what is clear is that Trump is considered a serious threat to the status quo maintained by the vast national security machine that runs the United States, regardless of who is in the White House. 
The CIA wants him beaten. The Pentagon wants him beaten. The media wants him beaten. Even his own party wants him beaten. He is a threat to the rulers of the world 'ì unlike Clinton who has left no doubt she is prepared to go to war with nuclear-armed Russia and China. 
Clinton has the form, as she often boasts. Indeed, her record is proven. As a senator, she backed the bloodbath in Iraq. When she ran against Obama in 2008, she threatened to 'totally obliterate' Iran. As Secretary of State, she colluded in the destruction of governments in Libya and Honduras and set in train the baiting of China. 
She has now pledged to support a No Fly Zone in Syria 'î a direct provocation for war with Russia. Clinton may well become the most dangerous president of the United States in my lifetime 'ìa distinction for which the competition is fierce. 
Without a shred of evidence, she has accused Russia of supporting Trump and hacking her emails. Released by WikiLeaks, these emails tell us that what Clinton says in private, in speeches to the rich and powerful, is the opposite of what she says in public. 
That is why silencing and threatening Julian Assange is so important. As the editor of WikiLeaks, Assange knows the truth. And let me assure those who are concerned, he is well, and WikiLeaks is operating on all cylinders. 
Today, the greatest build-up of American-led forces since World War Two is under way 'ì in the Caucasus and eastern Europe, on the border with Russia, and in Asia and the Pacific, where China is the target. 
Keep that in mind when the presidential election circus reaches its finale on November 8 th, If the winner is Clinton, a Greek chorus of witless commentators will celebrate her coronation as a great step forward for women. None will mention Clinton's victims: the women of Syria, the women of Iraq, the women of Libya. None will mention the civil defence drills being conducted in Russia. None will recall Edward Bernays' 'torches of freedom'. 
George Bush's press spokesman once called the media 'complicit enablers'. 
Coming from a senior official in an administration whose lies, enabled by the media, caused such suffering, that description is a warning from history. 
In 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor said of the German media: 'Before every major aggression, they initiated a press campaign calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the German people psychologically for the attack. In the propaganda system, it was the daily press and the radio that were the most important weapons.'

I trust that I am not the only one to have noticed that in rural areas and economically distressed neighborhoods in towns and cities, lawn signs for Donald Trump are everywhere, while Hillary signs are rarer than Teslas and Maseratis. 
I think I understand the Trump signs: they are cries of defiance. 
Hillary's supporters are harder to figure out. I suspect that most of them would just as soon not advertise their intentions November 8. Even if they think that there is no other way to stop Trump, they understand that, by voting for Hillary, they are embarrassing themselves. 
Lawn signs apart, the evidence that Trump is kaput is, by now, overwhelming. He seems finally to have done his campaign in 'ì to such an extent that even diehard anti-Trump fear mongers concede the inevitability of the Clintons' return to the White House. 
Trump's campaign had been on life support for weeks when the pussy grabbing tape surfaced, followed by a seemingly endless stream of women 'ì a dozen or so already 'î accusing the Donald of groping them and worse. 
Then, in the third debate, Trump announced that he would 'wait and see' before accepting the legitimacy of a Clinton victory. This seems to have been the final straw for all but the most bona fide 'deplorables.' 
And so, the writing is on the wall: Hillary will win just as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow 'ì well, not quite, but almost. 
There is no reason to rejoice in her victory, only in Trump's defeat. 
And even that isn't as obvious as it seems . Hillary probably the lesser evil all things considered. But Trump is very likely the less dangerous of the two. 
The man is an adolescent in a septuagenarian's body, with a tendency to act out. But at least he is not a Russophobe or a neocon or a 'humanitarian' intervener intent on regime change in countries that resist American domination. 
This would include not only the usual victims, countries incapable of harming the United States militarily, but Russia and China as well. 
It is relevant too that the supposed lesser evil is a committed neoliberal and a Wall Street toady, and that Trump's 'crooked Hillary' taunts hit the target more often than not. 
These considerations, and others like them, should cause concern to those who are fine with lesser evil voting in general, but who think that there are thresholds beneath which lesser evil considerations should not apply. 
There is no need to agonize over these issues, however; not in this case. When Trump became the Republican nominee, lesser evil arguments became moot. 
This would still be the case even if more voters were not quite so willfully blind to the dangers inherent in Clinton's determination to maintain American world domination by any means necessary, and to her fondness for military 'solutions.' 
Lesser evil considerations are irrelevant because Trump is and always has been bound to lose to any Democrat, even to her. 
I have been pressing this point and its corollary 'î that anti-Trump hysteria is a distraction 'ì from Day One. As recently as a month ago, hardly anyone agreed with me. 
If only I had a dollar for every time I have been taken to task for not seeing the parallels between the Trump phenomenon and the rise of Nazism in the final years of the Weimar Republic! I would be a rich man today. 
But because it is now recognized that Trump's chances of becoming President are, for all practical purposes, nil, no one is pressing that line these days. I used to be out on a limb; I no longer am. 
It would be only natural to take pleasure in this turn of events, and I would 'î but for the fact that a Trump defeat implies a Clinton victory. That prospect is, at best, only slightly less nightmarish. 
Worse, it doesn't seem to matter that all but the most flagrant worrywarts now finally concede that there will never be a President Trump. Liberals and centrists and even a few foolish leftists are still going all out for Hillary. 
From the dead center to the soft left, the consensus view is still that now is a time to boost, not knock, Hillary's campaign 'î especially in the dozen or so states where the Electoral College outcomes could not have been determined years ago with absolute certainty. 
It is remarkable that so many people cannot let anti-Trump hysteria go; that they are so focused on Trump's misogyny, temperamental instability, and narcissistic blather that they don't see that the only thing we need fear, where Trump is concerned, is, so to speak, the fear itself. 
However, in Hillary's case, there really is something to fear: that she is about to become the Commander-in-Chief of the most lethal military force in the history of the world. 
On that point, her supporters are in denial, and even people who know better than to support her for her own sake remain determined to waste their votes by adding to her totals. Apparently, they think that this is a way to send the message that Trumpian 'fascism' shall not pass. 
How much better it would be if they would use their votes to build alternatives to the neoliberal perpetual war regime that Hillary and Bill and their co-thinkers have helped fashion! 
The best chance for that, at this point, is Jill Stein's campaign on the Green Party ticket. 
Stein cannot win, of course; a vote for her is only a protest vote. But there is nothing wrong with that. Hillary needs to know that she has no mandate to end the world 'as we know it,' and this is one of many ways to convey that message. 
Pundits who claim otherwise are dead wrong. Those who pile on for Hillary are wasting their votes; protest votes aimed at Hillary are not wasted at all. 
I would imagine that at least some Trump voters are thinking along similar lines. But the racism, nativism and Islamophobia of their candidate tarnishes the messages their votes will convey. They therefore cannot register with any real clarity. 
The message protest votes for Stein convey is, on the other hand, as clear and distinct as can be. 
And if she garners at least five percent of the total votes cast, the Greens will have access to federal funding in future elections, and will have a much easier time gaining ballot access in all fifty states. 
This would not make for much of a 'political revolution,' even in Bernie Sanders' highly attenuated sense of the term, but it would make future elections less mind-numbing and degrading, and it could ultimately lead to more far-reaching transformations of the political scene. 
Now that Trump has all but killed off the GOP, the duopoly party system is in jeopardy, and all kinds of political realignments have, at last, become feasible. *** 
I wasn't just being contrarian when I went out on a limb about Trump's chances; and my confidence was in no way based on inferences from polling data or statistical extrapolations. 
Let the blogosphere's 'political junkies' and the corporate media's talking heads knock themselves out with that. What they do is useful only for entertaining people who care about the horse race aspect of presidential elections. It is distressing how many Americans indulge in that spectator sport. Most of them are essentially apolitical. 
I was confident that I was right about Trump's chances because I knew that what people tell pollsters when an election seems far off is basically irrelevant for predicting the election's outcome. Information about how they and people like them voted in the past is more relevant, but not by much. 
This is especially true when, as in this case, disdain for one or the other candidate, or for both, is a dispositive factor in many voters' minds. 
I was also fairly sure that, rightly or wrongly, more people fear and loathe Trump than fear and loathe Hillary; and that, if they didn't at the outset, they would before long 'ì because Trump was all but certain to undermine himself, and because there is so much dirt out there on the Donald's sleazy connections and moral turpitude that even God-fearing Republicans, capable of believing almost any nonsense, were bound eventually to be repulsed. 
I suspected too that Trump never really wanted to be President; that he only got into the race to promote his brand, and because he is an egotist and publicity-hound. 
Trump hates to lose, however 'î especially to the likes of Hillary 'î and so, at some point, he must have decided to give the campaign his all, even if it meant bringing the Trump brand down with him. 
Should it come to that, I will shed crocodile tears for his brood, Ivanka especially. A worthwhile thing to do in the months ahead would be to work to make that happen; to do everything possible to assure that the damage done to all things Trump will be irreversible. What a delightful irony that would be! 
There are plenty of Hillary-haters in the Donald's base who hate Hillary because they consider her the embodiment of coercive goody-goodyism, or because they think she is disdainful of people like them (people in the 'deplorables' demographic), or because they think that she is too leftwing. 
The idea that she is too leftwing is nonsense, of course; she is not nearly leftwing enough. That anyone would think otherwise is a testament to the media's ability to shape public perceptions and to the degree of political ignorance rampant in some quarters of the American electorate. 
But 'vast rightwing conspiracy' Hillary-haters are spot on right about the rest of it 'î and two out of three isn't bad. 
Even so, there are better reasons than theirs to dread the prospect of a Clinton presidency. They all have to do with the service Hillary has done, and will go on doing, for the miscreants who control the commanding heights of America's and the world's capitalist order, and with her untrammeled, ideologically-driven bellicosity. 
Hillary knows how to game the system; and she and Bill know how to benefit from doing so. But, for all her vaunted 'experience,' she is clueless about the world. And although she and her fans boast of her 'pragmatism,' that woman is seriously inept. 
Most of what she undertakes to do is ill conceived, and nearly all of it turns out badly. 
In short, the lesser evil, if that is what she is, is a very great evil indeed. 
It won't take long, once she moves back into the White House and starts putting her stamp on the empire's depredations, for the scales to fall from the eyes of all but her most gullible supporters. 
I am even more sure of this than I was of Trump's defeat, but I will take even less joy in being proved right again. What lies ahead, with Hillary in control, is too horrible to contemplate.

Here is a list of the noteworthy, ongoing results of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq beginning in March 2003. (Recall that invasion was denounced by the UN as illegal, based entirely on lies, and'îgiven the U.S.'s hegemonic position in the world, allowing it to act with impunity'îthe crime's architects have never punished.) 
1/ The principal achievement of the war and occupation was the dramatic expansion of the al-Qaeda network that had attacked the U.S. on January 11, 2001. An al-Qaeda franchise was established in Iraq for the first time, playing a key role in the Sunni 'insurrection' against the occupiers and their Shiite allies, then expanding across the border into Syria where it split into the al-Nusra affiliate and its even more savage rival, ISIL. Iraq also served and serves as a training ground for jihadis now operating from Iraq to Libya and beyond. 
2/ The invasion and its consequences encouraged the cause of Kurdistan , an imagined state straddling Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. The Kurds are the largest stateless people in the world, victims of British and French colonialists who divided the region between them after World War I. After the Gulf War of 1991, the U.S. established a 'no-fly' zone over northern Iraq to discourage Baghdad from deploying troops in the region. Iraqi Kurdistan had already obtained a degree of autonomy before the invasion but the status became official under the occupation and a referendum for independence is likely to pass soon. This would infuriate Iraq and perhaps provoke Turkey's intervention. As it is, the autonomous region is locked in struggle with Baghdad over territorial claims and control over oil fields. 
3/ The invasion destroyed the Iraqi state , causing it to fracture into three: Kurdistan, the Sunni zone in the west, and the Shiite-majority areas around Baghdad. The Baathist regime of Saddam Hussein had been extremely repressive and brutal. But it had maintained order; discouraged religion in politics; protected the Christian and other religious minorities; promoted women's rights; imposed no dress code; enforced a criminal code modeled after the Napoleonic (not the Sharia); licensed rock n' roll radio stations, allowed the brewing of beer and its sale etc. The Shiite-led regime boosted into power by the occupation has reversed much of this. (A bill to ban the production and sale of beer was just passed by Parliament last week.) But the regime's power does not extend into much of Anbar Province, ISIL still governs Mosul, and again, Kurdistan has become autonomous. 
4/ Because Shiites are the majority in Iraq (60%), and dominate Iran next door; and because the leaders of Shiite parties have studied in Iran or lived their in exile and are sympathetic to Iran's mullah-led regime; and because the U.S. was forced by peaceful mass protests to allow elections and the emergence of Shiites as the leaders of the country, Iran's power and influence in the region has expanded dramatically. (Apparently no one in the State Department thought about that.) Since Iran has not attacked another country in centuries'îbut was savagely attacked by Saddam Hussein in 1981, sparking a long war killing over half a million people'îand since Iran's friendliness to its neighbor, one of the few Arab countries in which its co-coreligionists hold power, is entirely natural, one can ask why anyone might be alarmed by this. But it does alarm some, the leaders of Saudi Arabia, that crucial U.S. Arab ally governed by Wahhabi Sunnis, most of all. 
5/ The invasion produced a regional power struggle between Sunni Islamists on the one hand, and their Shiite (and other) enemies on the other. This is often portrayed as a contest between Saudi Arabia (whose government-backed clerics condemn Shiites as heretics, and who fear the prospects for rebellion in Saudi Arabia's own oppressed Shiite minority) and Iran, depicted as the protector of Shiites in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen etc. (The so-called 'Shiite Crescent' extending from Iran to Hizbollah-controlled areas of Lebanon in fact embraces states and movements that have little in common with the Islamic Republic of Iran. But they are all targeted by the medieval regime in Riyadh which tars them all with the Iranian brush.) The Saudis were keen advocates for a U.S. strike on Iran (on the false pretext of a nuclear threat); are major supporters of al-Nusra in Syria and have funded ISIL as well, preferring such Islamist forces to the secular if Alawite-led Syrian regime; and are bombing the hell out of Yemen with active U.S. and British assistance under the false pretext that the Shiite Houthi 'rebels' are agents for an expanding Iran. These things would not be happening, had the U.S. not ripped the lid off Pandora's box in Iraq in March 2003. 
6/ The invasion has produced friction between the U.S. and its important NATO ally Turkey (which has the second largest military in the alliance). Turkish war planes are bombing Kurdish YPG (People's Protection Units) militia in Syria who constitute the U.S.'s most reliable allies, producing U.S. protests (which the Turks ignore, arguing straight-faced that the YPG are just as terrorist as ISIL). The Turks warned before the invasion of Iraq that it would likely produce regional instability. But Ankara would have allowed the U.S. to attack from Turkish soil if Turkish forces as part of the 'coalition of the willing' could be stationed around Mosul, once part of Turkey'îthe idea being to contain Kurdish nationalism. 
Fortunately the parliament rejected the deal. But the predicted instability has occurred. The Arab Spring of 2011 in Syria was not directly connected to the Iraq invasion, but gave the U.S. the opportunity to pontificate that 'Assad has lost legitimacy,' demand his immediate resignation, and bankroll the armed opposition including the Kurds. The fact that U.S. efforts to find and recruit Syrian Arab forces as allies'îwho are not in bed with al-Nusra'îto topple Assad have failed so dismally binds the Pentagon ever closer to forces that Turkey wants to wipe out. (The conflict and contradiction are embarrassing to Washington. Oh, by the way, did you notice that the Turkish foreign minister just announced that Turkey would invade Iraq if it 'felt threatened'?) 
Having declared in 2011 that Bashar al-Assad must go, the U.S. was faced in 2014 with the horrible embarrassment of ISIL (that toxic fruit of its Iraq invasion) winning lightening victories from Raqqa to Fallujah, obliterating the Sykes-Picot line dividing Syria and Iraq. The now-Syria based terrorists were approaching Baghdad. So now the U.S. having withdrawn all troops in Iraq was back in action, bombing to prevent such a disaster. And it started bombing ISIL positions in Syria (although with far less efficacy than the later Russian efforts) in league with a list of largely reluctant allies dragooned into formal membership in what Washington likes to call a 'coalition' to make its unilateral program for the region sound like the will of what they like to call 'the international community' regardless of how many key nations that imagined 'community' includes. 
The U.S. command that Assad step down was made in the summer of 2011. Turkey's President Erdogan, hitherto a friend and even mentor of the Syrian leader, opportunistically took up the U.S. demand and demanded his resignation. And Ankara itself began to interfere big-time in the neighboring country it once dominated, targeting Kurds more than anyone else. Since the U.S. relies on these allies, how could there not be a sharp conflict here? 
7/ The invasion of Iraq and aftermath resulted in four million Iraqi refugees fleeing the country as of 2007. Hundreds of thousands have poured into Europe, alongside people displaced by U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Libya, and by the turmoil in Syria exacerbated by U.S. actions, producing a massive continent-wide crisis. Many Europeans aptly blame the deluge on the U.S., pointing to the U.S.'s paltry record of admitting refugees from the Middle East and complaining of strained national resources to handle the humanitarian catastrophe. (Another embarrassment.) *** 
This is all what Buddhists call 'karmic retribution' for past acts. Or what the Hebrew prophet Hosea referred to when he said 'Those who sow the wind reap the whirlwind.' Or what the CIA meant when it invented the term 'blowback.' It's all heading towards something, unless decent people stop it. 
But when I watch people like Michael Moore line up behind the foremost advocate of war in U.S. politics, joining (consciously, philosophical) amoral thugs hell-bent on maintaining and expanding the empire when it's in a stage of precipitous decline, I am not optimistic. Not only will she win, but she will rival Dick Cheney as a cold-blooded latter-day Cold Warrior, cynically exploiting fear and stupidity to try to bring Russia to its knees. 
Hillary doesn't recognize any of these seven points, which to recapitulate are: 
+ US actions have greatly strengthened al-Qaeda 
+ US actions have encouraged Kurdish nationalism (with unpredictable ramifications) 
+ The US through its vicious illegal actions has destroyed the modern Iraqi state 
+ US actions have solidified ties between Iran and Iraq's majority Shiite community, strengthening a country still targeted for 'regime change' 
+ The invasion of Iraq and the regime change there exacerbated the historical Sunni-Shiite divide, and encouraged Saudi Arabia as the ultra-Islamist protector of the shrines to redouble its efforts to support extremist Sunnis everywhere in the region 
+ The results of the invasion place Turkey and the U.S. at loggerheads over the question of Kurdish nationalist movements in both Iraq and Syria 
+ US interventions in the Middle East and North Africa since 2001 have produced a massive refugee crisis, inflicted mainly on Europe 
She does not acknowledge that George W. Bush's invasion (that she so passionately endorsed, fully exposing her Valkyrie soul, was criminal and not somebody's well-meaning 'mistake'). She doesn't have any analysis of the Kurdish question. (She is not'îas sometimes alleged by supporters'îa 'policy wonk' but a lazy intellect who doesn't know jack-shit about the real world.) 
She has never expressed regret for the horrific destruction of Iraq, nor given any attention to the plight of its women, who were (as she surely knows) much better off under Saddam Hussein. (To acknowledge that would be to suggest that sometimes U.S. imperialism favors misogynist Islamists over relatively progressive secularists, for its own pragmatic empire-building purposes. She can't mention that publicly.) 
She deals with the rise of Iran'îmade inevitable by the U.S. invasion of Iraq'îby doubling down on her crude clueless Iran rhetoric, which rests on the assumption'îrepeatedly debunked by U.S. intelligence agencies'îthat Iran might pose a nuclear weapons threat. She doesn't understand the history of the Sunni-Shiite divide; I believe she rolls her eyes in irritation that these people have these differences so hard to understand, impeding the Exceptional Nation's ability to straighten everything out by bombing, and conquering, and making people die. She doesn't understand anything about the history of the Kurds and their fate in the region. 
She feels no guilt at all about her orchestration of the ruin of Libya. She sees no reason to link her own actions to the flooding of Europe with refugees fleeing terror. But she will probably be the next president, with fellow shieldmaidens Michele Flournoy (as 'secretary of defense') and Victoria Nuland or Samantha Power (as secretary of state). 
Never acknowledging what happened yesterday, never able to absorb historical lessons, determined to maintain and expend its global hegemony (just as that becomes absolutely impossible to do, because other nations rise too, and great nations like Spain and Britain actually get humbled over time), the U.S. under Clinton will likely head methodically towards a showdown with Russia. She wants so badly, to show she can do it. She'll do it for women, everywhere, to show how strong a woman can be. 
And then there will be a sudden strange change in your environment. As you wonder what's going on you'll be painlessly vaporized, on account of Hillary's passion to topple Assad, or forcibly reintegrate the Donbass into Ukraine. 
The brilliance of the 2003 invasion will be clarified as never before in that bright blast, as Hillary'îa very strong woman'îcackles in the background from her bunker about how she came, saw, and a million died.

Three nights ago, 19.37 million television viewers watched the opening game of North American professional baseball's so-called World Series pitting the Chicago Cubs against the Cleveland Indians (the latter team won 6-0). I made it through the second inning before I had to switch to radio out of disgust at the Indians' jersey and ball-cap team logo 'ì a wild grinning Native American caricature best understood as a modern-day Red Sambo. It's bad enough that the Cleveland team retains (well into the 21 st century) the name 'the Indians.' First Nations people (the Canadian term) in the United States are more properly called Native or Indigenous Americans 'ì not a name imposed on them by white conquerors who mistakenly thought they'd 'discovered' 'the Indes. ' 
But the logo is really beyond the pale . Imagine a team called 'The Baltimore Blacks' or 'The New Jersey Negroes,' with a ball-cap showing a racist caricature of a 'Black Sambo.' Or imagine a German football (soccer) team named the 'Buchenwald Semites' 'ì or an Austrian team named the 'Vienna Hebrews' 'ì with a jersey bearing the crudely exaggerated caricature image of an old stereotypically hook-nosed Jewish man. That would be unthinkable in Holocaust-haunted Germany, of course. 
Native Americans suffered their own Holocaust on the lands that were swallowed up as the United States. By some estimates more than 15 million First Nations people inhabited North America (most of them on land later seized as U.S. territory) before Columbus. Thanks to white-imposed disease, displacement, eco-cide, and murder, the number of 'Indians' alive in the United States fell to less than 250,000 by 1890. But team names bearing images and/or names of Indigenous people who experienced genocide 'ì the Washington Redskins (yes, 'redskins,' which the Black comic Chris Rock once analogized to naming a team 'The New York Niggers'), the Cleveland Indians, the Atlanta Braves, the Chicago Blackhawks (named after a famous Sauk Nation warrior whose tribe members were butchered en masse by Andrew Jackson's U.S. Army), the Kansas City Chiefs, the Fighting Illini, the Florida State Seminoles, etc. 'ì live on with impunity in the U.S. 
Meanwhile, up in the northern Great Plains, predominantly white and heavily militarized local and state police are attacking the civil rights and bodies of Indigenous people fighting heroically to help humanity (including the mostly white folks watching the World Series) avert environmental catastrophe. The remarkable prayer, protest, and resistance camp set up by North Dakota's Standing Rock Sioux tribe is dedicated to blocking Energy Transfer Partner's eco-cidal Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). The pipeline is a 'giant black snake' being laid to carry 470,000 barrels of hydraulically fractured (fracked) crude oil daily from the North Dakota Bakken oil field under and near the Missouri River (under twice), the Mississippi (under once), and numerous other streams, lakes, rivers, and aquifers. 
The Standing Rock resistance camp has at various times in recent months swelled to accommodate more than five thousand 'water protectors' who are also air and climate protectors. It has garnered support and participation from more than 300 Native American tribes, making it the greatest example of inter-tribal solidarity in two centuries (since the time of Tecumseh) of U.S. history. And now 'ì behind the scenes of the World Series and the seemingly endless quadrennial presidential electoral extravaganza 'ì it is under vicious military-style attack. As Sarah Lazare reports on AlterNet : 
'Military-style checkpoints. Low-flying surveillance planes. Invasive strip searches. These are just some of the repression tactics that have targeted the thousands of Indigenous people and supporters who, heeding the call of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, mobilized to North Dakota to stop the'¶DAPL'¶On Saturday [October 22 nd ], 127 water protectors were arrested at a march by police in riot gear, some of whom carried assault rifles, and multiple reports of violence have emerged, including forced strip searches. 'What happened on Saturday was completely uncalled for, out of'îout of the realm of any understanding of people who are trying to do something good and right,' [said] Sacheen Seitcham, an organizer with the West Coast Women Warriors Media Cooperative'¶' 
The intrepid Native American journalist Brenda Norrell and other writers at Censored News report that Morton County (North Dakota) police are criminally torturing Native American activists, placing hoods over the heads of arrestees, water boarding hooded prisoners , and forcing at least one young woman to remain naked in jail cell for an entire night. 
Cody Hall of the Cheyanne River Indian Reservation in South Dakota told Lazre that 'Nobody is telling the real story of what's coming out of these camps, why we're doing this'¶Our overall goal,' Hall added, 'is that this pipeline is not built. Our overall goal is to protect people, protect the human race'¶We're protecting future generations.' 
Indeed, Earth scientists across the world are urgently warning humanity and the predominantly white economic and power elites who control global and U.S. energy policy that fossil fuels must be kept in the ground and replaced with renewable energy sources as a soon as possible if homo sapiens wants to avoid ever more imminent ecosystem collapse . 
It is a good moment for Americans of all races and ethnic and national origins to shift their attention away from the infantilizing mass spectator pageants of our corporate-mediated times 'ì be they 'World Series' games or quadrennial major party electoral carnivals. (You can put the game on the radio while organizing financial support for the Standing Rock water and climate protectors. And it takes about ten minutes to vote early, if you really think that matters ). It's a good time to glean some existentially imperative wisdom and inspiration from the likes of Cody Hall. Hall and thousands of other Indigenous water and climate protectors and their multiracial allies within and beyond North Dakota (mostly white Iowa activists have been waging an also-heroic and under-appreciated struggle against the DAPL at the Mississippi Stand camp in Southeastern Iowa ) are trying in their own highly focused way to draw a line in the soil of the Great Plains against petro-capitalism's relentless project of Greenhouse Gassing life on Earth to death 'ì a crime that will make the Nazis and Columbus look almost like amateur criminals . 
Cody Hall and Sacheen Seitcham and the many thousands of other Indigenous Americans fighting the DAPL are descended from the continent's original inhabitants. They are connected thereby to an Indigenous and pre-capitalist culture from whom Euro-Americans could learn a great deal. As the Native American author and activist Ward Churchill wrote two decades ago: 
'On'¶the day Christopher Columbus first washed up on a Caribbean beach, North America was long since endowed with an abundant and exceedingly complex cluster of civilizations. Having continuously occupied the continent for at least 50,000 years, the native inhabitants evidenced a total population of perhaps 15 million, cities as large as the 40,000-resident urban center at Cahokia (in present-day Illinois), highly advanced conceptions of architecture and engineering, spiritual traditions embodying equivalents to modern ecoscience, refined knowledge of pharmacology and holistic medicine, and highly sophisticated systems of governance, trade, and diplomacy. The traditional economies of the continent were primarily agricultural, based in environmentally sound farming procedures which originated well over half the vegetal foodstuffs now consumed by peoples the world over. By and large, the indigenous societies demonstrating such attainments were organized along extremely egalitarian lines, with real property held collectively and matrifocality a normative standard. War'¶in the Euro-derived sense in which the term is understood today, was unknown.' 
Also unknown was economic inequality and poverty on anything remotely like the scale of early modern Europe, which gestated the capitalist order that would spill its vicious surplus onto North American territory including what would become the United States 'ì a nation where the top tenth of the top One Percent currently owns nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. 
Pre-Conquest North American civilization was comprised of what Churchill described as 'large-scale societies which had perfected ways of organizing themselves into psychologically fulfilling wholes, experiencing very high standards of living, and still maintaining environmental harmony '¶' (W. Churchill, From a Native Son: Essays on Indigenism 1985-1995 , South End Press, 1996, emphasis added). 
Such were the remarkable, inter-connected social and cultural attainments of North Americans Indigenous people and nations, who are cruelly mocked as quaint and amusing savages from a bygone 'frontier' era in the names and logos worn by U.S. sports teams. 
As the top national media spectacle shifts from the World Series to the final days of the noxious Trump-Hillary election carnival, reflect on this great accomplishment of so-called Western Civilization: in the three 'presidential' 'debates' between the two widely hated major party contestants, the media moderators did not ask or relay a single, solitary question about climate change 'ì the single greatest issue of our or any time . Not one question . It is quite literally unreal. 
(And note the absurdity of North American white-capitalist-owned baseball's penultimate games being played during the evening and in the cool and even cold temperatures of the middle Fall season. Baseball is a summer game, meant to played in warmth, but commercial considerations dictate that profit trumps basic natural, Earth-conscious, environmentally grounded intelligence when it comes to when Major League Baseball and the all-powerful corporate media schedule the games. The continent's First Nations people would never be so foolish as that.) 
Meanwhile thousands of predominantly Native American activists (proud heirs of the people taunted and lampooned by the name and gear of the Cleveland baseball team). are giving their answer at the top of the U.S. heartland: fossil fuels must stay in the ground if our children and grandchildren and out other 'relatives' 'ì the other living things of the world 'ì are going to be able to enjoy a decent future. And for having the courage to draw this line in the sands of time and place, an untold number of these Indigenous heroes are now being strip-searched, caged, left naked in cells, hooded, and water-boarded (all these practices fall under the category of torture in the U.S. Army Manual) by militarized white police, heirs of those who committed the North American genocide.

Empty Declarations of Democracy'¶ Vacant Boasts of humanity 
For decades, Israel has held itself out as being the lone 'democracy' in the Middle East; a state where the rights of individuals could not and would not be held hostage to the autocratic whims of royalty, but rather a full partner to a free and robust electoral process that guarantees not just meaningful input from the governed but the ability to challenge state policies as the winds of change blow from 'the river to the sea.' 
Once again, recent events have proven this to be just so much a perverse myth'¶ empty rhetoric'¶ second only to the brazen unfounded Israeli boast of having the 'most humane army in the world,' even as the body count of Palestinian children grows in cemeteries and prisons that have become very much its own unique brand of 21 st century youth hostel. 
Recently, Hagai El-Ad , an Israeli and Jew, who serves as executive director of B'Tselem (The Israel Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories), spoke before the UN Security Council urging it to take immediate action against Israel's illegal settlements. 
Demagoguery and Inhumanity Exposed 
Not quite 1400 words in its entirety, one paragraph in particular of El-Ad's testimony sums up life for millions of those captured by a democracy that sees day as night'¶ pain as pleasure. Crushing, despite its brevity, the power and pain of these words could easily be part of an opening statement by a war crimes prosecutor at a tribunal called to hold Israel accountable for crimes unseen since the Nuremburg tribunals some 70 years ago. 
'What does it mean, in practical terms, to spend 49 years, a lifetime, under military rule? When violence breaks out, or when particular incidents attract global attention, you get a glimpse into certain aspects of life under occupation. But what about the rest of the time? What about the many 'ordinary' days of a 17,898-day-long occupation, which is still going strong? Living under military rule mostly means invisible, bureaucratic, daily, violence. It means living under an endless permit regime, which controls Palestinian life from cradle to grave: Israel controls the population registry; Israel controls work permits; Israel controls who can travel abroad 'ì and who cannot; Israel controls who can visit from abroad 'ì and who cannot; in some villages, Israel maintains lists of who can visit the village, or who is allowed to farm which fields. Permits can sometimes be denied; permits must always be renewed. Thus with every breath they take, Palestinians breathe in occupation. Make a wrong move, and you can lose your freedom of movement, your livelihood, or even the opportunity to marry and build a family with your beloved.' 
In a free democratic society these comments, while perhaps controversial, would certainly not constitute sedition. In an open, healthy State these words would surely give reason to pause and reflect'¶ but never serve as a rational trip-wire to strip their speaker of his birthright as an unbound citizen empowered to support his government for policies he finds just but condemn it for those that bear the star of tyranny. It is a distinction that Israel has failed to adopt or learn over the course of its 50 year subjugation of millions whose only crime is to be born Palestinian in occupied land with sign-posts everywhere that simply say ' Jews only.' 
Beating of Chests 
Not long after El-Ad's powerful speech before a world body entrusted with securing fundamental rights and liberty for all of its citizenry, the hue and cry could be heard among Israeli political elite to silence such subversive talk. Thus, Coalition Chairman MK David Bitan of the Likud Party undertook the first steps of reprisal by announcing he was considering submitting a bill to the Knesset that could remove the citizenship of Israelis who act against their country in international organizations. According to Bitan, 'El-Ad's actions at the Security Council are a blatant violation of the trust citizens must have for their country, so he should go find another country where he could be a citizen.' 
Alarming, one might ask; no, not at all'¶ merely another in an endless daily stream of steps by a government second to none when it comes to autocratic, indeed dictatorial, control of every fiber of its citizens freedoms, particularly their ability to access and exchange information without fear of retribution. 
Much is known and largely ignored about the thousands of Palestinian civilians that have been targeted and slaughtered by the Israeli military machine in occupied Palestine, whether in Gaza or the West Bank. Indeed, the killing fields of Gaza or execution alleys of back street Jerusalem no longer acquire more than a passing fancy or footnote in the evening news spread across a world now busy with outrages of more recent vintage. After 70 years of slaughter, it's just so much business as usual. 
So, too, we have seemingly become numbed to the reality that thousands of Palestinian political prisoners languish in isolation, many sitting year after year, some for decades, in administrative detention cells of political prisons'¶ uncharged, undefended and untried, tortured in ways that leave the spirits of those still roaming the now empty cellblocks of South Africa's notorious Robben Island relieved their misery was ended quickly through state sanctioned executions by 'suicide.' 
The Mighty Censor's Sword 
Closures of Palestinian news rooms and television stations are commonplace'¶ yet no more remarkable than assaults by Israel upon Palestinian journalists that long ago moved into triple digits and show no sign of abating. The Palestinian Centre for Development and Media Freedoms ( MADA ) has documented a pattern of such attacks by Israel running, for some time now, at almost 400 per year. Although the exact number of Palestinian journalists killed or injured by Israel over just the last decade may never be known, it has been documented that seventeen lost their lives in Gaza, alone, during the months of bombings which it endured in 2014. 
Dozens of Palestinian journalists and private bloggers have been arrested by Israel and held for violating vague administrative codes that typically come down to the application of entirely undefined prohibitions such as 'incitement.' Dareen Tatour , a 35-year-old poet and Arab-Palestinian citizen of Israel, was arrested and placed under administrative detention on charges of inciting violence via her poetry which she posted on Facebook and which merely praises those who fight against Israeli domination. Also arrested and charged with criminal incitement was 19-year-old Anas Khateeb , on the basis of her Facebook posts which included such alarming statements as 'Jerusalem is Arab,' and 'Long live the Intifada.' 
Recently, Palestinian journalist, Samah Dweik , was released from prison having served almost six months for an alleged incitement charge which resulted from comments about the occupation she posted on her private Facebook account. For most of her sentence, her family was banned from visiting or having any contact with her. She was but one of over 20 Palestinian journalists recently imprisoned by Israel for allegations of incitement, along with hundreds of other Palestinian activists or bloggers who have been targeted for arrest and prosecution for nothing more than postings of political opinions about the Israeli occupation and Palestinian resistance on social media. Dweik's release came not long after Israel and Facebook entered into an agreement to 'work together' to monitor Palestinian posts. 
The Sword Cuts Deeper 
Increasingly, Palestinians are not the sole victims of an Israeli policy to silence 'dissent' or to dramatically curb the nature and extent of information made available to its citizens'¶ Jews and Arabs alike. For example, not long ago, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman confronted the military station director after Army Radio broadcast a documentary on the life of the leading Palestinian national poet, Mahmoud Darwish , saying that material like Darwish's shouldn't darken Israeli airwaves. 
In what can only be described as a systematic effort to control both journalists and citizens in their ability to read and write, to access and exchange information, and to reach informed opinions essential to a public and democratic dialogue about current and future Israeli policies, its machinery of censorship has become the linchpin of the State's view of what is appropriate knowledge and speech and what is not. 
Thus, of late, Israel has begun to demand of social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter that they have input, if not control, over what posts ultimately find their way into the stream of ideas and debate within the Israeli public at large. According to Quds Press, Facebook and Twitter recently deleted thousands of posts, pages and accounts as a result of demands made by the Israeli Ministry of Justice based upon little more than amorphous claims that the information posed a threat to the safety of Israel. 
On an even more ominous note, the Knesset has begun to formulate legislation that would require foreign entities to actively monitor social media sites for information deemed to be offensive to Israel. Under the legislation, content based liability could be found for material published by foreign nationals, addressed to foreign nationals and posted on foreign websites thereby reducing the concept of free speech in Israel to one that is cast by the prevailing political winds of the day and little else. 
Recently the chief Israeli censor notified dozens of Israeli bloggers and social media activists that any material they might wish to publish in their personal blogs or social media accounts, when dealing with a wide range of what was described as 'security' related subject matters, must be vetted. Although provided a generic and ambiguous catalog of those areas to be submitted for clearance, the targets, themselves, were not permitted to disclose the makeup of the list under penalty of law. If history can be counted upon to be the guidepost of what subject matters must be prescreened before publication, in the past the list has included such security 'sensitive' subject matters as: 
+ Cooperation agreements with foreign militaries; 
+ Letters to the editor on military or security matters; 
+ Contacts with foreign countries; 
+ Anything connected to the nuclear industry; 
+ Information about official delegations abroad; 
+ Any material which constitutes a 'danger' to people's lives; 
+ Immigration policies from 'endangered' nations; 
+ Use of foreign sources or material that touch upon any of these areas; 
+ Detention of those suspected of security offenses; 
+ Any information about military industries; 
+ Appointments, resignations, firings, rumors about IDF activities or commanders 
Finally, in a readily transparent effort to maintain a democratic illusion of a free and uncensored flow of information in the market place of ideas, pursuant to the censorship regulations there are complete prohibitions against leaving any blank spaces or other potential indicators in one's writing or posts that might suggest or lead one to conclude that material has been deleted. 
For those disturbed over this censorship procedure, it must be remembered that we are, after all, talking about a state that recently placed 101st out of 179 countries in the press Freedom index worldwide. Indeed, this appalling placement for the Middle East's sole democracy is significantly better than Israel has scored in the Freedom index for quite a number of years. 
For those wondering just how widespread, indeed systemic, Israel's censorship procedures are, it is a country with a military censor procedure that has banned, outright, publication of, soon to be, some 2000 articles and redacted various information from 15,000 others in recent history. That is thousands of articles professional journalists and editors decided were of public interest but which never saw the light of day. Imagine how many more events of public interest went uninvestigated, or articles which were not written, issues debated, or challenges brought to bear for the Israeli body politic to consider because of self-censorship by journalists or editors too tired or principled to seek pre 'ì approval of their body of work by government censors. Stories simply swallowed up and disappeared by an industry of censorship. 
Human Rights'¶ Israel Wrongs 
Although not yet law, in what can only be described as an all-out onslaught against core democratic rights and values, over the last several days consideration of a bill has begun in the Knesset that would empower the Defense Minister to detain a citizen without trial; to deny one the right to pursue or obtain employment in a field of interest; to limit access to various public places; and 'to impose any other order or restriction necessitated by considerations of national security or public safety'. 
Earlier in January 2011, the Knesset endorsed a right-wing proposal to investigate some of Israel's best-known human rights organizations for 'delegitimizing' its military. Among others was B'Tselem. The proposed investigations would entail inquiries into the funding of several human rights groups that have a history of criticizing Israeli policies. At the time, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel described the proposal as a 'severe blow' to Israeli democracy and critics labeled the policy as ' McCarthyist '. 
Recently a variation on that bill became law in Israel compelling non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that receive more than half of their funding from foreign state entities to declare so publicly. Ultimately, the legislative criteria were tailored specifically to silence criticism of government policies by some 27 NGO's'¶ 25 of which, including B'Tselem, are considered to be left-wing'¶ while the other two are non-affiliated. As intended, the bill will have absolutely no impact upon right-wing and pro-settlement NGOs which are funded almost entirely by private donations from powerful Zionists and Zionist entities from outside of Israel. 
One can only imagine that upon returning home to the firestorm awaiting him, following his speech before the UN, Hagai El-Ad surely felt what it must have been like to be an activist leftist Jew in the United States during the dark days of McCarthy. 
On the other hand, perhaps El-Ad should consider himself very fortunate indeed. On his twitter account, Arab-Palestinian MK Ahmad Tibi mocked MK David Bitan's call for El-Ad's de-citizenship saying: 'Why stop at removing citizenship? Why not destroy the home of the B'Tselem director-general? Why not bar his entire family from entering the country, remove his land, submit them to administrative detention, and put checkpoints and closures in his neighborhood?'

+ Hillary Clinton is in no danger of losing the election and never has been. She could speak freely about the injustices being done to native people and native land in North Dakota. But she has remained 'comfortably dumb' about the Dakota Access Pipeline. Her silence indicates her true position, which we already know from the Wikileaks documents. Anyone who believes otherwise is, to use the Clinton team's own word, a 'loser.' 
+ HRC has already been endorsed as an eco heroine by every major green group in the country, which, naturally, means after taking office she can frack away with impunity. 
+ Yesterday, police culled from across North Dakota encircled the encampment of tribal people protesting the Dakota pipeline. Outfitted in military gear, armed with assault weapons and backed by armored personal carriers, drones and helicopters, the police raided the camp, firing concussion grenades into the crowds, dousing people with pepper spray, shooting them with rubber bullets, savagely beating people with police clubs (baton is too dainty of a word.) In all, more than 140 protesters were arrested on fallacious charges of criminal trespassing and rioting. The riot was all the doing of the cops and the pipeline company. Dozens of protesters were injured, some seriously. The raid continues this morning, as does Hillary's silence. 
Meanwhile, in a federal court-room in Portland, Oregon, the armed militants who seized the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge last year, held it for 48 days, threatened federal officials and local residents and did more than $6 million worth of damage to the site walked free, acquitted of all charges. 
Rarely have the hypocrisies of the American justice system been revealed more vividly. White privilege in action. 
+ The bosses of organized labor continue to disgrace themselves and their unions by their support of the pipeline company and its brutal tactics. This week Terry O'Sullivan, head of the Laborers' International Union of North America, lashed out at unions that opposed the pipeline, calling them 'bottom-feeders.' O'Sullivan also smeared tribal protesters as 'THUGS.' 
'The facts are on our side, yet in the past month, we have witnessed vocal opposition from groups, including some self-righteous unions, who know little about the project and have no job equity in it,' O'Sullivan wrote to his members. 'These unions have sided with THUGS against trade unionists. They are a group of bottom-feeding organizations that are once again trying to destroy our members' jobs.' 
Is it any wonder big labor is in decline? 
+ Do black lives matter to Black Lives Matter, Inc? 
The answer to that question probably depends on how you view DeRay Mckesson. Is the high profile activist the real power behind BLM or a self-anointed figurehead, angling for the spotlight? 
Regardless, Mckesson has now endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, a move which is as predictable as it is crippling for the movement with which he is aligned. 'Her platform signals both deep understanding of the challenges and a plan to move us forward,' McKesson wrote. 'When I met with her last week, it was clear that she now understands these issues well at a policy level and that she has researched the implications of the positions that she has proposed.' 
In exchange for a little face time with Hillary, Mckesson is willing to overlook or dismiss Clinton's description of black youths as 'super-predators,' her fanatical support for the racist Clinton Crime bill, her unapologetic backing of the awful welfare reform law pushed through Congress by her husband, her mercenary actions in Haiti, her bombings of brown and black people around the globe, her continued support for the death penalty as the rest of the nation finally turns against this vile form of punishment, her stubborn opposition to drug decriminalization and her constant hectoring about family values and personal responsibility, coded language for deprecations about the black family. 
The Clintons have long mastered the technique of capturing the support of those battered precincts of American society on which they have inflicted the most damage. They expect that black support is in the bag, that blacks, like environmentalists and Hispanics, have no where else to turn, that their leaders will intoxicated by the merest nod of recognition in the waiting line. They are assured that the displaced and oppressed will vote for Clinton regardless of her record Like so many other social justice groups before them, Black Lives Matter is treated by the Clinton machine as just another prop which they can manipulate almost at will for their political advantage. 
A Wikileaks document shows how this kind of stagecraft works in practice. On January 16 of this year, Jake Sullivan, one of Hillary's top advisors, emailed Hillary and John Podesta draft language for Hillary to apologize for her rancid description of young black men as 'super-predators.' This racist statement, which had never been retracted over the last 20 years, would have been fatal for nearly any other candidate. 
Here are the tepid words Sullivan proposed putting in Hillary's mouth: 
Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words. 
It's unfortunate because my life's work has been about lifting up children and young people who have been let down by the system or society. Kids who never got the chance they deserved, especially in African-American communities. We haven't done right by them. We need to. We need to replace the school to prison pipeline and replacing [sic] it with a school-to-college pipeline. 
As an advocate, as First Lady, as Senator, I was a champion for children. And my campaign for president is about breaking down the barriers that stand in the way of these kids, so that every one of them can live up to their God-given potential. 
Now that's pretty dull pablum and doesn't even approach being a real apology. But what's really interesting here is the timing. The non-apology apology was crafted on the 21st with the advance notice of a planned Black Lives Matter protest at Hillary's fundraiser on January 24th. The 'apology' is publicly released the next day, on the 25th, as if it were an organic response to the Black Lives Matter protest. All theater. 
As with climate change and economic inequality, the subject of racial justice in America has largely vanished from the scripts of Hillary's stump speeches, the platform, venerated by Mckesson, is already moldering away in some vault at the National Archives. Do black lives matter to Black Lives Matter, Inc.? Of course, they do. But they don't matter to Hillary Clinton and no one should believe for a moment that they do. 
+ Jake Sullivan, by the way, is married to Beltway insider Maggie Goodlander, who sharpened her knives as a speechwriter for Joe Lieberman and now toils as a 'senior advisor' to John McCain. Do you really think either Sullivan or Goodlander believe anything they write? 
+ HRC backs the coup in Honduras. The new junta begins jailing and killing workers, trade unionists, human rights activists and native people. State Department funds the slaughter. The Nation magazine and Michael Moore avert their eyes. 
+ If you ever feel the need to purge your lunch, no need to thrust your finger down your throat, just watch Michael Moore's latest film, Trumpland, where he slobbers all over photos of the young Hillary Clinton. 
Moore has been love with Hillary since the 1990s, but his once secret passion has suddenly erupted orgasmically on the screen. Trump's perv-talk with Billy Bush is less nauseating than Moore's vapid mewling about Hillary. 
Here are a few gems from Moore's embarrassing recent performance on MS-DNC's 'Hardball with Chris Matthews': 
'I'd rather Hillary be the nominee than Bernie.' 
'Hillary may not be [a socialist], but she's a Christian and that's the same thing.' 
'Hillary won't harm the children, she won't harm the planet.' 
Where's Charlton Heston when you need him? 
+ As far as he knows, Bill is still 'dicking bimbos' in Chappaqua and Hillary continues to blame him for advising her on how to shield her e-mails from the prying eyes of the press. But none of that matters. They are members of the same cult, baptized in the blood of Iraq. Thus Colin Powell endorsed Hillary for president this week, one lying war criminal saluting another. 
+ Tom Hayden, former SDS hotshot turned Clinton supporter, died this week. In Hayden's FBI file, J. Edgar Hoover instructed his agents: 'One of your prime objectives should be to neutralize him in the New Left movement.' In the end, Hayden neutralized himself. 
I was never a huge Tom Hayden fan. My allegiance was to the Panthers and the Yippies: Stew Albert, Judy Gumbo, Abbie and Anita Hoffman, Nancy Kershaw, all of whom became friends over the years. In fact, in our last conversation Hayden asked me 'why do you hate me so much?' This was just after his slavish endorsement of Hillary. That said, Jim Kavanagh , a former SDS organizer, recalls that Hayden did publicly confess his regrets about one of his most ignoble retreats, the one that led him into the arms of the Israel lobby‚Äìa mea culpa we ran on CounterPunch. 
+ Alexander Cockburn on Hayden, from the Village Voice in 1982: 'In the halls of the national gallery in Washington there are 46 portraits of Benedict Arnold. None look alike, yet they all resemble Tom Hayden.' 
+ The New York Times doesn't have a comics page. For laughs we have to turn to its editorials. This week we were treated to a real howler, Jonathan Rauch's essay on ' Why Hillary Needs to be Two-Faced ,' in which Rauch argues, laboriously, that Hillary needs to deceive the electorate in order to enact policies for the 'good' of the nation. But doesn't the moral measure for 'getting things done' depend entirely on who they're done to (the poor) and who they are done for (Wall Street)? 
+ Perhaps the decline in humaneness in politics is driven in part by a decline in the humanities in academia‚Ä¶ 
+ Oregon's self-styled 'progressive bisexual' governor, Kate Brown, has now endorsed the TPP. I think Congress pushes it through in the lame duck session after the election, though if the GOP had any brains, and it doesn't, they'd wait until after HRC takes office and force her to publicly lobby for its passage. 
+ Speaking of the Nanny State, 35% of the tax revenues from Oregon retail marijuana sales go toward funding‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. the police . 
+ California seems poised to legalize the sale and possession of marijuana. This move can't come soon enough. Even though the Golden State began decriminalizing the use of pot in 1998, there have been more than 500,000 marijuana-related arrests in California the last 10 years alone. 
+ Jeff Gerth is a former investigative journalist with the New York Times, who now writes for Pro Publica. Gerth has broken a lot of big stories in his career, including the Whitewater scandal, but his prose is so opaque and his narrative gifts so limited that few people have ever understood the import of his pieces, not even his editors. If a politician wanted to bury a scandal, all they really had to do was it leak it to Gerth, who would write it up in his muddled way and it would all be forgotten by the next morning. 
The Wikileaks emails have a fascinating back-and-forth between Gerth and Podesta about the Clinton Foundation. If the Clintons had any sense, they would have dumped the whole matter into Gerth's lap. Instead, Gerth writes Podesta to alert him to the fact that another reporter is onto the story: 
Are you aware of a forthcoming‚Äìin a few days‚Äìmassive examination of the Clinton Foundation by a conservative financial analyst? My understanding is that it raises questions about the foundation's financial reports and its shift into areas‚ÄìAIDS, for example‚Äìthat exceeded its original authorization from the IRS. I'm not writing anything about it but curious if you have heard anything? 
How Podesta's hopes must have wilted at that last sentence. 
+ Watching MSDNC talking heads, like Chris Hayes and Rachel Maddow, dismiss the latest Clinton Foundation scandals reminds me of the BP press team spinning Deepwater Horizon. 
+ Joe Biden was on MSDNC this week quoting the racist sociologist Charles 'Bell Curve' Murray favorably. Biden told Chris Matthews that he made 'my boys' take the quiz on white alienation in the back of Murray's rotten book, Coming Apart: the State of White America. Should we be surprised? As chief author of the Clinton crime bill, Biden transformed Murray's theories into vicious policies. 
+ Lyin' Hillary gets refreshingly honest for a moment: 'I'm proud to have the support of real billionaires.' 
+ Utah Rep. Chris Stewart compared Trump to Mussolini, and even though Trump falls a little short of the gold standard (i.e., Hitler), Stewart now says he's going to vote for the authoritarian mogul any way. 
+ Bernie Sanders says that he's prepared to be a liberal thorn in Hillary's side after she's election. Being a socialist thorn in her side, alas, would prove a little too prickly, I suppose. 
+ The Clinton campaign have shown Sanders no such consideration. Apparently, Clinton operatives have been stalking Sanders for much of the last two years. They even snapped a photo of Sanders sunbathing at an elite club in Martha's Vineyard. The photo was sent to John Podesta by former Bill Clinton aid Tina Flournoy. A few days later the campaign leaked the photo to gossip blogger Perez Hilton, who posted the photo on his site, quipping that Sanders was lounging after having raised Wall Street money for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. 
The Clintons wanted to embarrass Sanders, but it just proved that he has a pretty good body for his age. 
This is the same creepy tactic the Clinton campaign used against Obama in 2008, when they leaked a photo of Obama in traditional Somali garb. 

+ One state, under surveillance, divided by wealth, with liberty and justice for those who pay‚Ä¶ 
+ What's really driving the national debt? America's imperial boot print: $6 trillion and counting for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. With more than 800 military bases around the world, nearly half of the federal tax goes for military spending. Running out of enemies to fight? Wait a few minutes, we'll create some new ones. 
+ Clinton condemned Trump's critique of the US military strategy in Mosul as 'wrong' and 'dangerous.' For HRC, any criticism of US foreign policy is 'dangerous,' but not nearly as dangerous as the policy itself. 
+ Israel's politicians make Trump and Clinton seem almost sane by comparison. Check out the latest depraved boast from Israeli Defense Minister Avigidor Lieberman who announced, apropos of nothing, that Israel's next war on Gaza will be its last ' because we will completely destroy them .' 
+ NFL viewership is down, way down . Good. I've long thought that the sadistic joy NFL fans take from watching talented young black men inflicting brain damage on each other is an appalling metaphor for the dumbing down of American society. 
+ Fragment from a dream last night: HRC moves into White House, notices an empty space on the wall of the Oval Office. Turns to Huma. Points. 'Let's put Qaddafi's head there, shall we?'

Donald Trump most likely will not be elected President. Still, his historic campaign has sent shock waves through the American body politic. All are asking what it means and what it portends. The focus is on America at home rather than abroad. Foreign policy issues have been overshadowed by anxious domestic concerns. Moreover, Trump never formulated a coherent view of international issues. Like the average guy, he simply spat out whatever thoughts passed through his head as he had caught snippets of Fox news. Any attempt to discern logic and strategy from Trump's disjointed exclamations proves frustrating. 
Trump's entire campaign conveyed emotions rather than considered thoughts. It played to the public's feelings 'ì amplifying them and channeling them into a turbid brew of primitive slogans. Energy was imparted through unbridled vehemence and the showmanship of the born despot. So it is those emotions that we should look at to see what is simmering behind the formal fa√ßade of our democracy in action. For they will outlast the election. Therein lies their significance for possible effects on the United States relations with the rest of the world. 
If there is an appropriate label to stick on this fermenting vat, it is 'nativism.' By that we mean a rather inchoate mix of atavistic nationalism, xenophobia, aggressiveness, righteous religiosity and racism dressed up as patriotism. Deep-seated sense of grievance and pervasive feelings that the true American has been sold out provide the fuel. Each of these elements has precedents in American history and roots in American society. They periodically have surfaced in political movements from the 'Know-Nothings' who in the 1850s were empowered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by German and Irish Catholic immigrants, to the paranoia that accompanied the Red Scare in the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution and then reappeared with greater intensity in the form of McCarthyism. 
Today's manifestations have a larger economic component. The plight of salaried workers after decades of wealth redistribution upwards, the hollowing out of the country's industrial core, the financializing of business, and the emergence of a 'gig' economy that promises only more dislocation, insecurity, skimpy or no benefits, and declining living standards have eroded the optimistic creed that has been the lifeblood of America. Rugged individualism dictates that individual persons should assume responsibility for their failings; stoic fatalism in the face of external forces that drain all hope is quite another matter. 
Blame, like discontent, is free-floating. Its locus shifts among Wall Street, Government leaders, and foreigners. The last most interests us here. Factors originating beyond the nation's borders are prominent targets. They range from 'globalization' as an abstract new reality to Benedict Arnold companies that off-shore jobs and tax liabilities to American leaders who sign away American interests in one-sided trade deals to hostile governments who are cheaters. There is more than a grain of truth in the complaints directed at all of those mentioned. The 'common man,' as we quaintly used to call workers, indeed has been sold out by the 'bosses' 'ì economic and political. In truth, most of that selling out has been by elites favoring other elites here at home at the expense of the general populace. Foreigners are politically more convenient targets, though. 
The primary question is whether the disposition to blame external parties will manifest itself in antagonistic action. That has been the pattern elsewhere at other times. It is by no means obvious, though, that this logic holds in the case of the United States today. This is certainly true as regards any large-scale use of military force. Fifteen years of relentless, failed wars in the greater Middle East have drained the country of the passion for violence with which we retaliated for 9/11. Whether a President Clinton will expand operations in Syria is unaffected by what the American public's anger over illegal immigration or biased 'trade' agreements. A vague distaste for ungrateful, grasping foreigners does not eclipse aversion to expensive new adventures abroad or skepticism that they will work. 
As to Russia, the current high decibel condemnation of Moscow's alleged machinations is more an elite phenomenon, led by the security Establishment, than it is an expression of popular outrage. Few Americans identify with the Syrian 'rebels' whom Putin is fighting or Ukrainian para-militaries burning people alive in Odessa. The negative view of Russia, and Putin personally, so assiduously cultivated by politicos and the MSM does not translate into fear or hatred. The pervasive obsession with the Red Menace that marked the Cold War remains dormant. That is even true in Europe 'ì except for the Poles and the Baltics. Although that state of sentiment allows Washington to be rhetorically aggressive, and to take the much publicized steps of building up NATO forces around Russia's periphery. However, any action that is seen as actually raising a risk of direct conflict will be rejected. 
Conclusion : American policy toward Russia and the Middle East will follow the tracks laid down by the Obama administration with little deviation 'ì and no greater success. 
It is immigration that has been the hot button issue involving other countries. Passions are aroused by two things: the presence of millions of illegals from Mexico and Central America; and the prospect of Islamic terrorists entering the United States masquerading as refugees. The two merge at the most primitive level of emotions. Together, they deepen worries that the world is spinning out of control in ways that call into question the country they know (or imagine they know). Projections of rapidly increasing Latino populations which threaten to overwhelm school districts and voter rolls ruffle the feathers of many Middle Americans. Alarm that welfare and other social problems are siphoning off much needed public moneys in the age of austerity add a tangible economic element to these anxieties. 
Could this lead to implementation of the sorts of draconian 'ethnic cleansing' programs advocated by Donald Trump? Unlikely 'ì despite his ability to insert them into so-called 'mainstream' discourse about the problem. It is easy to exaggerate the extent and the intensity of anti-immigrant feelings. Most Americans encounter little of it in their daily lives. Those who do in places like Texas or California pretty much take it as a given: something that should be dealt with but not a matter requiring urgent action. Arizona is different. It's the extreme Rightists and the Republican politicos whom they have intimidated into obedience who make most of the noise. 
Foreign observers should note that the situation here is very different from that in Western Europe. Not only is the United States a very big country where relatively large populations can get lost but, equally important, social space is not as tightly configured. Outside of small towns, there is little sense of traditional community to be protected. Americanism trumps all as the successful integration of waves of immigrants throughout the country's history has demonstrated. While Latinos do present some unusual complications (unlike South or East Asian immigrants), visceral concerns about a denaturing of culture and society are relatively weak. (25% of all baseball players in the professional leagues are Latinos 'ì most from abroad). 
Conclusion : the politics of immigration policy reform has not changed. So, the policies and unresolved dispute over what to do next will remain in their present indeterminate state. 
The immigration-terrorism link is a far more passionate matter. It taps the terrorism psychosis that has gripped the country since 9/11. The graphic outbreak of mass violence over the past year has rekindled feverish emotions. The fact that the Orlando/San Bernadino/NY-NJ perpetrators had some vague connection with jihadi groups in the Middle East has given these events a transnational dimension. In fact, all of the perps were American-born citizens or had grown up in the US. Logically speaking, a detached observer could infer that restrictive immigration from the region or of Muslims generally would have no bearing on the level of terrorist threat. Facts in the age of Trump have lost much of their purchase on the American mind, though. 
One fact that is incontrovertible is that politicians run scared on all matters that are related to terrorism 'ì however oblique. The foot-dragging of President Obama on accepting any significant number of Syrian refugees is exhibit number one. Hostility toward Muslims generally is on the rise as witness the spike in abusive incidents in recent months. They now are occurring at a higher rate than they did in the wake of 9/11. By contrast, public authorities at all levels are less inclined to pursue surveillance and detention policies that skirt the law compared to that earlier period. 
The net effect will be a deepening perception around the world that the United States is hostile toward Islam. That is grist for the mill of the jihadis and opportunistic politicians. While it seems unlikely that signs of Islamo-phobia in American society will affect the thinking and actions of government leaders, they very well could register in the communities from which suicide bombers and terrorists are drawn 'ì in Europe especially and among certain unbalanced individuals in the United States itself. That cycle thereby gains velocity. 
What about the economic sphere? It is there that one might reasonably expect the preoccupations of the presidential campaign to affect the policy of a new administration. Economic nationalism follows naturally from aroused popular discontents that finger the forces of globalization as a prime cause of the economic plight in which tens of millions of American find themselves. That is to say, one might anticipate that American officials will take a more searching look at the 'bottom-line' impact of the accelerating integration of the world economy whose promotion has been a centerpiece of American foreign policy since the early 1990s 'ì as actively and optimistically promoted by HRC's husband. The process has tremendous momentum 'ì institutional (via the IMF, World Bank, EMU, mega-banks and MNS), political and intellectual. Economic thinking, academic and governmental, has been totally dominated by the twin market fundamentalist concepts of General Market Equilibrium Theory and benign globalization. While it has become trendy for all and sundry to make a ceremonial bow to the inequality phenomenon, it is hard to see the momentum of this juggernaut being blocked by disorganized displays of populism. 
Larry Summers personifies this state of affairs. One of the architects and master builders of the financialized, unregulated transnational economy who fought ruthlessly to bail out Wall Sreet at the expense of Main Street under Obama, he now punctuates his innumerable public appearances with warnings that we should attention to inequality dilemma. This homily is not a prelude to any action. Rather, it is akin to the Mafia don who devoutly crosses himself every time that his limousine crosses the path of a religious procession on a Saint's Day. 
That is the outlook in the United States under HRC. The one exception might by the TPP and TIIP treaties. Both were crafted by elites imbued by the optimistic globalization creed, both were kept secret except for the financial and commercial interests who were participants in their drafting, and both go far beyond traditional trade matters. The former, in particular, represents a radical transference of power from national governments to private parties institutionalized in expert panels heavily biased toward the latter. Indeed, many of its provisions may be unconstitutional 'ì as a fair-minded Supreme Court could rule. That recondite aspect of TPP did not get an airing during the campaign. However, the tying of the treaty to the damaging effects of 'trade' treaties forced even its supporters to equivocate. Hillary Clinton had been an enthusiastic backer until Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump began to reap political hay by condemning it. She now declares that is acceptable only if significant new conditions are met. 
What will be her ultimate position? She may be spared that agonizing decision were Obama able to push a lame-duck session of the Senate to ratify it. Otherwise, it may just be the one and only piece of American foreign relations that changes as a result of the election campaign. 
Continuity will prevail elsewhere. Americans overall will remain the insular, parochial, moralizing and largely ignorant citizens they have been. That leaves plenty of space for a foreign policy Establishment driven by a powerful inertia to add to its long string of mishaps. 
* Every society has its dark and dangerous undercurrents. America's is laced with racism and fed by a deep pool of personal insecurities. The recrudescence of coarse racism, the deep psychic anxieties of the white males of Middle America, the embrace of jingoism, the frustrations of trailer park super-patriots, and the desperation of tormented Evangelicals torn over the question of whether a prospective nuclear Iran is a sign that the End Days are approaching or a serious speed-bump on the road to Rapture 'ì together, these elements are creating an emotional maelstrom that has found an odd idol in the buffoonish persona of Donald Trump. The longer it lasts, the more attached he himself becomes to the pipe-dream of writing his name on the wind forever 'ì and the more his followers see themselves affirmed and exalted. 
Finally, we have to come to terms with the dismaying truth that public opinion, in individuals and in aggregate, is only exceptionally the outcome of an informed and thoughtful process of deliberation. It is the rationalist myth that we are by nature thinking creatures inclined to viewing the world around us in an emotionally detached, mature manner. Very, very few persons approximate that model. Inherited loyalties, deep seated prejudices and preferences, private emotions, the attraction or repulsion of personality 'ì all of these elements come into play to considerable degree. In today's society where attachments of all sorts are weak and evanescent, where political parties have little cohesion, where associational life has faded, where we are exposed to the barrage of media imagery and messaging, the rationalist model has become less and less valid. Most of us are shaped by influences that we only dimly perceive 'ì whether calculated intent lies behind them or not.

Global warming/climate change is one of the most potent agents of political and economic change in history. Its impact is like Atilla the Hun in modern times, who back in the day struck terror into the hearts of the Roman Empire. 
As of recent, Europe has been inundated with refugees from Middle Eastern wars as well as refugees from ecosystem collapse all across the southern Mediterranean region. The refugee impact is felt far and wide, including Brexit and a concomitant rise of xenophobia throughout the West whilst altering politics towards antagonism, hatred, and malevolence. The world is turning mad, and madness turns to madman leaders, like Attila the Hun. In point of fact, world history is filled with examples of madmen leading countries, ultimately to demise. They prey upon foreign threats of change to lifestyle and work to motivate people. Climate change is providing plenty of material to work with by displacing millions. 
Yet, the massive European immigrant problem of today is only a small taste of what the future holds as millions upon millions of people become climate refugees. It's an open question whether politics turn evermore ugly hate-filled as the world boils over with too much heat, too much sea, too much desertification, too much drought, too much friction. 
Recently, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development committed to America's first ever grant for climate refugees, allocating $48 million for Isle de Jean Charles in southeastern Louisiana out of total grants of $1 billion for 13 states to build levees, dams, and drainage systems to fight back against anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change. 
Isle de Jean Charles is the first allocation of federal tax dollars to move an entire community of climate refugees. In the 1950s the isle was 11 miles long by 5 miles wide. Today, it is a quarter/mile wide by 2 miles long. The community must move to higher ground. 
According to Marine Franck of the UN's refugee agency, 'One person is displaced every second by a natural disaster. The numbers are huge,' (Amy Lieberman, Where Will the Climate Refugees Go? Aljazeera, Dec. 22, 2015). 
Climate refugees are becoming a worldwide phenomenon of epic proportions, e.g., 200,000 Bangladeshis become homeless every year due to erosion. Globally, 'desertification'îclimate change-triggered degradation of land ecosystems'îmight, in a decade, create 50 million refugees, the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD), a global initiative led by 30 different research groups, warned in a new study'¶.' (Avaneesh Pandey, Land Degradation, Desertification Might Create 50 Million Climate Refuges Within A Decade, International Business Times, Sept. 15, 2015). 
The operative question is: Where will 50 million refugees go over the next 10 years? Will they roam the countryside, similar to bands of medieval wanderers that raided castle fortifications? Back in the day, they learned to scale walls, which only serve to entice outsiders, knowing something of value must be stored inside. 
Rampant drought is believed to have played a role in Syria's civil war. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences claims unprecedented drought in Syria between 2007-2010 triggered an exodus of 1.5 million farmers to cities in search of food and work, a contributing factor to the civil war as these restless able-bodied met a mean-spirited, heartless fate. 
'Climatologists say Syria is a grim preview of what could be in store for the larger Middle East, the Mediterranean and other parts of the world'¶ The Fertile Crescent'îthe birthplace of agriculture some 12,000 years ago'î is drying out' (John Wendle, The Ominous Story of Syria's Climate Refugees, Scientific American, Dec. 17, 2015). When interviewed, Syrian refugees in a Turkish camp spoke of the horrendous drought conditions that fueled social turmoil leading to civil war. 
According to Dr. James Hansen (Columbia University), heat waves and drought conditions worldwide are more than three standard deviations outside of the norm, or looked at another way, 50 years ago such anomalies only covered 0.02% of land area. Now, because of global warming, the anomalies cover 10% or an increase of 50 times in 50 years. This exponential growth will ultimately serve to pressure massive movements of climate refugees, likely fostering pockets of war zones spreading like infectious diseases. 
In China, which is now 20% desert, spreading at the rate of 1,300 square miles annually, three deserts are merging into one vast sea of sand. Recently, because of creeping desertification, the Chinese government relocated 30,000 people referred to as 'ecological migrants,' (Josh Haner, et al, Living in China's Expanding Deserts, New York Times, October 23, 2016). 
In America, climate refugees are on the move, but they are not yet smack dab in the public eye. In Newtok, Alaska, the highest point in town, the school building, will be under water in 2017. Climate change is not just hotter temperatures for the residents of Alaska, it is happening under their feet as shoreline erosion is forcing the entire community to move inland. 'In Alaska alone, climate change flooding and shoreline erosion already affects more than 180 villages,' (Victoria Herrmann, America's Climate Refugee Crisis Has Already Begun, The LA Times, January 25, 2016). 
In the years to come, thousands upon thousands from along America's most fragile shorelines will embark on a great migration inland. In the Chesapeake Bay, Tangier Island's shoreline recedes by 14 feet per year. On Washington's Olympic Peninsula, the Quinault Nation relies upon a 2,000-foot seawall to hold water until they move uphill. In North Carolina's Outer Bank with its 50,000 permanent residents, portions of the island complex are down to 25% original width. Miami Beach is physically raising roadways because of persistent high water. 
As it happens, America's climate refugee problem is only starting, but it is very real and likely a political tinderbox as Americans register sourpuss displeasure with any kind of migrant behavior evidenced by support for political candidates like Donald Trump, who uses the hopelessness of the forlorn as political fodder, eerily similar to Attila the Hun's rise to power. On a purely political basis, immigrant finger-pointing pays off in votes for candidates who offer solutions to the invasion of 'others' that threaten constituent jobs and lifestyle. 
Germany provides a window to how migrant issues influence politics. 'A year after German Chancellor Angela Merkel opened Germany's doors to tens of thousands of refugees'¶ she's fighting for her political life. Her popularity has sunk to a five-year low. The far right is ascendant,' (Paul Hockenos, The Political Price of Merkel's Migrant Policy, The Atlantic, Sept. 14, 2016). 
Meanwhile, Austria militarized its borders. 
People Up In Arms is how migrants are met at some foreign shores. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n said he will tour European capitals to recruit allies for his 'war against Brussels' and the Union's pro-migrant policies as 'people in Brussels are 'plotting to move and settle these aliens among us as soon as possible,' (Viktor Orb√°n's Speech: War Against the World, Hungarian Spectrum.org, March 16, 2016). 
'Where will 50 million climate refugees go over the next 10 years' is a fair question to ponder, but what if the scientists that predict rising seas and devastating droughts are too conservative, and what if global warming is already way ahead of the science, as some scientists believe true, will 200 or 500 million climate refugees seek shelter and food, or how about one billion? 
The politics surrounding the climate refugee issues too often come to surface dressed in warriors' garb. 'When the Pentagon begins to think about what might happen, that's a clear indication that we have to start taking something seriously,' is the forewarning mentioned in the award-winning documentary Climate Refugees (2010) ( watch the trailer here ). 
Never before in American political history has an election carried as much weight for the prospects for the climate as the current presidential election in America. The issue of climate change front and center is a non-issue, a dead issue. However, Trump will reverse any and all progress made by the federal government, including disruption of the Paris Agreement of 2015, if at all possible. That message would be a devastating blow to worldwide efforts to control climate change. 
Meanwhile, the climate refugee conundrum will turn very ugly much more quickly.

The last time Alabama played God, executing death row inmate Christopher Brooks by lethal injection on January 21, 2016, The Montgomery Advertiser and al.com published a column of mine in which I wrote: 'Initial reports out of Alabama are that the execution went as 'smoothly' as killing a reasonably healthy 43-year-old man can go. In any event, it appears there was no visible evidence Brooks suffered bodily distress as the lethal drugs were administered, prompting Alabama Prison Commissioner Jeff Dunn to say that the execution with the controversial sedative drug midazolam 'went exactly as planned[.]' ( See ' Executions are hardly an exact science ,' on February 8, 2016, and ' Courts denied phone to attorneys of man condemned to death ,' on February 9, 2016). 
Boy, was I wrong. I was wrong just like Commissioner Dunn, and every media representative and Alabama law enforcement official in attendance was wrong 'ì for painting Mr. Brooks' execution as a peaceful passing, like he just curled up in a comfy hammock and dozed off 'ì never to wake again. 
In a federal court filing on April 15, 2016, that has been inexplicably unreported in the media, Mr. Brooks' federal defenders, who additionally represent Ronald Bert Smith (scheduled for execution on December 8), allege that after Mr. Brooks was injected with the controversial drug midazolam 'ì the first in Alabama's three-drug execution cocktail which is supposed to anesthetize the prisoner so that they are 'insensate' (completely lacking any physical sensation) 'ì a witness to Brooks' execution, a federal investigator, Ms. Terri Deep, saw that 'Mr. Brooks' left eye opened after the consciousness assessment and, assuming they even noticed, no one from the ADOC [Alabama Department of Corrections] took any action.' 
The filing further alleges that: (1) '[t]he fact that Mr. Brooks' eye opened indicates he was feeling sensation contemporaneous with, or prior to, injection of the paralytic. Therefore, he was sensate at the time he was executed by injection of potassium chloride,' (2) '[t]he final drug, potassium chloride, disrupts the normal electrical activity of the heart and induces cardiac arrest by stopping the heart from pumping blood. Potassium chloride traveling in the blood stream from the site of injection towards the heart causes an extreme burning sensation as it moves through the body destroying the internal organs,' and (3) in the event the inmate is not properly anesthetized, 'potassium chloride will cause excruciating pain' (citing a 2016 report by the National Institutes of Health). 
In ' The death penalty in Alabama: What's it really like ?,' published by The Montgomery Advertise r in April, I discussed in graphic detail what it means when lethal drugs are administered to a condemned person who is not 'insensate,' a word commonly used in the death penalty context to, as the Supreme Court put it, 'eliminate any meaningful risk that a prisoner would experience pain from the subsequent injections' ( Baze v. Rees , 553 U.S. 35, 49 (2008)). 
I wrote: 
'That first drug is supposed to put you down, painlessly, like a dog 'ì your eyes just close and you 'go to sleep' forever. Except often, it don't work like that.

Attached to their filing pending before The Honorable Chief District Judge W.

Alabama's Attorney General's office, beleaguered Governor Robert Bentley, and ADOC have not, to this date, offered any substantive response to the federal defenders' claims about what now appears to be yet another shameful example of a botched U.S. execution 'ì in which a death row inmate was forced to suffer cruel and unusual punishment 'ì in the name of justice. 
Tommy Arthur's execution in Alabama, scheduled for November 3, will mimic Mr. Brooks' gruesome demise if allowed to proceed. Ronald Bert Smith's execution date follows closely after on December 8. Will the people of Alabama allow these executions to go forward in their name, or will they, in the name of all that is good, and all that is right, demand that Governor Bentley immediately declare a halt to all state executions?

TJC: Please tell us about your new film, The Coming War on China . 
JP: The Coming War on China is my 60th film and perhaps one of the most urgent. It continues the theme of illuminating the imposition of great power behind a facade of propaganda as news. In 2011, President Obama announced a 'pivot to Asia' of US forces: almost two-thirds of American naval power would be transferred to Asia and the Pacific by 2020. 
The undeclared rationale for this was the 'threat' from China, by some measure now the greatest economic power. The Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, says US policy is to confront those 'who see America's dominance and want to take that away from us'. 
The film examines power in both countries and how nuclear weapons, in American eyes, are the bedrock of its dominance. In its first 'chapter', the film reveals how most of the population of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific were unwittingly made into nuclear guinea pigs in a programme whose secrets 'ì and astonishing archive 'ì are related to the presence of a missile base now targeting China. The Coming War on China will be released in cinemas in the UK on December 1st and broadcast on ITV (in the UK) on December 6th. 
TJC: How do you assess Australia's role in America's 'Pivot to Asia'? 
JP: Australia is virtually the 51st state of the US. Although China is Australia's biggest trader, on which much of the national economy relies, 'confronting China' is the diktat from Washington. The Australian political establishment, especially the military and intelligence agencies, are fully integrated into what is known as the 'alliance', along with the dominant Murdoch media. I often feel a certain sadness about the way my own country 'ì with all its resources and opportunities 'ì seems locked into such an unnecessary, dangerous obsequious role in the world. If the 'pivot' proceeds, Australia could find itself fighting, yet again, a great power's war. 
TJC: With regards to the British and American media, how can the US get away with selling China as a threat when it is encircling China? 
JP: That's a question that goes to the heart of modern-day propaganda. China is encircled by a 'noose' of some 400 US bases, yet the news has ignored this while concentrating on the 'threat' of China building airstrips on disputed islets in the South China Sea, clearly as a defence to a US Navy blockade. 
TJC: Obama's visit to Japan, and particularly to Hiroshima, was a really cynical act. What was your impression of Japan and the political situation there? 
JP: Japan is an American colony in all but name 'ì certainly in terms of its relationship with the rest of the world and especially China. The historian Bruce Cumings explores this in an interview in the film. Within the constraints of American dominance, indeed undeterred by Washington, Japan's current prime minister Shinzo Abe has developed an extreme nationalist position, in which contrition for Japanese actions in the Second World War is anathema and the post-war 'peace constitution' is likely to be changed. 
Abe has gone as far as boasting that Japan will use nuclear weapons if it wants. In any US conflict with China, Japan 'ì which last year announced its biggest ever 'defence' budget 'ì would play a critical role. There are 32 US military installations on the Japanese island of Okinawa, facing China. However, there is a sense in modern Asia that power in the world has indeed moved east and peaceful 'Asian solutions' to regional animosities are possible. 
TJC: Do you think the new trade and investment deals like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and especially the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) will affect China's business operations? 
JP: It's difficult to say, but I doubt it. What is remarkable about the rise of China is the way it has built, almost in the blink of an eye, a trade, investment and banking structure that rivals that of the Bretton Woods institutions. Unknown to many of us, China is developing its 'New Silk Road' to Europe at an astonishing pace. China's response to threats from Washington is a diplomacy that's tied to this development, and which includes a burgeoning alliance with Russia.

Class warfare is poised to reach a new milestone as this year's combined total of dividends and stock buybacks by 500 of the world's largest corporations will exceed US$1 trillion. 
So large is that figure that, for the second year in a row, the companies comprising the S&P 500 Index (a list of many of the world's biggest corporations) will pay out more money in dividends and stock buybacks than the total of their profits. Yes, times are indeed good for speculators. Not so good for employees 'î you know, the people who do the actual work 'î whose pay is stagnant or declining so that those at the top can scoop up still more. 
Although dividends, a quarterly payment to holders of stock, are steadily increasing, the increase in stock buybacks has been steeper. The total of these has tripled since 2009 as financiers and industrialists feverishly extract as much wealth as they can. This is part of why the 'recovery' since the 2008 economic collapse has been a recovery only for those at the top. 
In short, a buyback is when a corporation buys its own stock from its shareholders at a premium to the current price. Speculators love buybacks because it means extra profits for them. Corporate executives love them because, with fewer shares outstanding following a buyback program, their company's 'earnings per share' figure will rise for the same net income, making them look good in the eyes of Wall Street. Remaining shareholders love buybacks because the profits will now be shared among fewer shareholders. 
Wall Street and corporate executives both win! Hurrah! Who could by hurt by this? Oh, yes, the employees. They'll have to suffer through pay freezes, work speedups and layoffs because the money shoveled into executive pay and financial industry profits has to come from somewhere. This sort of activity helps buoy stock prices. So does the trillions of dollars the world's central banks have printed to sustain their 'quantitative easing' programs. 
We're not talking loose change here. The U.S. Federal Reserve pumped $4.1 trillion into its three rounds of quantitative easing; the Bank of England spent ¬£375 billion; the European Central Bank has spent about ‚Ç¨1.34 trillion; and the Bank of Japan has spent ¬•220 trillion so far. That's a total of US$8 trillion or ‚Ç¨7.4 trillion. And the last two programs are ongoing. 
Encouraging investment or inflating bubbles? 
The supposed purpose of quantitative-easing programs is to stimulate the economy by encouraging investment. Under this theory, a reduction in long-term interest rates would encourage working people to buy or refinance homes; encourage businesses to invest because they could borrow cheaply; and push down the value of the currency, thereby boosting exports by making locally made products more competitive. 
In actuality, quantitative-easing programs cause the interest rates on bonds to fall because a central bank buying bonds in bulk significantly increases demand for them, enabling bond sellers to offer lower interest rates. Seeking assets with a better potential payoff, speculators buy stock instead, driving up stock prices and inflating a stock-market bubble. Money not used in speculation ends up parked in bank coffers, boosting bank profits, or is borrowed by businesses to buy back more of their stock, another method of driving up stock prices without making any investments. 
The practical effects of all this is to re-distribute income upward . That is the raison d'√™tre of the financial industry. 
What else could be done with the vast sums of money thrown at the financial industry? In the U.S. alone, home to a steadily crumbling infrastructure, the money needed to eliminate all student debt, fix all schools, rebuild aging water and sewer systems, clean up contaminated industrial sites and repair dams is estimated to be $3.4 trillion 'î in other words, $700 billion less than the Federal Reserve spent on its quantitative-easing program. 
The British think tank Policy Exchange estimates Britain's needs for investment in transportation, communication and water infrastructure to be a minimum of ¬£170 billion, or less than half of what the Bank of England spent on its QE scheme. 
Borrowing to give more to speculators 
To return to the $1 trillion in dividends and buybacks, a research report by Barclays estimates that those payouts by S&P 500 corporations will total about $115 billion more than their combined net income. As a Zero Hedge analysis puts it: 
'[C]ompanies will promptly send every single dollar in cash they create back to their shareholders, and then use up an additional $115 billion from cash on the balance sheet, sell equity or issue new debt, to fund the difference.' 
Near-zero interest rates, another central bank policy that favors the financial industry, have enabled this accumulation of debt. Debt not for investment, but simply to shovel more money into the pockets of financiers and executives. But debt can't increase forever, and someday, perhaps in the not too distant future, central banks will raise interest rates, making debt much less attractive. The Barclays report calculates that 2015 also saw buybacks and dividends total more than net income; the last time there was consecutive years in which this happened were 2007 and 2008. 
It would of course be too simplistic to interpret this metric as a signal that an economic collapse on the scale of 2008 is imminent, but is perhaps a sign that the latest stock market bubble may be close to bursting. 
Another signal that trouble may be looming is that money is now being shoveled into bonds, a sign that confidence in the stock market is waning. A New York Times report suggests that European and Asian investors (the Times of course is much too genteel to use the word 'speculator') are pouring so much capital into U.S. bond markets that a bubble is being inflated there as well. These speculators are seeking higher returns from bonds floated by U.S. corporations than they can get at home. The Times reports : 
'The surge in flows echoes a wave of investment in the years right before the financial crisis, when mostly European investors snapped up billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities before the American housing market imploded. 
The current numbers are also arresting. According to [former Treasury Department official Brad W.] Setser's figures, about $750 billion of private money has poured into the United States in the last two years alone.' 
Starved for investment 
Setting aside the touch of xenophobia in it, the Times report does at least broach the subject of under-investment. And wealthy investors possessing far more money than can possibly be invested is hardly an unknown phenomenon. As an example, let us examine Wal-Mart, which racked up more than $16 billion in net income for 2015 and seems poised to better that this year. 
The Walton family, heirs to founder Sam Walton, owns about half of Wal-Mart's stock and receive a corresponding share of the billions of dollars in dividends the company pays yearly. It also spends billions more buying back stock annually, an indirect help to the Waltons. This is a company notorious for dodging taxes while paying its employees so little they require government assistance, and is the recipient of vast amounts of government handouts . 
The Waltons make tens of thousands times what their ill-paid employees earn. They certainly don't work tens of thousands harder 'î or even work at all, as the billions roll in just for being born into the right family. Wan-Mart is far from alone, but does provide an exemplary example of class warfare. An estimated $1 trillion a year goes to corporate profits that once went to wages, according to a PBS Newshour report. 
The harder you work, the more the boss, and financiers, make. What sort of system is this?

Wallonia is not alone. Not only has the region been joined by several other Belgian regional parliaments in opposition to CETA (the Canada-EU Comprehensive and Economic Trade Agreement), but now a Canadian constitutional challenge against CETA has been launched in the Federal Court of Canada. 
On Oct. 21, renowned constitutional lawyer Rocco Galati filed the statement of claim against CETA on behalf of the Hon. Paul Hellyer (former Minister of National Defence) and two co-plaintiffs, Ann Emmett and George Cromwell (members of the Committee on Monetary and Economic Reform). At the Oct. 25 press conference, Galati referred to the corporate sector as 'the new royalty,' and he stated, 'What this treaty does is literally revert us back to the divine right of kings, but they are multinational corporations now.' 
Galati's statement of claim argues that CETA is unconstitutional for several reasons, including the fact that it was never given Canadian Parliamentary approval, while 'the treaty places the rights of private foreign investors over those of the Canadian Constitution and Canadian citizens.' 
Critics on both sides of the Atlantic maintain that massive trade deals like CETA give far too much power to corporations at the expense of citizens and governments, especially through the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism 'ì or the 'investor court system' (ICS) as it was rebranded in CETA 'ì that allows foreign corporations to sue governments (in a private court system) over policy decisions or regulations that harm their future profits. [1] Across the planet, national governments have been sued for billions of dollars by companies claiming 'lost future profits' because of regulatory decisions. Walloons (and Europeans in general) have been consistently critical of ISDS tribunals for private arbitration. 
'It's ironic that everybody is dumping on the Walloons,' Galati told The Canadian Press in advance of his Oct. 25 press conference. 'They have a very similar constitution to ours except they're respecting theirs. So I don't know why they're being criticized for respecting their constitution.' [2] 
Because of continued opposition by Belgian regional governments, the scheduled Oct. 27 formal signing of CETA at a summit in Brussels was cancelled at the last moment on Oct. 26. Wallonia's minister-president Paul Magnette has stated, 'We are not against a treaty with Canada. But we won't have one that jeopardizes social and environmental standards and the protection of public services and we want absolutely no private arbitration [ISDS] mechanisms.' [3] 
Galati's statement of claim similarly warns that various articles of CETA 'over-ride Charter guarantees that ground Canada's ability to mount public programs on Health, Education, Social Services and public utilities including the elimination of subsidies, monopolies, and state enterprises for the public welfare.' As Galati put it during the press conference, the only Canadian public services and entities protected in CETA are 'tax collection, national security, and cultural industries,' he said. 'Everything else is up for grabs' for privatization. As well, CETA encroaches on 'exclusive Provincial spheres of jurisdiction' and 'guts and extinguishes the constitutionally protected Judiciary in Canada by creating foreign tribunals' for ISDS arbitration. 
The Canadian Press asked International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland whether CETA meets the requirements of Canada's Constitution and she replied, 'Absolutely.' At his press conference the following day, Galati said that 'the Trade Minister's elaborate response 'ì 'Absolutely' 'ì doesn't cut it for me.' 
Galati also referred to 'residual Crown prerogative' 'ì the belief that the Prime Minister of Canada can sign a treaty without Parliamentary debate and voting 'ì and said, 'The federal court has already decided that this notion is a serious question to be resolved.' 
The constitutionality of CETA is also being challenged in German courts. [4] 
The statement of claim gives the Canadian government 30 days to respond, and it also seeks interim injunctions to prevent the federal government from signing, ratifying and implementing CETA. 
During the House of Commons question period on Oct. 26, Canadian Green Party Leader Elizabeth May asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau if he was willing to change or jettison the controversial investor-protection section of CETA in order to save the trade deal. Trudeau declined, calling CETA 'gold-plated,' and said, 'We are confident that in the coming days we will see a positive outcome for this historic deal.' [5] Hours later, the Brussels summit was cancelled indefinitely. 
Trudeau, Freeland, and Canadian foreign affairs minister Stephane Dion had been part of a delegation scheduled to meet with EU leaders Donald Tusk and Jean Claude Juncker yesterday, but the trip was cancelled as 'crisis talks' in Belgium continue. [6] While some CETA proponents maintain that a new signing summit could happen within days, Magnette has also said, 'This treaty affects the lives of 500 million Europeans and 35 million Canadians for years and years. We can take a few weeks, a few months to analyze the problems and overcome them.' [7] 
Freeland's Theatrics 
Magnette's statement raises the question of why the rush to approve CETA? The answer for many is that the longer the delay, the more people (especially in North America) will find out about the ISDS clauses and the actual contents of the massive trade deals similar to CETA 'ì the TransPacific Partnership (TPP), the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) 'ì and as a result, shift their opinion about these deals. 
In other words, the rush to approve CETA isn't really about the so-called 'credibility' of the EU to sign an agreement, as Trade Minister Freeland and others maintain. The rush is about the undesirability of the deals themselves 'ì which are unravelling as more people learn what's in them. 
On Oct. 21, Freeland walked out of talks with Magnette and ('appearing to hold back tears') told the waiting press that the EU is not capable of making an international agreement, 'even with a country with European values such as Canada, even with a country as nice and patient as Canada.' [8] 
But as Canadian law professor (and former Member of Parliament) Craig Scott recently wrote, 'In the last week, Freeland's focus on her own disappointment and efforts has projected a sense of a noble mission fallen short due to Europe's spurning of a country sharing its progressive values'¶Freeland, holding back tears, went so far as to castigate Europeans for failure to do a deal with 'nice' Canada. This is all very rich. Based on a European negotiator's briefing to [New Democratic Party Members of Parliament] during CETA negotiations (the Harper government refused to brief MPs), it was Canada that insisted on some of the most regressive and dangerous provisions in CETA. The provisions in question were 'ì and still are 'ì the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) procedures.' [9] 
Freeland and others like to call CETA and Canada 'progressive,' but CETA was never voted on by Canada's Parliament or by any provincial/territorial legislature. [10] 
So under the Harper Conservatives, we had a Canadian federal government that not only insisted on the ISDS provisions in CETA, but refused to brief Members of Parliament on the deal and neglected to have CETA debated and voted on in Parliament. This all happened while Justin Trudeau was leader of the federal Liberals, who Craig Scott says were '100 per cent' behind the deal, 'as evidenced by the support Trudeau gave Harper back in the fall of 2013' by 'fawning' over CETA's prospects. [11] 
Scott warns about 'the continuation of a Liberal-Conservative tag team pushing old-style [neoliberal] economics' and writes: 'Have no doubt that the present Canadian government is keen to resist truly progressive revisions to CETA. Have no doubt that Liberals want to retain a flawed ISDS system that undermines the democratic sovereignty of countries 'ì and one that sets the wrong example for future trade policy.' [12] 
Investor Lawsuits 
The year 2015 saw a record high of 70 new ISDS corporate lawsuits filed against countries under NAFTA and various bilateral treaties, raising concerns worldwide about ISDS and the ways corporations use it to bleed governments financially while putting a 'chill' on any new regulations. Even if a government wins an ISDS lawsuit, it will have spent an average of $8 million in legal fees to defend itself. 
To date, the most thorough report on ISDS is called Profiting from Injustice, written by Pia Eberhardt of Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO) and Cecilia Olivet of the Transnational Institute. [13] They revealed that a 'small club of international law firms, arbitrators and financial speculators are fueling an investment arbitration boom that is costing taxpayers billions of dollars and preventing legislation in the public interest' across the planet. They found a handful of legal firms 'are actively encouraging corporate clients to sue governments' under investment treaties containing the ISDS clause, while 'top arbitrators are using their influence to secure investor-friendly rules and sustain the flow of multi-million dollar lawsuits.' 
At the heart of this 'secretive but burgeoning legal industry,' they found an 'inner mafia' of fifteen arbitrators who (as of 2012) had decided on 55% of all known ISDS disputes 'ì earning millions in fees for themselves and billions in ISDS settlements for their corporate clients. That 'inner mafia' includes three Canada lawyers: Marc Lalonde, L. Yves Fortier, and Henry Alvarez; four American lawyers: Charles Brower, Stephen M. Schwebel, William W. Park, and Daniel Price; and eight other lawyers from France, Chile, Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. [14] 
After CETA opponents in Europe roundly attacked the ISDS private court system, the trade deal's investor-protection chapter was rewritten this past February. But a March 2016 report from CEO called the rewrite basically a PR re-branding exercise, giving ISDS a new name: the Investment Court System (ICS). Otherwise, 'the proposed 'new' ICS is ISDS back from the dead,' Pia Eberhardt wrote in the report appropriately called The Zombie ISDS. [15] Under CETA's rebranded ISDS, the three for-profit arbitrators (now to be called 'judges') who decide each case would be drawn from a pool of lawyers and would be paid US $3,000 per day, on top of a monthly retainer fee of 2,000 euros per month. As well, they can moonlight as lawyers with the same corporations launching the lawsuits. 
This conflict of interest is what the Walloons have been arguing against and resisting, noting that the so-called 'Joint Interpretive Declaration' of Oct. 13 does not clarify the situation. Investment law professor Gus Van Harten agrees, informing The Canadian Press that 'Such matters should be resolved and subject to discussion and debate well before relevant decision-makers are requested to approve CETA.' [16] But there are other highly controversial aspects of ISDS that are getting little, if any, press 'ì for example, what's called third-party funding of lawsuits. 
ISDS Gambling 
Profiting from Injustice revealed that private investment funds have been speculating on ISDS court cases: lending money to companies so they can sue governments, and then taking a percentage of the final financial award. Such a gamble can be very lucrative: in a recent ISDS lawsuit, a national government was ordered to pay a whopping $50 billion to the claimant. 
So-called 'third-party funders' have become a fast growing industry as corporations outsource financial risk to 'litigation finance shops' who receive cash to gamble with. 
Profiting from Injustice states, 'Imagine a multinational company eager to sue a government on the basis of an international investment treaty. It is about to hire a top arbitration law firm as counsel. But the lawyers charge astronomical fees 'ì more than the company is willing to pay. Fortunately for the company, an investment firm offers to invest in the case. It pays parts of the lawyers' pay cheque in exchange for getting a share of the potential profits at the end. Welcome to the world of third-party funding'¶A world flush with monumental settlements and glaring opacity, a place where public treasuries are treated like ATMs by arbitral bodies and awards can be enforced globally 'ì this is a world that third-party funders are particularly interested in'¶Banks, hedge funds and insurance companies also invest in international [ISDS] disputes.' [17] 
Obviously, this little-known world of ISDS litigation 'ì where 'public treasuries are treated like ATMs' 'ì needs far more exposure. It operates within most of the trade deals currently being pushed across the planet. So not only are signatory countries losing their sovereignty to the corporate sector, they're losing their shirts (as the saying goes). 
While CETA would allow thousands of European companies to sue Canada under ISDS for 'lost future profits,' some 42,000 U.S. multinationals that have branch-plants in Canada could similarly sue European governments through CETA 'ì a kind of 'backdoor' in case the equally controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the U.S. and the EU collapses. This is another aspect of what the Walloons have been resisting in CETA. At Galati's Oct. 25 press conference, court challenge plaintiff Paul Hellyer rightly called the trade deal 'monstrously immoral.' 
High Stakes 
But the stakes are even higher for Canada. As Rocco Galati explained, because of NAFTA 'the U.S. and Mexico automatically get all the benefits of CETA that are not present in NAFTA,' while Canada would get no further benefits from those two countries. 
The Canadian constitutional challenge against CETA is bolstered by an Oct. 17 'Open Letter' by ten prominent Canadian academics to the Parliament of Wallonia and Belgium voters. They write: ''¶In Canada, our democracy has suffered because the federal government has insisted on pushing through agreements like the NAFTA and the CETA without legislative votes at the federal and provincial levels. As a result, and without the corresponding endorsements by our elected representatives, we have been left with a foreign investor protection system that binds all levels of government and that will bind all future elected governments in Canada for a very long time. Our experience hints at the dangers faced by European democracy in the case of the CETA'¶.From what we can see, you have shown great courage in opposing the CETA and, based on our observations of how the foreign investor protection system has been pushed on Canadians over the years, we wish to express our support for your democratic choices.' [18] 
During the press conference, Galati pointed to a stack of paper about three-feet tall on the conference table and identified it as the 1,600-page CETA text. 'You're supposed to read and understand this in your spare time,' he joked to those gathered. Fortunately for other Canadians, Galati has read the CETA text and 'ì like the plaintiffs he represents: Paul Hellyer, Ann Emmett and George Cromwell 'ì wants 'democratic choices' beyond what Canadian tradition allows. The erosion of democracy is becoming that evident. 
As reports of a new CETA compromise in Belgium began to emerge on Oct. 27, the Council of Canadians issued a press release stating, 'The democratic exercise that is taking place in Europe right now 'ì where the Walloon government has looked at the text with its citizens, and asked for changes 'ì needs to take place in Canada.' [19] That is exactly why Galati and the co-plaintiffs have filed their constitutional challenge.

This month, the Pentagon admitted it has used uranium weapons in attacks inside Syria 'î violating its public promise last year that it would not use DU there, and contradicting the claim that US bombing is done in defense of the Syrian people, according to the Int'l Campaign to Ban Uranium Weapons . 
Like the Pentagon's past denials of the dangers of the chemical weapon Agent Orange, US military officials still claim publicly that its uranium weapons are not known to cause health problems. Made from waste uranium-238 'î left from H-bomb and reactor fuel production 'î it is called 'depleted' uranium (DU) but is only 'depleted' of U-235. Ironically, the best evidence that it is dangerously toxic and radioactive 'î contrary to press pronouncements 'î comes from the Pentagon itself. A June 1995 report to Congress by the Army's Environmental Policy Institute (AEPI) concluded: 'Depleted uranium is a radioactive waste and, as such, should be deposited in a licensed repository.' 
Military studies done in 1979, '90, '93, '95 and '97, make clear that uranium weapons are chemically toxic, alpha-radiation-emitting poisons that are a danger to target populations and to invading/occupying US forces alike. In spite of this cautionary written record, the military has been shooting its radioactive waste all over the world: into population centers in Iraq in 1991 (380 tons), in Afghanistan in 2001 (amounts unknown); in Bosnia in 1994-'95 (five tons); in Kosovo in 1999 (10 tons), in Iraq again in 2003 (170 tons); and now in Syria. 
The AEPI report above also says that DU has the potential to generate 'significant medical consequences' if it enters the body. The Army's Office of the Surgeon General, in its Aug. 16, 1993 'Depleted Uranium Safety Training Manual,' says that the expected effects of DU exposure include a possible increase of cancer, and kidney damage. The manual also warns, 'When soldiers inhale or ingest DU dust, they incur a potential increase in cancer risk '¶ (lung or bone) and kidney damage.' 
The Army's Mobility Equipment, Research & Development Command reported way back in 1979 that, 'Not only the people in the immediate vicinity but also people at distances downwind from the fire are faced with potential over exposure to air-borne uranium dust.' This uranium 'dust' is generated when DU shells hit and burn through hard targets like tanks or armored vehicles. The uranium is spread for miles by the wind, contaminating everything is its path including food, water, soil, schools, hospitals, etc., and DU is radioactive forever, or ten times 4.5 billion years, whichever comes first. 
In 1990, the Army's Armaments, Munitions and Chemical Command radiological task group said that DU is a 'low level alpha radiation emitter '¶ linked to cancer when exposures are internal, [and] chemical toxicity causing kidney damage.' It added that 'there is no dose so low that the probability of effect is zero.' 
With evidence of its radio-toxicity so clear and redundant, any use of uranium weapons today appears to flaunt the military's own Field Manual prohibition 'î absolute and universal 'î against the use of poison or poisoned weapons. 
Historical Disregard Revisited 
The military has a long history of deliberately exposing US citizens and others to deadly risks without their knowledge or consent, beginning with the open-air nuclear bomb tests it knew would contaminate vast areas. The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) chose not to evacuate or even warn downwind populations it knew would be hard-hit by radioactive fallout. ('Fallout risk near atom tests was known, documents show,' New York Times, March 15, 1995) These bomb tests exposed Nevada Test Site workers to levels of radiation that the AEC knew could cause harm, but the agency chose not to reduce workers' exposures or to even inform them of the risks because doing so would have scandalized and halted the bombing tests. ('Records say workers faced high radiation: Suit contends US used no safeguards,' St. Paul Pioneer Press, Dec. 14, 1989) 
Likewise, the government refused to inform some 600,000 H-bomb factory workers that workplace radiation exposures posed serious health risks, although enough was known about radiation to warn them in 1948. ('N-plant workers not told of risks: Report says US arms program exposed many to radiation,' Associated Press, Dec. 19, 1989) Between 1944 and 1974, 'medicalized' human radiation experiments were even conducted on unwitting US citizens, 16,000 of them (The Plutonium Files, by Eileen Welsome). 
Today, the Pentagon extends this ghastly history into Syria where it is deliberately exposing human beings to weaponized radiation that it knows can cause cancer and other diseases. As if the undeclared, unconstitutional war in Syria weren't unlawful enough, now add the crime of using poison in violation of military law and the Hague Regulations of War on Land. 
It is so easy to prove that DU is poison, that a group of four non-lawyers, myself included, convinced a Minneapolis jury in 2004 that AlliantTechsystems' manufacture of the shells is unlawful enough to excuse an otherwise illegal trespass; our minor offense was justified in order to prevent the greater harm of DU weapons production. Like torture, the use of such poison in war is always criminal, akin to gas war. This latest US government war crime must be condemned in the harshest terms.

Email That this election is an abysmal disgrace is nationally acknowledged; that it is absolutely unique is not, although it's undeniable. Never before has virtuallly the entire mainstream media avidly, emphatically endorsed one Presidential candidate while furiously, contemptuously vilifying the other. Never has a sitting President joined in general denunciation of a candidate. With ten days to go it's affirmed by most key sources that Donald Trump can't win and Hillary Clinton will. Many pundits predict a landslide for her. Assume it. What then? The most hated President-elect ever will not be loved by the Congress she will confront. Even with a majority in the Senate'ìjust possible'ìand in the House'ìnot'ìprospects for a legislative agenda, should she have one, are non-existent. What Obama's phony charm failed to achieve, Hillary's lack of it will scarcely obtain. This presages four more years of stasis and nullity, of social and economic rot, financial chicanery, and national decay. As regards the composition of the Supreme Court'ìthe panicky Liberal pitch for being 'with her''ìunless she nominates hidebound conservatives, which is probable, not a single selection will be confirmed during her term. So'¶ paralysis in Congress, reaction in the Court; two limbs of government neutralized, gives us rule by a disliked, distrusted figurehead with the full power of Wall Street and the Imperial War-loving Establishment behind her. What then will be accomplished? First, the interests of The Empire will be promoted at least as robustly as in Obama's eight years of sycophancy. Including his Rube Goldbergian Obamacare, still foundering and gouging, nothing of any benefit to Americans was achieved under this charlatan who perfected the skill of describing an airplane crash as a triumph of gravity. So what will she do in office? Well, start with what she won't do. She won't make any effort to restrain The Big Casino, the Gold Sacks Mafia. They made her an offer she couldn't refuse. She won't attempt any closing of the inequality gap. That would entail clipping her base'ì'Our Crowd' of the Hamptons, Palm Beach and Beverly Hills. She won't meddle with Sick Care'ì'fool me once'¶''ìor, corporate tax enforcement. Her Big Donors don't want to pay them and why should they, right? She can just let Labor die of its own raging leukemia. College grads have to stay in their parents' basements and service their college debt via Macdonalds because Arbeit Macht Frei. No need to do anything about Global Warming so long as you denounce it boldly at international meetings. Best leave the environment in the hands of those who can turn idle nature into money. Besides, the solution to pollution is dilution and clearcuts grow back in a millenium or so. On the minor agenda, she knows there are still small poor countries who require our R2P and cluster bombs. Others have resources that, with the odd military coup or assassination, should come on line nicely. Africa, say, has low-hanging fruit, and the Latin American mess needs our firm hand to prevent Lefty dictators diverting perfectly good profits to their own societies. Turning to the major crises, Exceptionalism requires that they be made far bigger. Our Defense Industries can't be expected to muck along forever on paltry brushfire wars: Iraq, Afghanistan'ìthough in fairness they've profuced steady income streams'ìand Libya, no bonanza, and Syria, which Putin's diabolical meddling prevented blossoming as we hoped. Still, there's no earthly reason we can't achieve a profitable Third World War simply by refusing to take the bait of Satanic Putin's wimpy peace offers and calling them what they really are: a mortal threat to our Capitalist System. So much for her first Hundred Days. Beyond the panicked cheerleading of the Imperial Elite'ìthose that the late, great George Carlin referred to as 'your owners''ìand their failing organs of crowd manipulation, and beyond the day Clinton takes office if their hopes are consummated, America faces a cataclysmic crisis of governance; one of the order of magnitude of the secession of The South under Lincoln. Clinton and Trump are the physical, mental and emotional symptoms of that crisis. Our dead system must, and will, have catharsis. Which of them precipitates it may not greatly matter. Or it may mean everything. As Brutus said at Philippi: 'Oh, that a man might know the end of this days business ere it come; but it sufficeth that the day will end and then the end is known.'

In the US, the political system has now disgorged two candidates the citizenry cannot be less enthusiastic about. Driven by ambition more than a love of the people or a sincere desire to serve, one can be forgiven for wondering if they are just as trapped by their motivations as the public in its two-party myopia. No authentic leader among the two '¶ 
These thoughts lead to the rage of my youth, existentialism, and to Jean-Paul Sartre, who died 36 years ago last April. More than 50,000 mourners lined the streets and packed Montparnasse cemetery at his funeral, many quite young 'î improbable they would exhibit a similar interest in the successor philosophies, notably the current preoccupation with deconstruction, a focus on whether the written or spoken word is successful (or not) in clarity of meaning. 
Difficult as existentialism may be to pin down, there are a few necessary elements: the individual, free will as crucial to human existence, the subsequent responsibility for action that accompanies it, leading to an unavoidable anxiety as a consequence. The authentic life then is one chosen freely rather than imposed by society. No wonder it appealed to the young. 
What triggered this meandering into Sartre and his philosophy was Hillary Clinton's two-minute summing up at the end of the last debate. She attested to her lifelong concern (her latest claim) for improving the lives of children 'î a phrase bringing to mind a balancing scale. One one side the improved lives of children in Arkansas and the benefits of subsidies to children in general, and on the other the deaths of hundreds of thousands in Iraq, Syria, Libya and elsewhere 'î the most vulnerable that is the old, the sick and the children bearing the brunt. Politicians are a breed apart, unconcerned with 'responsibility' and undisturbed by Sartre's 'anxiety'. 
Not so long ago there was another US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, who, when asked about the 576,000 children who had died (according to a UN report) as a result of the Iraq embargo, simply dismissed the question as a price to be paid to be rid of Saddam Hussein. The embargo failed in that regard, and when Saddam was removed by the successor US government's military intervention, it resulted in chaos and the birth of ISIS. 
The Republican candidate, Donald Trump, is unique, in that responsibility washes over him and into the shower drain like a layer of dirt; he is devoid of it even in personal interaction. The only rational explanation of his behavior is the term 'prolonged adolescence' used by professionals. 
His basic issue over several decades has been bad deals 'î bad deals in defending allies who he feels do not pay enough for their defense and bad trade deals. Trying to peel off some voters, Hillary Clinton in the last debate pointed out that he took out an ad in The New York Times opposing the right's iconic Ronald Reagan over it. Like any business owner or high level executive, he intends to issue orders expecting them to be carried out. Good luck! It might explain the absence of concrete policy. 
The American public has been short changed into picking either the lesser of two evils, casting a protest vote with the minor left or right party, or just sitting this election out. 
Sartre offered personal bliss in the few post-war years of hope and promise before America's fear of ideologies and overweening sense of power plunged us into successive wars punctuated with interludes of peace. The wars continue, bleeding the country of an estimated $5 trillion in the present cycle '¶ the death and destruction the worst since the Second World War.

I've written a couple pieces of the smoking hot issue in Pivotland, Philippine president Duterte's swerve toward a pro-PRC foreign policy, and what the U.S. and pro-American sector of the Manila elite are going to do about it. 
The first piece, Reports of death of US-Philippine alliance may be exaggerated, addresses the fact that Duterte's freedom of movement is constrained by the need to keep the Philippine military happy, and notes that ex-prez and retired general Fidel Ramos, who facilitated Duterte's entrance on the national political stage, is signaling dissatisfaction with Duterte. 
The second piece, Duterte Plays the 'Mamasapano' Card, covers a Duterte counter-attack: a threat to relitigate the death of 44 Philippine National Police commandos at Mamasapano in Mindanao, a 2014 special ops fiasco conducted under the aegis of the United States which a) exposes ex-president Aquino to serious legal jeopardy b) posits that the US alliance is doing a better job of killing Filipinos than the PRC can ever hope to do. 
The US seems to be embedded in a colonial mindset when it comes to the Philippines, something along the lines of 'we've been selflessly looking after the Philippines for a century, and that thug Duterte won't be allowed to screw that up during his brief (maybe curtailed) presidency.' 
It takes a pretty superficial view of Philippine history, one that accepts the US self-definition as the Philippines' security savior while ignoring the distortions and shortcomings of the colonial and neo-colonial relationship. 
For me this tunnel vision was typified by the US media crowing over the formal delivery of a refurbished C-130 transport to the Philippine government by outgoing ambo Philip Goldberg. Message: here's the US making provisions for Philippine defense at the same time Duterte's selling out the country to China. 
To me, the inadvertent message was 1) here's the US blindly stroking the pivot fetish while Duterte tries to solve the Mindanao insurgency that has cost at least 400,000 lives over the last century, win his drug war, and find a place for the Philippines in Asia that doesn't give primacy to the US preoccupation confronting the PRC and 2) the U.S., in my opinion, pretty much has a policy of keeping the Philippines flat on its behind as an independent military force by trickling out second-hand gear to the Philippine military while the sweet stuff is dangled in front of it during US joint military maneuvers and port calls. 
But the United States is trying to find political leverage wherever it can and the Western media will, I'm sure, put its shoulder to the wheel to help out. 
Philip Goldberg sat down for a 45-minute exit interview with Rappler. As befitting Rappler's origins in the Soros/Omidyar network of pro-US globalization advocacy, the interview was a stream of softballs about what to do about Duterte's disregard of the awesomeness of the American relationship, an awesomeness that is acknowledged by virtually all Filipinos who inexplicably (and, if the US has anything to do about it, temporarily) at the same time give Duterte approval ratings of over 80%. 
It's worth watching if you have the patience. Goldberg is a smooth cat, and the Rappler tonguebath gives you no inkling of the fact that he intimately familiar with the wet work of end-arounding national governments to cultivate secessionist movements, you know, like what he did in Bolivia (declared persona non grata as a result) and Kosovo, and like that thing in Duterte's home province of Mindanao, which in my opinion probably the main reason why Duterte wanted him out of the Philippines. 
Goldberg also discretely plays the economic threat card, concern-trolling that anti-US attitudes will dismay 'foreign investors'. 
It will be interesting to see how this plays out in subsequent weeks. As far as I can tell, the biggest U.S. factor in the domestic Philippine economy is the call-center industry. I doubt US corporations are interested in actually pulling their operations out and subjecting them to the English-language mercies of India, but certainly a call from the State Department or White House would convince them of the wisdom of at least making the threat. 
And I also wonder if expected President Hillary Clinton will find it necessary to drop the hammer on Duterte, in order to demonstrate to a rather dubious Asia that there is no alternative to loyalty to the pivot. 
I expect the next few months, in other words, to be very interesting.

The verdict is in and all charged with impeding federal officials with force at the armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge were exonerated. The Prophet Ammon must feel vindicated that his prophecies are true, taking it as a sign as he, Ryan and others head to Nevada for their February pageant. 
The feds have struggled with the fringe Mormons since Buchanan's Blunder, the folly of their Short Creek ways culminating in Malheur through a lack of establishing a secure perimeter, allowing them free travel, of FBI HRT coverup, narrow charges, and finally in the surreal tazing of attorney Marcus Mumford. The verdict and their collective ineptitude should give them pause regarding as they proceed to the Bunkerville trail in February. 
I've argued that those involved in the Malheur takeover were engaging in Seditious Conspiracy , a charge that is both broad and carries a sentence of 20 years, defined as: 
If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to overthrow, put down, '¶ or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both. 
Certainly, a larger net with many more conspirators with more plea deals to roll for information to convict the leadership. Anyone providing material, financial, recruiting, or other support would be captured by the dragnet. 
I have evidence of material and other support that was given to the occupation leadership by the Utah contingent that met them the weekend of January 7-9, 2016. This group prepared press releases, brought supplies, discussed roles on how each could assist in cleaning up PR messaging after Tarpman and advising for legal issues like weapons. Many have not been contacted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
What is also forgotten and confirmed by sources is the Church knew Ammon would leave if they asked him to do so, the reason for a midnight run meeting with them to Salt Lake City where Utah contingent members who lead the rancher permit renouncing Storm Over Rangelands during the occupation, Todd MacFarlane and Jon Pratt, appealed to them to ask Ammon to leave. The Church did not, an indictment of how a 'God fearing benevolent religion' did not accept the role of ending an armed standoff that had a high likelihood of ending in bloodshed 'ì and did. 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints must feel anxious regarding their inaction. No doubt the combined Bundy standoffs in Nevada and Bunkerville with radical prophets pontificating unofficial doctrine, discredited the Church and its agricultural business interests 'ì the largest in the nation. Perhaps with the exoneration they can continue to put the LDS Malheur contingent's excommunication on hold. 
The Bundys must feel empowered but beyond seditious fundamentalist theo-constitutionalist sagebrush Mormons from Dixie and Deseret, so, too, must Constitutional Sheriffs, militias, white supremacists, grazing permit renouncing ranchers, and other Trump voters around the country. 
In fact, activists of any stripe are now free to use guns to ensure 'they are taken seriously'. Perhaps forest defenders, particularly the brave women, need protection. Maybe those people of color at Black Lives Matter protests need to ensure for their safety. Maybe the climate and water defenders involved in the Dakota Access Pipeline action need to get serious defending mother earth. 
I fear for law enforcement and public lands officials who in the future will be constantly facing armed protesters, standoffs, and remain distrusted by all sides. The same for our legal system, as today, with the Malheur verdict, it certainly has not won the trust of any as, yet another of a thousand cuts to efficacy in the American system of civil government. 
I can't wait to get the Hillary Rodham Clinton administration underway. 
To leave on a positive note, I believe the Malheur occupation has strengthened the resolve of public lands advocates and all citizens who cherish the freedom and biodiversity of our public lands. All of us have been largely complacent, unaware of the very real threats people like the Bundy theo-cons and their corporate extractive business interests are to the public interest. It appears we still have a lot of work to do.

Election eve, one finds the nation itself to be more pathetically unaware than the leading candidates are evil (morally reprehensible, arising from actual or imputed bad character or conduct), although the margin of difference is negligible. The crowds gathered to hear Clinton and Trump, t-shirts and hoodies decorated with campaign slogans, are two sides of the same mindless fascistic adoration of power, righteousness, indignation, a voluntary submission betraying the same ideological convictions of American exceptionalism and psychodynamics of gut hatred for and fear of difference from themselves and image of ethnocentric superiority. 
Study the faces as the news cameras pan the waiting lines or audiences, smugness, occasional contorted features, feigned innocence disguising certitude. The emptiness of the American public, obediently laying down before billionaire wealth and militaristic narcissism (here self-love engendered through capitalism and assisted by compulsive attachment to the hegemonic purposes of the State). Each side, contemptuous of the other, in reality, brothers/sisters-in-arms, raises to leadership the perfect expression of their own, and hence similar if not identical, needs for recognition to cover their inner nakedness of spirit and purpose. 
Trump, a bottomless pit of mammon-worship, Clinton, a sinkhole of war and aggression, express the fusion of capitalism and militarism, each in America vital to the presence and fruition of the other, that typifies the national mission of unilateral global domination. It was not always thus, although historical-institutional development pointed the direction for at least a century, when America outstripped its earlier foundations, the normalization of advanced industrial capitalism, to claim world moral-political pre-eminence based on spurious privileged association with God in carrying out His/Her divine mission of promised economic salvation. 
The formula has been a surefire winner because scrupulously backed by the real or implied threat (and use) of force, a silent militarism when not engaged in war to announce global financial-and-market penetration presumed to be uncontested (or when contested, the mark of the adversary). Exceptionalism is the ideological battering ram to knock down all opposition, and for those standing in line for the political bread-and-circuses of the two major parties, a validation of their distorted hatreds brought on by their own subordination in the great chain of capitalist being. 
If deep-down, though not consciously admitted, there is recognition of systemic rottenness in misshaping their yearnings and thwarting their present wellbeing and future prospects, this throws them, again both sides of the supposed political divide, into the arms of the Leadership Structure not unlike the authoritarian submission characterizing fascism in the transition from Weimar to Nazi Germany. (To be still in the transition phase and not to have as yet crossed the line, holds little promise of reversion to democratic government; too much has happened to suggest drawing back from the brink.) Collective ego-loss, seen in the faces of the ecstatic political faithful, the now-worshippers of power, goes a long way to explaining the candidates and their visions on offer. 
A closed system awaits the body politic. There is little room for turning left or right, when the center subsumes an already hard-bitten right and the near-ejection of the left from the political spectrum. The vanished center, however fictitious, is kept alive for purposes of self-deception and authoritative indoctrination, a useful cloak for democratic pretentions, as meanwhile the society is placed, willingly so, on a permanent footing of structural hierarchy at home, incessant intervention abroad. The interests of capitalism must be guarded (and celebrated) at all times, lest an alternative way of life become visible, founded on humane standards of international peace and societal betterment. To break out of the present imprisonment in invidious class debasement, is more painful, given long-term ideological habituation, than risking a future of freedom (of system, of conscience, of social solidarity). 
Thus, only days remain in the exercise of meaningless choice. After that, one can expect few impedances to the downward cast of policy, with increasing risks of war, class division, false consciousness to grease the rails of additional discontents as context for resentments and hatreds poisoning the atmosphere. More environmental spoliation, more gun violence, as tokens of the wayward path to fascism.

Six Gulf Protectors were arrested outside the New Orleans office of the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management . They were taken into custody by Federal Protection Service agents of the Department of Homeland Security during an action by Nonewleases.org urging President Obama to cancel oil drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico. 
'We began the event in solidarity with those from the Sioux Nation who are standing up to the Dakota Access pipeline ,' said Anne Rolfes of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade , one of the organizations participating. 'As Gulf Protectors we are calling on President Obama to live up to his climate legacy and permanently cancel future leases in the Gulf of Mexico.' 
The six arrested were: Alicia Cooke, Danil Faust, Alison Kalnik, Ben Quimby, Noah Rahman, and Reverend Jim Vanderweele. Booked on federal charges of obstructing an entrance to a federal building, they were advised they have to each pay a fine of $530 or go before federal court for trial. 
Alicia Cooke, a member of 350 Louisiana , explained why she was willing to be arrested. 'To maintain a livable climate, experts estimate that around 80% of existing fossil fuel resources must stay in the ground. At current consumption levels, we need to place an immediate moratorium on new fossil fuel infrastructure projects and we also must scale back on existing projects. The industry and government executives who dismiss our concerns out of hand because we drive fuel-powered vehicles or use air conditioning are missing the point. A transition to a renewable energy economy at the speed required by science will not be easy for any of us. It will take a full-hearted acceptance of climate science and an enormous collective will. But when you look at the climate math, it is quite literally our only choice.' 
Iris Carter of Concerned Citizens of Norco explained why she was there to protect the Gulf. 'Oil is killing people. Just look at my own family. I grew up between a Shell refinery and a Shell chemical plant and when my mother and sister got sick, the doctors asked if we lived near pollution. It's not fair. And now people have to go and fish in the Gulf 'ì after oil companies leave all that mess. Look what they left from the spill that BP did. That was bad. And it's no better. They keep going out and drilling and spilling in our Gulf. And that's just not right.' 
Cheri Fotlin of BOLD Louisiana challenged the feds for excluding the public. 'The head of BOEM , Abigail Hopper, had promised to come down and meet directly with our communities who continue to be adversely affected by oil production in and along the Gulf. At the last minute, she backed out. Additionally, BOEM recently stopped allowing public participation at point-of-sale lease auctions. At every turn our voices have been oppressed by this federal agency. We deserve to be heard. If she won't come to us, then we have no choice but to go to BOEM ourselves to make our wishes known. We want protection. We want respect for our lives. No new leases, not here, not anywhere!' 
Four others were arrested in August at the same place and charged with state criminal trespass. Their trial is still pending. 
The group promises to return and escalate their actions to protect the Gulf.

A few weeks ago the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center celebrated its 50 th anniversary. It was back on September 16, 1966 that the Met opened its doors at the newly built Lincoln Center (its previous home was a few blocks away) with the premiere of Samuel Barber's Anthony and Cleopatra. Recent years have seen the Met in financial trouble. If the National Endowment for the Arts is to be believed the audience for opera is in decline- back in 2002 the percentage of American adults that see their annual opera was 3.2; by 2012 it dropped to 2.1 percent. Given its gigantic 3800 seat structure the company is forced season after season to stage grand operas, i.e. operas that even occasional viewers have seen at least once, at the expense of newer smaller scale pieces. A couple of decades ago the Met earned 90 percent of its potential box office revenue, a number that has dropped to 66 percent last season. Prices are up to on average about $160 per head (besting the average Broadway ticket by over $50). The company's plan to have performances screened in movie theaters and libraries has generated some revenue but seemingly not enough. A couple of years ago the start of the opera season was almost derailed by a strike by its unionized set artists and camera operators over company calls for a pay cut. 
It's an ironic fate for a grandly built structure that was billed as a Cold War asset whose purpose was to elevate the cultural taste of the masses. Designed by a group of then prestigious architects coordinated by Wallace Harrison of the firm Harrison and Abramovitz, who had a similar role in designing the UN, Lincoln Center's imposing blend of classicism and modernism has few architectural defenders. Missing from any promotions about the 50th Anniversary Gala is a reference to another musical with roots that go back to Lincoln Center's origin. West Side Story opened on Broadway in 1957. By the time the Jets and Sharks met on the big screen in 1961, their Lincoln Square neighborhood was bulldozed to make way for Lincoln Center. The local working class population and a mosaic of small businesses, there were over 600 in the project footprint, were displaced. 
By no means was the clearing out of 48 acres for Lincoln Center the only such West Side initiative. This was the era of Robert Moses and slum clearance and the West Side was a prime target. Further uptown the Morningside Heights-Manhattanville neighborhoods, which like Lincoln Square were working class with a growing Puerto Rican population, saw their share of destruction and displacement, mostly to make way for new housing its residents couldn't afford. 
In the present day West Side the beat goes on. Recently Thomas Heatherwick's centerpiece design for Hudson Yards was unveiled. Named 'Vessel', the $150 million structure will stand 15 stories and feature 154 interconnecting staircases with 2500 climbable stairs. Hudson Yards, which its developers bill as 'the largest private real estate deal in the history of the United States' (the main developer is Related Companies, probably the biggest developer in the city), is slated to be the city's next great commercial district, a 21 st century Rockefeller Center, with over a dozen skyscrapers, millions of square feet of office space, and luxury housing (with the requisite small percentage labeled 'affordable'). Built on 26 acres own by the MTA, the public corporation that runs the city's buses and subways and the Long Island Railroad (the land has served as a storage facility for trains from nearby Penn Station), the neighborhood has long been in the sites of politicians and urban planners- full of truck stops and warehouses it has been almost universally declared the 'last undeveloped land'. The ultimate vision has been to move Midtown's CBD across 8 th Ave into Hell's Kitchen which, while gentrifying in recent times, still retains some of its historic working and middle class, the last such place in the middle of Manhattan. The beauty of the acreage belonging to the MTA is that technically as a state agency plans for their use are somewhat exempted from the normal city review process. The tragedy is as an agency whose leadership is appointed by the state and city, and is subsidized heavily by both, it isn't hard to imagine property it owns becoming, with only a bit of political maneuvering, in some way public. Instead the subsidies are again flowing to a developer: a $3 billion bond offering, a promise to pick up any debt service shortfall, and one to cover any over budget costs for the subway expansion to the development. By the end of 2014 the city paid out $650 million. Even city officials acknowledge such subsidies will be needed until 2019. 
The backdrop to Hudson Yards is the High Line. A much lauded 1.45 mile elevated park built on the leftover tracks from New York Central Railroad's West Side Freight Line, the High Line draws millions of visitors a year. Targeted to be torn down at several instances, its preservation was spearheaded by a grassroots effort (the Friends of the Line now maintain and operate the park, a public-private arrangement that characterizes many of the city's parks going back to the early 1980s). The High Line draws raves from planners worldwide; however absent other reform the practical effect of the High Line has been to send property values soaring. It was soon surrounded by a stream of starchitect designs including Norman Foster, Rem Koulhass, and the late Zara Hadid. Hadid, renowned for being the first female recipient of the Pritzker Prize, also became somewhat infamous for an August 2014 answer to an interview question about working conditions in Dubai where she designed the Al Wakrah stadium for the 2022 World Cup. When questioned about the fatal conditions for construction workers Hadid coldly replied 'I have nothing to do with the workers. I think that's an issue the government 'ì if there's a problem 'ì should pick up. Hopefully, these things will be resolved.' While there have been no worker fatalities building 520 West 28 th , the social effect for New York can be inferred from the prices that range from just under $5 million up to $50 million per unit. 520 W 28 th by Zara Hadid. 
Earlier this year downtown saw the opening of Santiago Calatrava's Oculus. Built at the foot of the rebuilt World Trade Center (the original version, a product of the Rockefeller family's desire to rescue their real estate investments in what was then a depressed downtown, itself was a destroyer of tens of thousands of jobs along Radio Row, and another project that was built on land owned by a public corporation- The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey) Conceived in post 9/11 narcissism The Oculus came in a decade late it for a price tag of over $4 billion, about triple its initial cost estimate. This boondoggle of a train station will serve less than 50,000 riders a day. 
A short walk from there up Broadway and one will catch sight of Frank Gehry's 8 Spruce St with an average rent of $5500 a month. Meanwhile over on the Lower East Side, the corner of Delancy and Essex Streets display a close-up view of Bernard Tschumi's Blue Condominium. The average sale price there is $1.5 million. A little further uptown, the American Cooper Buildings will soon open on First Avenue. Designed by SHoP Architects, these twin towers feature a copper facade with a three story sky bridge connecting them- the bridge is equipped with a gym and 75 foot lap pool (SHoP also designed the hideous Barclays Center in Brooklyn for the Nets-another eminent domain inspired effort). If height is your thing, Billionaire's Row on West 57 th Street features Rafael Vi√±oly's 432 Park Avenue, currently the tallest residential building in the world. At 93 feet wide and 1396 feet tall, it's 15 times as tall as wide. The penthouse went for $95 million, just below the $100.5 million penthouse sale at the Christian de Portzamparc designed One57 right down the street. 432 Park by Rafael Vi√±oly. 
It wasn't all that long ago when architecture represented something besides extreme global inequality and cultural homogeneity. In a 2007 essay titled 'What Happened to the Social Agenda', sociologist Nathan Glazer wrote: 
Modernist architects and city planners believed they could do better than the profit-inspired builders of housing for the working classes who crowded as much building as they could onto the land available. It seemed to make sense, and indeed it made some sense. 
The public housing Glazer referred to here has for decades been reviled. Its rational architecture came to be seen as isolating and plain. From a theoretical standpoint it was said to be given the coup de gr√¢ce by Jane Jacobs in her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities (though this is simplistic, Jacobs supported the building of the modernist West Village Houses, not public housing but originally part of the Mitchell-Lama program, a state housing program aimed at the working class). Surely Robert Moses was more interested in 'slum clearance' than housing the working class. That doesn't change the fact that public housing, at least at first, improved housing conditions for working poor. Nor can architecture's interest in the issue be denied. Politically public housing was left to rot by federal withdrawal, poor (often racist) placement, subsidized suburbs, and ideology. St Louis was the first city to demolish its public housing: the Pruitt Igoe complex was dynamited live on TV in 1972. By the time the destruction came Pruitt Igoe was so run down its occupancy was less than 35 percent. More recently Chicago took its turn. However in New York, for all its flaws and debt, public housing is functioning well enough to have a waiting list. The decline of public housing in most cities was a failure of politics; still architecture also took the blame. 
For modernism's failures real and perceived, Glazer wrote of architects: 
The architect could then conclude that if modernism could do nothing for social problems, if the expectations of architectural determinism were na√Øve, why bother: Let us devote ourselves to architecture alone- to building design and form -instead of to architecture and city planning 
In other words status quo, political neutral buildings that reflect the excess of the global elite while demonstrating no purpose beyond their own genius. It goes without saying that architects can't determine city planning policy on their own, yet there is no reason, given the housing crisis ravaging many cities, for the profession not to push the envelope in a more inclusive direction. And there is no inherent reason such a movement would have to return to the bland bricks of modernism's housing projects. Earlier this year 2016 Pritzker Prize winner, Chilean architect Alejandro Aravena , posted a number of his designs for low-cost housing for free on his firm Elemental's webpage. In an interview with Dezeen, Aravena said of architects and social housing: 'But the constraints are not just budget constraints 'ì the building logic, the political framework, and the policies, are part of the equation and we're not well trained for that. We're never taught the right thing at university.' 
One can only hope that changes. Architects can be valuable allies to progressive city planning. For that to happen though the word 'starchitect' would have to take on different, and grander, meaning.

While the recent police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott has led to increased scrutiny on police activities in North Carolina, police-community relations are not the only reason racial tensions are flaring. While encounters with police officers can radically differ depending on the race of those involved, access to economic resources tend to follow a similar pattern. Although racial gaps regarding wealth, incomes, and healthcare are nationwide issues, observing them from a statewide perspective can help understand why specific communities feel maltreated. 
A UNC Chapel Hill study found that the income and wealth disparities between African Americans and whites in North Carolina are far worse than the national average. It states that: 
'¶black households, at the median, claim only about 13 percent of the wealth and, stunningly, about 4 percent of the net worth of white households. The corresponding figures for the nation are bleak: 15 and 13 percent respectively. Median wealth for white households is roughly seven times that of black households'¶Nationally, black households have about half the home equity of whites. In North Carolina, it's about a third. 
The study goes on to state that half of all black households in North Carolina have under $100 in savings. At the median, black heads of household aged between 50 and 65 own $17,000 in assets compared to white households' median of $143,000, which seriously hampers older, black workers from retiring comfortably. This data paints a picture of a state that fails to allow black communities from advancing economically and obtaining some semblance of equality. 
The issue is further exasperated by lack of access to health insurance. A North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services study found that 13% of North Carolina whites have no health insurance as compared to 22% of blacks. 16% of whites were reported to be in 'fair or poor' health as compared to 23.2% of blacks. The Kaiser Family Foundation research shows that the majority of non-elderly uninsured North Carolinians were minorities: 30% Hispanic and 14% black, while 10% were white. This is especially concerning considering minorities experience disease at a higher rate than American whites, and visit the doctor at much lower rates. The result: communities most in need of medical assistance are least likely to attain it. 
This imbalance is in part due to the state government's failure to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, something which would have significantly reduced the coverage gap between those receiving Medicaid and those obtaining income-based subsidies. The North Carolina Justice Center finds that, had the expansion gone through, 500,000 low-income North Carolinians would have health insurance who currently don't have it, and over 1,000 unnecessary deaths would have been prevented. 
While the protests in Charlotte appeared to be a backlash against apparent police brutality, underlying economic factors also come into play. A breaking point will eventually be reached by those living in undesirable economic situations which they view as consequential of a racist and unfair system. The case of North Carolina is a particularly negative one, but the principles outlined in this research are not unique to North Carolina. Americans cannot expect race relations to cool until access to income, wealth, and healthcare are equalized and structured in a fair, equitable manner.

A new poll from an unlikely source suggests that the U.S. public and the U.S. media have very little in common when it comes to matters of war and peace. 
This poll was commissioned by that notorious leftwing hotbed of peaceniks, the Charles Koch Institute, along with the Center for the National Interest (previously the Nixon Center, and before that the humorously named Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom). The poll was conducted by Survey Sampling International. 
They polled 1,000 registered voters from across the U.S. and across the political spectrum but slanted slightly toward older age groups. They asked: 
'Over the last 15 years, do you think U.S. foreign policy has made Americans more or less safe?' 
What, dear reader, do you say? 
If you say less safe, you not only agree with dozens of top U.S. officials the week after they retire, but you agree with 52.5% of the people polled. Those who said 'more safe' add up to 14%, while 25.2% said 'about the same' and 8.3% just didn't know. 
Well, at least all these humanitarian wars to spread democracy and eliminate weapons and destroy terror have benefited the rest of the world, right? 
Not according to the statistics that show terrorism on the rise during the war on terrorism, and not according to 50.5% of poll respondents who said U.S. foreign policy has made the world less safe. Meanwhile 12.6% said 'more safe' while 24.1% said it was about the same and 12.8% didn't know. 
Asked about four wars in particular, registered U.S. voters said each of them had made the U.S. less secure, by a margin of 49.6% to 20.9% on Iraq, 42.2% to 18.9% on Libya, 42.2% to 24.3% on Afghanistan, and 40.8% to 32.1% on bombing ISIS in Syria. 
These answers should not immediately be taken to prove that the U.S. public is universally wise and well informed, and (not coincidentally) at odds with U.S. media. Not only is that margin pretty slim on ISIS, but 43.3% of those polled said ISIS was the greatest threat the United States faces. Meanwhile 14.1% named Russia, 8.5% North Korea, 8.1% the national debt, 7.9% domestic terrorists, and bringing up the rear with the correct answer of global warming as the greatest threat were a grand total of 4.6% of those polled. 
A survey of U.S. news reports would certainly suggest a point of agreement here between the public and the media. But here is where it gets interesting. Although the public believes the hype about danger emanating from these foreign forces, it does not favor the solution it is endlessly offered by the media and the U.S. government. When asked if, compared to last 15 years, the next president should use the U.S. military abroad less, 51.1% agreed, while 24.2% said it should be used more. And 80.0% said that any president should be required to get congressional authorization before committing the U.S. to military action, while 10.2% rejected that radical idea that's been in the U.S. Constitution since day 1. 
The U.S. public may look quite depressingly ignorant in a quick survey of Youtube videos, but check this out: Asked if the U.S. government should deploy U.S. troops on the ground in Syria 51.1% said no, compared to 23.5% who said yes. Only 10% said yes on Yemen, while 22.8% said no 'î however, 40.7% said the U.S. government should keep 'supporting' Saudi Arabia in that war. 
Good majorities also oppose Japan acquiring nuclear weapons, Germany acquiring nuclear weapons, or the U.S. defending Taiwan against a Chinese attack. (Who invents these scenarios?) 
This moderately encouraging survey of public sentiment stands in stark contrast to U.S. media coverage of wars in general and Syria in particular. The New York Times' Nicholas Kristof is ready for a bigger war as are columnists in the Washington Post and USA Today, as well as, of course Chuck Todd and other televised talking head. Meanwhile Hillary Clinton's comment to Goldman Sachs that a 'no fly zone' would require 'killing a lot of Syrians' has received dramatically less press than her brave calls for creating a humanitarian no fly zone, and the steady depiction of that proposal as 'doing something''î in contrast to the only other option: 'doing nothing.' 
The public, however, rejects the only 'something' that's on offer and just might leap at the opportunity to try something else, if anyone ever proposed anything else.

Caracas. 
What happened last week in Venezuela has the appearance of a demolition derby. President Nicol√°s Maduro, whose PSUV socialist party is something like a rickety 1970s Thunderbird, picked up speed on Friday and smashed into the opposition's equally crusty ride as it was lurking around the edges of the field, lost in daydreams about an easy transition. 
It was a good move. As a result of the collision, a few doors fell off Maduro's already scrappy vehicle. The opposition, on the other hand, was left with an almost completely crippled and useless chassis. Moreover, Maduro had formerly assured that the Vatican's hulking Impala station wagon 'î experienced in all kinds of fairground acts 'î was at hand to steamroll whatever remained in the field. 
As always, Venezuelan politics offers stunning demonstrations about how to struggle radically for power. Years of sitting on what is possibly the planet's largest oil reserves have provided a rich training ground in power games that far exceed the imagination of most of the world's politicians. This latest move on the part of the government was one that required careful balancing and timing, despite the smashup nature of its concluding step. 
Here is how the whole thing happened. The government had been facing the ugly prospect of a referendum to revoke the president in 2017. This voting process, even if it wouldn't take Chavism out of power (since the constitution dictates that the vice president will assume power if the president is revoked during the last two years of his term), would almost surely have showed high disapproval of the government. What to do? It was a burning question since the Venezuelan opposition had already won an ample majority of votes in last year's parliamentary elections. 
The headquarters of actually-existing Chavism was not going to passively let itself be immolated. First, it worked out a way to slow the opposition's apparently inexorable advance toward the referendum by having the Supreme Court rule that the twenty percent of the voting population's signatures needed to go forward with this process should be collected in every one of Venezuela's twenty-three states. This is something hard, though not impossible, for the opposition to do in states with dispersed populations. 
However, it also worked on another more daring angle: that of claiming that the one-third of fraudulent or questionable signatures in the more than a million and a half signatures already collected to initiate the referendum process should invalidate the whole procedure and require the referendum's indefinite postponement. 
This latter was a bold and dangerous move. So first the government bloc began testing the ground, by having the invalidation decision confirmed by lower penal courts. It only had the National Electoral Council pronounce once it had secured the support of the head of the military, Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez. With that key piece in place, it revved up the apparatus's engines and went barreling into the opposition with the new ruling, smashing up its prospects of a referendum. 
Maduro is an experienced driver and knew that sparks would fly: that there would be yelps about violation of the rule of law, protests, international commotion, etc. Indeed, there was smoke and fire but in the end the Socialist Thunderbird, however clipped in the wings, would be sitting in the middle of the field with almost nothing else budging. 
This is all very interesting and surely worth studying in poli-sci departments worldwide. But is it good for anything except maintaining power? 
The truth is that the left finds itself up against the ropes globally. For that reason, the consensus in Cuba, China and Venezuela today seems to be that one must maintain power and sovereignty at any price. Even if it means smashing up your own apparatus and adopting two-thirds of the program of your enemy. In a radical revision of traditional leftist politics, today's rebellious governments hope that by preserving a minimally sovereign platform, they will at some later day be able to resume advancing on the social front. 
This is a hope, but it is far from being a certainty. From their celestial repose, Marx and Lenin may be peering down at today's leftist governments and be genuinely puzzled by their bizarre, even desperate politics. Yet those who have boots on the ground can look to Maduro and recognize that at least he is not doing nothing. Despite a few bruises on his forehead, the President is now humming My Way in a battered machine that undoubtedly dominates the field.

In an historic move the United Nations First Committee voted Thursday to convene a conference next March to negotiate a new treaty to ban the possession of nuclear weapons. The vote is a huge step forward in the campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons launched several years ago by nonnuclear weapons states and civil society from across the globe. 
Dismayed by the failure of the nuclear weapons states to honor their obligation under Article VI of the Non Proliferation Treaty which requires them to pursue good faith negotiations for the elimination of their nuclear arsenals, and moved by the growing danger of nuclear war, more than 120 nations gathered in Oslo in March of 2013 to review the latest scientific data about the catastrophic consequences that will result from the use of nuclear weapons. The conference shifted the focus of international discussion about nuclear war from abstract consideration of nuclear strategy to an evaluation of the medical data about what will actually happen if these weapons are used. It was boycotted by all of the major nuclear powers, the US, Russia, UK, China and France, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, or P5. 
Further meetings in Nayarit, Mexico and Vienna followed in 2014 and culminated in a pledge by the Austrian government to 'close the gap' in international law that does not yet specifically outlaw the possession of these weapons. More than 140 countries ultimately associated themselves with the pledge which was fiercely opposed by the United States and the other nuclear weapons states, and in the fall of 2015 the UN General Assembly voted to establish an Open Ended Working Group which met in Geneva earlier this year and recommended the negotiations approved Thursday. 
The United States, which led the opposition had hoped to limit the 'Yes' vote to less than one hundred, but failed badly. The final vote was 123 For, 38 Against and 16 Abstentions. The 'No' votes came from the nuclear weapons states, and US allies in NATO, plus Japan, South Korea and Australia which have treaty ties to the US and consider themselves to be under the protection of the 'US nuclear umbrella'. 
But four nuclear weapons states broke ranks, with China, India and Pakistan abstaining, and North Korea voting in favor of the treaty negotiations. In addition, the Netherlands defied intense pressure from the rest of NATO and abstained, as did Finland, which is not a member of NATO but has close ties with the alliance. 
Japan which voted with the US against the treaty has indicated that it will, nonetheless, participate in the negotiations when they begin in March. 
The US and the other nuclear weapons states will probably try to block final approval of the treaty conference by the General Assembly later this fall, but, following Thursday's vote, it appears overwhelmingly likely that negotiations will begin in March, and that they will involve a significant majority of UN member states, even if the nuclear states continue their boycott. 
The successful completion of a new treaty will not of itself eliminate nuclear weapons. But it will put powerful new pressure on the nuclear weapons states who clearly do not want to uphold their obligations under the Non Proliferation Treaty even as they insist that the nonnuclear weapons states meet theirs. 
We have come perilously close to nuclear war on multiple occasions during the last 70 years, and we have been incredibly lucky. US nuclear policy cannot continue to be the hope that we will remain lucky in the future. We need to join and lead the growing movement to abolish nuclear weapons and work to bring the other nuclear weapons states into a binding agreement that sets out the detailed time line for eliminating these weapons and the detailed verification and enforcement mechanisms to make sure they are eliminated. 
This will not be an easy task, but we really have no choice. If we don't get rid of these weapons, someday, perhaps sooner rather than later, they will be used and they will destroy human civilization. The decision is ours.

At the branch office of the Pentagon's US-NATO military alliance in Brussels there is a never-ending whirl of activity and apart from provoking Russia by announcing an aggressive military surge around its borders, its latest achievement was to have Belgium issue 'a commemorative stamp depicting the new NATO Headquarters and its distinctive architecture.' 
On October 22 a ceremony was held to mark the new stamp, but no details were given about the price of the vast palace which will ' enable all Allies to have the space they require and [in which] there is also space for expansion should the need arise.' There is never any mention by US-NATO of the staggering cost overrun that took place, but two years ago Germany's Der Spiegel revealed that it was more than double the original construction budget, at over a billion euros. 
Ten days before the stamp ceremony, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg left the Brussels Palace to visit a more modest one in Italy where he met Pope Francis. After his call, some observers were unkind enough to express surprise that Mr Stoltenberg could spare the time for such an appointment, but all was made clear when it was announced that the meeting took place in the sidelines of his visit to Rome to celebrate the establishment anniversary of the NATO Defense College, an institution that has contributed generously to the Italian economy. 
His Holiness the Pope did not of course make a public statement about the meeting, but the NATO publicity machine (the large and remarkably expensive organization that also arranges stamp issue ceremonies) made up for the omission by announcing that he and his illustrious visitor 
discussed global issues of common concern, including the conflicts in Syria and the wider Middle East, the importance of protecting civilian populations from suffering, and the importance of dialogue in international affairs to reduce tensions. The Secretary General also stressed that climate change could pose a significant security risk. 
It is remarkable that His Holiness engaged in such deliberations with the titular head of an enormous nuclear-armed military alliance, and it would be interesting to know if the Pope mentioned that he did not always agree with the policies espoused by Mr Stoltenberg and his directors in Washington, as he averred earlier this year. 
It will be recollected that in February 2016 Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church met with Pope Francis in Havana and that Western media headlines included 'Pope Francis Handed Putin a Diplomatic Victory' which was as absurd as it was trivial. But even The Economist headline was similarly slanted and amusingly asked 'Did the Pope Just Kiss Putin's Ring?' This set the tone for other comment, but one thrust of its reporting was especially revealing, as it pointed out in shocked 'î shocked 'î tones that the Pope had 'made clear in his interview before the meeting that on certain issues he agrees with Mr Putin and disagrees with America and its allies.' 
How truly dreadful that the Pope dares to be impartial and ventures to disagree with America and its allies about international affairs. 
The Economist further noted that 'On Libya, where Western powers helped to bring down former dictator Muammar Qaddafi, the pope was explicit: 'The West ought to be self-critical.' And he continued that 'In part, there has been a convergence of analysis between the Holy See and Russia'.' The Economist did not mention the unpalatable fact that the 'western powers' 'î the US-NATO military alliance 'î bombed and rocketed Libya to a catastrophic shambles, resulting in anarchy and a base for Islamic terrorists. Perhaps the Pope had taken note of that merciless Blitz, and of the fact that under the dictator Gaddafi the Catholic community in Libya had lived peacefully while now it is suffering gravely. 
As recorded by Christian Freedom International , 'The upsurge in attacks on Christians in Libya since the Obama/Clinton supported ouster of Gaddafi is of grave concern. CFI condemns these abductions, killings and attacks on Christian property in what is becoming an increasingly inhospitable region for Christians.' Perhaps Pope Francis raised this with the devout Mr Stoltenberg, a graduate of Oslo Cathedral School who was prime minister of Norway when its air force ' carried out about 10 percent of the NATO airstrikes in Libya' from March to July 2011. 
The news that the Pope has had the temerity and moral realism to 'disagree with America and its allies' is not altogether surprising, but the report that 'on certain issues he agrees with Mr Putin' must have shaken Mr Stoltenberg, whose fundamental stance is that 'Russia is trying to kind of re-establish spheres of influence along its borders and for me this just underlines the importance of strong NATO, of strong partnership with other countries in Europe that are not members of NATO.' 
Mr Stoltenberg believes that because Russia wants to establish 'î or, more accurately, maintain 'î spheres of influence along its borders then it must be discouraged or even stopped from doing so. This is confrontational, and it is unsurprising that His Holiness has made it clear that the Vatican is not an unconditional supporter of Washington's Pentagon and its palatial sub-office in Brussels. 
Mr Stoltenberg may not have read the address to the US Congress by His Holiness in 2015, when he said 'We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the golden rule: 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you'.' As reported , 'The line drew instant, thunderous applause from Democrats, followed with some hesitation by Republicans, a pattern repeated throughout the address.' 
In his talk to Congress Pope Francis eschewed the Stoltenberg line that Russia's desire to maintain peaceful 'spheres of influence' around its borders must by definition be wrong and unacceptableand pointed out that 'there is another temptation which we must especially guard against : the simplistic reductionism which sees only good or evil; or, if you will, the righteous and sinners.' 
As President Putin observed in an interview with Italy's Corriere della Sera 'we are not expanding anywhere; it is NATO infrastructure, including military infrastructure, that is moving towards our borders. Is this a manifestation of our aggression?' No, it is not 'î except in the eyes of such as the Pentagon and Mr Stoltenberg. 
Stoltenberg makes many visits round the world, including head-of-state-style attendance at the UN General Assembly in New York, where he had discussions with, among others, Ukraine's President Poroshenko ( 'Dear Petro, it's great to see you again' ) and Secretary General Ban Ki-moon; and another recent stopover was in the United Arab Emirates on October 19. There, while committing NATO to an Individual Partnership and Cooperation Program he ' praised the UAE for its role as a valuable NATO partner in projecting international security and stability: from Kosovo, to Afghanistan to Libya.' 
Perhaps Mr Stoltenberg's meeting with the Pope affected his short-term memory. He ignores the unpalatable facts that in Kosovo, as Freedom House reports , there has been 'little progress in strengthening its statehood,' while Afghanistan verges on total anarchy and, as noted above, US-NATO's war on Libya destroyed the country. These are far from being examples of 'security and stability' as Mr Stoltenberg would have us believe them to be, but self-delusion knows no borders. 
When Stoltenberg was made head of NATO, President Putin considered him to be a 'serious, responsible person' but warned with prescience that 'we'll see how our relations develop with him in his new position.' Unfortunately that apprehension concerning future developments has been more than justified. During a trip to Washington in April, Stoltenberg told the Washington Post correspondent Karen de Young, that 'NATO has to remain an expeditionary alliance, able to deploy forces outside our territory,' which is a plain unvarnished statement of expansionism. The Pope summed it up when he quoted the Bible's advice to 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you,' but it is unlikely that Mr Stoltenberg could ever bring himself to abide by such wise advice. More confrontation lies ahead.

History should tell us that writing scolding, even scornful letters, to electorates as part of a conversation for persuasion do not work. They are even less effective when coming from outside that electorate, however well-intentioned. Non-voters should be careful to judge and lecture. 
Consider the attempt on the part of The Guardian to mount its electoral high horse prior to the 2004 Presidential elections in the United States. The prospect of another four years of George W. Bush was hard to stomach for the editors, hence their disruptive project. Operation Clark County was advertised as an effort to write 'to undecided voters in the crucial state of Ohio.' The experiment had more than a degree of condescension, slanted, as it were, to the superior across the pond wisdom. 
Instead of providing a platform of sobriety, it simply supplied patriotic fuel to US voters to confirm their positions. No one was going to be telling them what to do. Their president was a fool, but was their fool. As one letter went, 'We Ohioans are an ornery sort and don't take meddling well, even if it comes from people we admire and with their sincere goodwill. We are a fairly closed community overall.' [1] Even the New York Times came forth with an unmistakably frank headline: 'British Two Cents Draws, in Sum, a Two-Word Reply: Butt Out.' [2] 
Nobel Prize winner and former president of Timor-Leste, Jos√© Ramos-Horta, should be more attuned with that recent history. But instead, he has decided to wade into the US elections with another letter of scorn, another experiment in persuasion. To add weight and magnification to the appeal, he is seeking the signatures of fellow Nobel Prize laureates. The direction of this letter promises to be simple: whatever you do, people of the US, don't vote for Donald Trump next month. 
During a brief visit to the northern Australian town of Darwin, Ramos-Horta explained how he and his friends, 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates, are extremely concerned with the tone of a presidential candidate Donald Trump in making disparaging remarks about migrants, about Muslims, and refugees.' 
Ramos-Horta insisted that the rise of such a figure was 'extremely worrying for all of us and it does not serve US interests.' Along with his fellow laureates, he was hoping to pen a letter that would 'alert American public opinion that the world '¶ cannot afford extremism coming from the White House itself.' 
Ramos-Horta provides us a fairly typical, if rusted view, of world power. Empires need the wise and clever to lead them, being repositories of responsibility. Lunacy has no place. 'The US is an indisputable global power and global powers have to be led with prudence, with enormous wisdom.' 
What of the brakes of moderation and restraint offered by a critical, at times unreasonable Congress, including other measures so carefully thought through by the Republic's Founding Fathers? We have seen such brakes bringing the Republic to a screeching halt on occasions, notably during the Obama years. These are polarized times in US politics, and not even the supply of finance to public servants is sacred. 
This is of little interest to Ramos-Horta, who is convinced that a Trump presidency would have Congress in his deceptively deep pocket to wage war with impunity and engage in a pattern of global mischief making. 
'Whatever the US president and US congress may decide on some measure of issues internationally can enhance peace, but can provoke instability and world disorder.' Not that the record book on peace, stemming from US foreign policy in recent years, has been particularly enhancing. 
Having dumped generously on Trump, Ramos-Horta admits a swooning admiration for Hillary Clinton, his preferred White House occupant. If there is a candidate bound to embark on more aggressive stances, be it towards Iran or Russia, few could come close. Her recipe is for greater, not lesser belligerence. Free world boisterousness indeed. 
Taking leave of his senses, Ramos-Horta suggested that she was 'outstanding' and 'sensitive to the rest of the world'. With baffling adolescent gullibility, the Nobel Prize laureate saw a Clinton 'extremely sensitive to education for poor people, for children'. 
A sense of balance might have been appropriate at that point: questionable donations from despotic regimes to the same, supposedly helpful foundation open to helping the indigent and illiterate; or security breaches; or compromised arrangements with Wall Street. The world of power is dark, and maze ridden, and at the end of it usually lurks a Clinton apology. 
A Clinton presidency would hardly be that prudent, nor particularly wise, but that is the Ramos-Horta verdict, his own variant of an external endorsement that is bound to fall on deaf ears in the United States. Any ears who receive the message will be dismissive. From a man whose country suffered an occupation that will, in time, find its way into the books of notable genocides, endorsing such a Clinton can hardly be prudent. But then again, power of the massive sort rarely is.

Some eight to ten thousand refugees have been living in an improvised camp in Calais currently being demolished by French officials. All they've gotten from the French government so far has been tear gas and the bulldozers set to tear down the tents and shacks where they have survived amid the cold and mud thanks to the help of fellow refugees and humanitarian volunteers and organizations. The NGO Help Refugees said that as of 24 October it had a list of 1,028 'unaccompanied' children in the camp, 49 under the age of 13, one an 8-year-old boy. These are kids who lost their families at home, or were separated from them as they travelled across half the world thorough the most difficult and dangerous conditions imaginable. 
Many of these children 'ì about 40 percent, according to the NGO Terre d'Asile 'ì came to Calais, on the English Channel, because they have family in the UK and are therefore legally entitled to asylum there. During the first ten months of this year, under public pressure, the UK admitted a grand total of 79. This came only after an enormous outcry among British people. A Parliamentary measure to admit all refugees under 13, sponsored by a prominent member of the House of Lords, who was himself given asylum in the UK as a 6-year-old fleeing the Nazi persecution of Jews, went largely ignored until the last week, when the British authorities finally let in 200. It took a strong protest from the British Dental Association to stop plans to x-ray the teeth of children claiming asylum to prove their age. Many other refugees in Calais are entitled to enter the UK because they have a spouse or other close relative to live with there, but neither the British nor French governments care to implement European Union laws and agreements. 
This is, in fact, official UK government policy. Prime Minister Theresa May was infamous for her rabidly anti-foreigner positions when she was Home Minister. She took the lead among her European counterparts in cutting off funding to Italian-led search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, calling saving lives a 'pull factor' for 'threats we face'. 
When the French police attacked and destroyed about half the Calais camp earlier this year, 129 children simply went missing. A Help Refugees spokeswoman says she fears this will happen again, since no government will take responsibility for these children. One reason that many people do not want to leave the camp is that they have built up ties, mutual-help networks and other arrangements that enable them to survive. They have no reason to believe that the French and other authorities who have displayed nothing but alternating neglect and brutality will offer an acceptable solution to their predicament. These kids reached Calais after travelling through many other countries whose governments were no more welcoming than France. 
What will happen to these refugees when their camp is bulldozed? The plan is for them to be herded into buses, split up into small groups and sent to hundreds of 'welcome centres' scattered across the country. Five of these centres have already been fire-bombed. Right now there are about 500 media people in Calais 'ì NGO members say they fear that when the camera lights go out, refugees who have refused to get on a bus 'voluntarily' will be attacked by security forces or the small fascist bands that a thousand police mysteriously cannot hold back sometimes. 
The biggest nationality group in the camp is people from Afghanistan, who literally crossed mountains and deserts to flee the mess the US and Nato made of their country. Under a recent agreement with the Western powers, the Afghan government is to accept the forcible return of its refugees in Europe, as many as hundreds of thousands. Ethiopians (whose government is closely allied with the US), Eritreans and other Africans are not generally considered deserving of refugee status. Trying to get by as an 'illegal' immigrant is the most rational choice for many people, rather than applying for asylum, getting fingerprinted and maybe expelled. Some people have come to Calais seeking safety in numbers after being forced out of smaller camps in Paris and elsewhere. 
The people in Calais are not just some unfortunate anomaly, an exception that proves the rule that the world is OK. Their desperate presence tells the truth about an unacceptable world dominated by a handful of countries that have prospered at the expense of the vast majority of the planet's people, through both plunder and war, and the normal workings of a global system of exploitation. The fact that there are 63.5 million refugees and displaced people in today's world, according to the UN, is an irrefutable proof 'ì only one of too many 'ì that the capitalist-imperialist system does not work for humanity and the planet. 
While the British, French and other European governments squabble among themselves about who should help which immigrants, each taking in as few as possible as slowly as possible, some people not only refuse to accept this inhumanity but take responsibility to do something about it. A middle aged, middle class woman in the French city of Nice, near Italy, heard on her car radio that French police were blocking the city's train station to keep out refugees who had walked across the border. She dropped her daily schedule, went to the station, invited refugees into her car and drove them to train stations where the police would not be expecting them. Someone snitched on her and she was arrested and hit with a huge fine. Overnight hundreds of people sent her enough money to pay it. A New York Times article refers to 'a French underground railroad, moving African migrants'. While lots of 'citizen collaborators tip off the French police', 'a low-key network of citizen smugglers are countering police efforts in a quasi-clandestine resistance, angered by what they see as the French government's inhumane response to the crisis.' (4 October 2016) The 'migrant crisis' that governments today consider a police problem could become part of a political crisis, with big questions at stake about what kind of society people want, or will accept. 
What do the imperialists, fighting amongst themselves to run this world, mean by the words 'migrant crisis'? For them, it is a 'crisis' that a few people have slipped into Europe, the UK, the US, Australia and other imperialist fortresses. To promote racism, they call the Calais camp 'the jungle,' when their capitalist system has turned our planet into the dog-eat-dog place it is today. The real crisis is not Calais but the world. The system's own workings are generating vast upheavals that no wall can hold back, and that cry out for the overthrow of this system in country after country. 
Postcript 28 October 
The prefect in charge of evacuating the camp pronounced 'Mission accomplished', meaning that the site has been emptied and the riot police will not allow anyone to come back. The departure was hastened by massive fires consuming tents and shelters, which the prefect claimed trhe migrants themselves had set because it was a 'custom' in their cultures. According to the 28 October Le Monde , about a hundred refugees are sleeping in the cold and rainy streets of Calais, some of them minors, with no place to go. 
Some people who let seem to be very happy with their new lodgings, according to Le Monde and other media, but police are accompanying the buses taking them to nearly every corner of the country, with orders not to let anyone change their mind along the way. About 90 people were taken straight to jails, with no explanation as yet.

History should tell us that writing scolding, even scornful letters, to electorates as part of a conversation for persuasion do not work. They are even less effective when coming from outside that electorate, however well-intentioned. Non-voters should be careful to judge and lecture. 
Consider the attempt on the part of The Guardian to mount its electoral high horse prior to the 2004 Presidential elections in the United States. The prospect of another four years of George W. Bush was hard to stomach for the editors, hence their disruptive project. Operation Clark County was advertised as an effort to write 'to undecided voters in the crucial state of Ohio.' The experiment had more than a degree of condescension, slanted, as it were, to the superior across the pond wisdom. 
Instead of providing a platform of sobriety, it simply supplied patriotic fuel to US voters to confirm their positions. No one was going to be telling them what to do. Their president was a fool, but was their fool. As one letter went, 'We Ohioans are an ornery sort and don't take meddling well, even if it comes from people we admire and with their sincere goodwill. We are a fairly closed community overall.' Even the New York Times came forth with an unmistakably frank headline: 'British Two Cents Draws, in Sum, a Two-Word Reply: Butt Out.' 
Nobel Prize winner and former president of Timor-Leste, Jos√© Ramos-Horta, should be more attuned with that recent history. But instead, he has decided to wade into the US elections with another letter of scorn, another experiment in persuasion. To add weight and magnification to the appeal, he is seeking the signatures of fellow Nobel Prize laureates. The direction of this letter promises to be simple: whatever you do, people of the US, don't vote for Donald Trump next month. 
During a brief visit to the northern Australian town of Darwin, Ramos-Horta explained how he and his friends, 'Nobel Peace Prize laureates, are extremely concerned with the tone of a presidential candidate Donald Trump in making disparaging remarks about migrants, about Muslims, and refugees.' 
Ramos-Horta insisted that the rise of such a figure was 'extremely worrying for all of us and it does not serve US interests.' Along with his fellow laureates, he was hoping to pen a letter that would 'alert American public opinion that the world '¶ cannot afford extremism coming from the White House itself.' 
Ramos-Horta provides us a fairly typical, if rusted view, of world power. Empires need the wise and clever to lead them, being repositories of responsibility. Lunacy has no place. 'The US is an indisputable global power and global powers have to be led with prudence, with enormous wisdom.' 
What of the brakes of moderation and restraint offered by a critical, at times unreasonable Congress, including other measures so carefully thought through by the Republic's Founding Fathers? We have seen such brakes bringing the Republic to a screeching halt on occasions, notably during the Obama years. These are polarised times in US politics, and not even the supply of finance to public servants is sacred. 
This is of little interest to Ramos-Horta, who is convinced that a Trump presidency would have Congress in his deceptively deep pocket to wage war with impunity and engage in a pattern of global mischief making. 
'Whatever the US president and US congress may decide on some measure of issues internationally can enhance peace, but can provoke instability and world disorder.' Not that the record book on peace, stemming from US foreign policy in recent years, has been particularly enhancing. 
Having dumped generously on Trump, Ramos-Horta admits a swooning admiration for Hillary Clinton, his preferred White House occupant. If there is a candidate bound to embark on more aggressive stances, be it towards Iran or Russia, few could come close. Her recipe is for greater, not lesser belligerence. Free world boisterousness indeed. 
Taking leave of his senses, Ramos-Horta suggested that she was 'outstanding' and 'sensitive to the rest of the world'. With baffling adolescent gullibility, the Nobel Prize laureate saw a Clinton 'extremely sensitive to education for poor people, for children'. 
A sense of balance might have been appropriate at that point: questionable donations from despotic regimes to the same, supposedly helpful foundation open to helping the indigent and illiterate; or security breaches; or compromised arrangements with Wall Street. The world of power is dark, and maze ridden, and at the end of it usually lurks a Clinton apology. 
A Clinton presidency would hardly be that prudent, nor particularly wise, but that is the Ramos-Horta verdict, his own variant of an external endorsement that is bound to fall on deaf ears in the United States. Any ears who receive the message will be dismissive. From a man whose country suffered an occupation that will, in time, find its way into the books of notable genocides, endorsing such a Clinton can hardly be prudent. But then again, power of the massive sort rarely is.

I was living in New York City when Patty Hearst was kidnapped in February 1974. Like millions of others at the time, I followed the unfolding story with interest. At a time when news was relayed via the radio, newspapers and a daily evening news show, there was plenty of time to speculate what lay behind the actual story. In other words, there weren't self-appointed experts on every 24-hour news channel telling the viewer what to think. A few months later, I watched the murder of six of the kidnappers on live television. Many media historians consider that event to be the beginning of the 24-hour news cycle we live with now. As Brad Schreiber points out in his newly published investigation of the group responsible for the Hearst kidnapping titled Revolution's End: The Patty Hearst Kidnapping, Mind Control, and the Secret History of Donald DeFreeze and the SLA , it was a new technology that first made this live coverage possible. 
Yet, this is not the focus of Schreiber's text. Indeed, Revolution's End is about much more than the kidnapping or its coverage. Instead, it is an investigation into the creation of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), its roots in various law enforcement agencies and its intention to destroy the underground armed left of the early 1970s in the United States. While not a new theory by any means, Schreiber's narrative is the first such attempt to examine this possibility for the general public. 
From the moment the public'îincluding the Left'îbecame aware of the SLA's existence; doubts about their origins were expressed. In large part, at least on the Left, this was due to the group's confused and nebulous politics. Claiming to be an anti-racist organization, the first public attack they made was on the African-American superintendent of schools in Oakland, California, Marcus Foster. Popular among progressives for some of his pedagogical approaches and his relatively forward thinking on issues of race and class, the SLA gunned him down in 1973. Their rationale was that he was instituting a pass system for students similar to the pass system in use by the South African apartheid authorities. In reality, Foster was opposed to the plan and was working to limits its reach in terms of accessibility by the Oakland Police department. Schreiber describes the assassination, writing that the two men convicted of the murder were not actually the gunmen in the crime. In fact, according to Schreiber and his research, it was the leader of the SLA, Donald DeFreeze aka Cinque, who along with a female member, actually committed the murder. 
The persona of DeFreeze is the linchpin to the claims about the SLA's connection to law enforcement investigated in the book and previous investigations. The primary investigation was conducted by the Los Angeles-based Citizen's Research and Investigation Committee in the 1970s. The Black Panther Party newspaper published some of this research, showing the connections between DeFreeze, well known LAPD informant/provocateur Louis Tackwood, and California law enforcement agencies in Sacramento. In addition, it is alleged that DeFreeze also worked for the FBI and was a participant in various drug and mind control experiments during his imprisonment in Vacaville California Prisons Medical Facility. 
Like millions of others in the 1970s, I was fascinated by the story of the SLA as it played out in the media. From the kidnapping of Patty Hearst to the distribution of the food ransom to poor people in various California cities to Hearst's conversion to an urban guerrilla, the unfolding drama was certainly better than most shows on TV. In addition, as a new left activist who was looking (along with many others) for an effective means to make a difference in a political milieu whose numbers were diminishing, I participated in numerous discussions about the SLA and its meaning for the rest of the left. While much of the Left dismissed the group as adventurists, crazy or police provocateurs, the fact of their existence left others wondering if maybe they weren't sincere, albeit somewhat misreading the political climate both on the Left and in the greater public. 
Even more fascinating than the publicly known story of the SLA, Schreiber's text takes an extended and serious look at a possible deep narrative regarding the genesis of the SLA. As noted above, it is a narrative often suspected by many leftists and others regarding the group's beginnings. By accepting Schreiber's work, it makes it easier to understand why its members did some of what they did. In essence, Revolution's End describes a covert operation undertaken by various law enforcement agencies that went off the rail. Succinctly put, Revolution's End postulates (and does a fairly good job of proving) that the group that became the Symbionese Liberation Army was begun in part as an attempt to ferret out potential violent radicals in California while simultaneously attempting to discredit the revolutionary left. Donald DeFreeze played a role as both patsy and organizer while in Vacaville Prison. His role as provocateur raised suspicions, but somehow he was able to belay them. In the meantime, he took advantage of the leeway given him in the prison to sleep with various women on the outside. According to Schreiber, one of these women was Patty Hearst, who was involved in the prisoner rights movement in the period during which the SLA was originally formed. Schreiber describes the SLA as a group with three distinct phases. The first was set up by informants for the above reasons, the second went from this entity to a genuine, albeit confused political group, and the third came after the deaths of members in a police attack on their hideout. It was the last of the formations that included Patty in a more fundamental role than before, as she hid out in communes and hideouts around the United States until she was finally captured with Wendy Yoshimura in 1975 in San Francisco. 
Schreiber's text covers all the manifestations of the SLA except the last. In doing so, he provides the reader with a look at the nature of an element of the radical underground left in 1970s United States. Even more so, though, is the detailed and convincing examination he provides the reader of how police agencies can and do work to destroy the political enemies of the corporate state. It is this latter aspect that seems most important today, when the intelligence capabilities and legally granted powers to law enforcement agencies are so much greater than they were forty years ago. One need only look at the various entrapment schemes arranged by the FBI and other agencies that have cornered various folks into terror plots that would probably never have existed without the financial, logistical and motivational assistance of those government agencies.

The United States' abstention on a resolution to end its economic embargo on Cuba-a first time it happens after opposing it for 24 years- is an implicit acknowledgement of the wrongness of such a measure. It has brought considerable and unnecessary suffering to the Cuban people and hasn't brought any positive results to the U.S. 
Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said in September that damage from the embargo between April 2015 and March 2016 amounted to $4.6 billion and to $125.9 billion since the beginning of the embargo more than 50 years ago. By maintaining the embargo, the U.S. has been a target of derision throughout the world, as shown by the repeated and overwhelming U.N. Assembly decisions against the embargo in the last 24 years. 
In repeated visits to Cuba I was able to observe the impact of the embargo on the Cuban people. During my first visit to Cuba in 1981 to attend a public health-related meeting, I witnessed an unusual incident. As friends and I walked into the Bodeguita del Medio 'î a traditional restaurant famous for its many illustrious visitors over the years (Hemingway was a frequent patron) 'î a young Cuban male was discreetly asked to leave. 
Realizing we weren't locals, the young man began ranting against government restrictions on Cubans. 'I have money,' he told us. 'But they prefer foreigners to eat and spend their money here. I am fed up with this regime.' As we were observing the scene, he asked us, 'Do you see something in that corner?' 
'Yes,' I said, 'there is a man standing there.' 'You are wrong,' he replied. 'He is not a man. That's a gigantic ear listening to everything I say to you. But I don't care. I am so sick and tired of this situation.' In those few minutes, I got a first-hand sense of the problems besieging Cuban society: the need for foreign money, the oppressive nature of the regime and the dissatisfaction of the country's youth. These impressions were later confirmed during a later visit to the island when I headed a UN mission to assess the progress of Cuban scientists in developing interferon, an antiviral substance. 
Highlighting the Cuban government's shortcomings doesn't diminish its achievements. During my last visit I met Fidel Castro. Although we didn't raise any political issues in our conversation, I was able to assess his enormous interest in 'î and knowledge of 'î health issues. This interest and knowledge underlies the Castro's government accomplishments in health and education. 
Cuba, for all its other faults and drawbacks, is in the forefront in both fields when compared to other Latin American countries. And in some areas, it is on par with the United States. This progress, however, has been hindered by the unnecessary and ineffective embargo against the country, a situation that has cost the United States materially. In addition, the embargo has hurt U.S. prestige among Latin American governments, which consider it a violation of a fellow Latin nation's rights and sovereignty. 
There is no doubt that political pressure from the powerful Cuban exile community in Florida has been an important factor in maintaining the U.S. embargo. However, the descendants of that immigrant generation have now a more nuanced view of the Cuban regime. In particular, they have seen the damage caused by decades of antagonism between both countries 'î and are eager for friendlier relations between them. 
While Cubans have always been clear about their admiration for the American people 'î which I have observed first hand during my visits to the island 'î the embargo has fostered more hate and mistrust of the U.S. government than of the Cuban government among Cubans. 
If votes in the UN General Assembly are a test, no country in the world now supports the embargo. President Barack Obama has wisely eased restrictions on travel to the island by Cubans and their descendants. This policy should be followed by an intense exchange of scientists, doctors, artists and ordinary citizens. The effect would be dramatic in neutralizing the atmosphere of antagonism and should be followed by the rapid lifting of the embargo and the complete normalization of relations between both countries.

This exceptionally enervating election is almost over but its political and social implications will last into the future, even if, as expected, Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton. 
The conditions that created this shocking national event will continue regardless. 'Trumpism,' if not the disgraceful Trump himself, will remain part of the Republican party 'î and, of course, he still has a slight chance of winning. Clinton, for her part, has some dangerous goals in the Middle East and toward Russia and China 
Both the successful uprising in the far right Republican party and the failed but nearly successful liberal uprising in the center-right Democratic party shocked the ruling establishments of both organizations. Who guessed the American people were so upset with the status quo? The government had mentioned nothing about it beforehand. The two parties had said and evidently knew nothing. The corporate mass media was silent. 
Those to the left of the Democratic party were surprised as well but they had long been publicly critical of the conditions that finally drove much of the predominantly white working class and sectors of the poor, middle class and millennials to demand a new deal from their respective two political associations. 
The biggest cause is a capitalist economic system that privileges the top 10% at the expense of the bottom 90%, particularly those in the lower 70%. A lesser but real factor is America's continual warfare. Why else does the white working class behind Trump tolerate his call for peace with Russia as Clinton becomes ever more threatening to Moscow? Another cause is the extreme dislike of Clinton by Republicans that allows misogynist Trump to treat so outrageously the first woman presidential candidate of a major party. 
For 40 years the U.S. working class has increasingly experienced lower wages and benefits as well as fewer jobs at all due to the free trade and neoliberal policies of the ruling class and its business component. Hardest hit are workers without a college education or worst of all those who did not graduate from high school. This writer is old enough to remember when white students who left high school at 16 without a diploma were employed fairly quickly, and when they were fired got another job I also know young college graduates today (with large student debts) in low paying retail or other jobs no matter how energetically they seek more remunerative positions. 
White Anger 
Various studies indicate that the white working class is especially disturbed by the lack of jobs and better pay. An article titled 'The Great White Nope' by Jefferson Cowie in the (November-December) issue of Foreign Affairs notes: 
''¶. According to a recent analysis published by the Brookings Institution, poor Hispanics are almost a third more likely than their white counterparts to imagine a better future. And poor African Americans 'î who face far higher rates of incarceration and unemployment and who fall victim far more frequently to both violent crime and police brutality 'î are nearly three times as optimistic as poor whites. Carol Graham, the economist who oversaw the analysis, concluded that poor whites suffer less from direct material deprivation than from the intangible but profound problems of 'unhappiness, stress, and lack of hope'¶.' 
'A stunning U-turn in the fortunes of poor and working-class whites began in the 1970s, as deindustrialization, automation, globalization, and the growth of the high-technology and service sectors transformed the U.S. economy. In the decades since, many blue-collar jobs have vanished, wages have stagnated for less educated Americans, wealth has accumulated at the top of the economic food chain, and social mobility has become vastly harder to achieve. 
'Technological and financial innovations have fostered economic and social vitality in urban centers on the coasts. But those changes have brought far fewer benefits to the formerly industrial South and Midwest. As economic decline has hollowed out civic life and the national political conversation has focused on other issues, many people in 'flyover country' have sought solace in opioids and methamphetamine; some have lashed out by embracing white nationalist rage. As whites come closer to becoming a plurality in the United States (or a 'white minority,' in more paranoid terms), many have become receptive to nativist or bigoted appeals and thinly veiled promises to protect their endangered racial privilege: think of Trump's promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and his invocation of an unspecified bygone era when the United States was 'great,' which many white Trump supporters seem to understand as a reference to a time when they felt themselves to be more firmly at the center of civic and economic life.' 
Trump And Russia 
Trump has said he wants to create a better relationship between the U.S. and Russia, and that as president he would engage President Vladimir Putin about this matter. He has also remarked that there is no proof yet that that the Russian government is responsible for hacking a Democratic party computer and that of John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman. Both included some embarrassing Emails from Clinton that were distributed by WikiLeaks, including the contents of her 'secret' speeches to Wall Street and other venues. 
I agree with Trump on the matter of improving relations with Russia (although there is no telling what a Trump presidency would actually do 'î and a reversal is hardly impossible for such a an individual) and the lack of proof that the Russian government hacked the Emails. 
Anti-Russia Clinton 
The Clinton campaign has turned Trump's comments on Russia into its main target. On Oct.20, the day after the third and last debate, the New York Times reported that if she wins the election 'she will enter the White House with the most contentious relationship with Russia of any president in more than three decades, and with a visceral, personal animus toward Vladimir V. Putin, its leader'¶. In a reversal of political roles, Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate, is the one portraying Mr. Putin as America's newest archenemy'¶. 
'Much of the Democratic foreign policy establishment has become as hawkish as Mrs. Clinton on the subject of Russia, a view that seems almost certain to outlast the campaign. Privately, some of her longtime advisers are already thinking about what mix of sanctions, diplomatic isolation and international condemnation they might put together if they take office to deal with Mr. Putin and the fragile economic state he runs, an update of the 'containment' strategy that George F. Kennan formulated for President Harry S. Truman in 1947.' 
That strategy was the basis of the Cold War. Who wants a new Cold War 'î this time between two capitalist countries with massive arsenals of nuclear weapons? And we suspect that Clinton's real goal is regime change in Moscow. 
In general Clinton is recognized as a war hawk. As secretary of state she argued with President Obama about taking greater military action against the government of Syria and conviced him to bomb and invade Libya. She plans to be tougher on both Russia and China. 
Regarding the allegations of Russian hacking, Nation contributing editor Stephen F. Cohen, a longtime Russia expert, said Oct. 18: 'In fact no actual evidence for this allegation has been produced, only suppositions or, as Glenn Greenwald has argued, 'unproven assertions.'' 
He noted that MIT expert, Professor Theodore Postol, has written that there is 'no technical way that the U.S. intelligence community could know who did the hacking if it was done by sophisticated nation-state actors.' 
Cohen suggested, 'the charges, leveled daily by the Clinton campaign as part of its 'McCarthyite Kremlin-baiting' of Donald Trump, are mostly political.' He also pointed out it is far from clear that the Kremlin actually favors Trump, despite Clinton's campaign claims.' 
Trump's Disgraceful Campaign 
Trump's campaign has been the most disgraceful in U.S. history, replete with climate change denial, outrageous conspiracy theories, allegations against Muslims and Mexicans, frequent lies, outright racism, America-first nationalism, distrust of immigrants, false accusations of ballot rigging and extreme contempt toward his opponent, among other failings. It finally took a video of Trump bragging about his of sexual harassment of women to do him in. 
If Clinton wins, it will be an advance for the United States to finally elect a woman president. She remains a powerful part of the anti-liberal Democratic center right wing and a servant of Wall Street but has pledged to fight for some of the liberal policies advocated by her primary rival Sen. Bernie Sanders. She did so to defeat him, of course, and her efforts in this case will be superficial. 
A Clinton presidency will be haunted by the Republican party and by defeated Trump and his constituency of millions of fanatics who think 'crooked Hillary' belongs in prison. 
Much depends on the composition of the post-election Congress. It's doubtful the Democrats can win the House given the large number of gerrymandered GOP seats 'î a product of Republican control of so many state legislatures. . But there is a possibility Democrats will gain a majority in the Senate. This will make a difference in terms of the Supreme Court and other matters that do not require House approval. If both houses of Congress remain in the hands of the right wing very little can be done 
Assuming Trump is defeated, the temporarily displaced Republican leadership will largely return to power after making concessions to his devoted followers. After that it's probably going to be total war against the Clinton government for the next four years, even worse than the GOP's sabotage during the nearly eight years of gridlocked Obama's leadership.

(4) Representative democracy 
(5) Overt minority dictatorship 
The present society oscillates between (4) and (5), i.e. between overt minority rule and covert minority rule camouflaged by a fa√ßade of token democracy. A liberated society would eliminate (4) and (5) and would progressively reduce the need for (2) and (3). . . . 
In representative democracy people abdicate their power to elected officials. The candidates' stated policies are limited to a few vague generalities, and once they are elected there is little control over their actual decisions on hundreds of issues 'î apart from the feeble threat of changing one's vote, a few years later, to some equally uncontrollable rival politician. 
Representatives are dependent on the wealthy for bribes and campaign contributions; they are subordinate to the owners of the mass media, who decide which issues get the publicity; and they are almost as ignorant and powerless as the general public regarding many important matters that are determined by unelected bureaucrats and independent secret agencies. 
Overt dictators may sometimes be overthrown, but the real rulers in 'democratic' regimes, the tiny minority who own or control virtually everything, are never voted in and never voted out. Most people don't even know who they are. . . . 
In itself, voting is of no great significance one way or the other (those who make a big deal about refusing to vote are only revealing their own fetishism). The problem is that it tends to lull people into relying on others to act for them, distracting them from more significant possibilities. A few people who take some creative initiative (think of the first civil rights sit-ins) may ultimately have a far greater effect than if they had put their energy into campaigning for lesser-evil politicians. At best, legislators rarely do more than what they have been forced to do by popular movements. 
A conservative regime under pressure from independent radical movements often concedes more than a liberal regime that knows it can count on radical support. (The Vietnam war, for example, was not ended by electing antiwar politicians, but because there was so much pressure from so many different directions that the prowar president Nixon was forced to withdraw.) If people invariably rally to lesser evils, all the rulers have to do in any situation that threatens their power is to conjure up a threat of some greater evil. 
Even in the rare case when a 'radical' politician has a realistic chance of winning an election, all the tedious campaign efforts of thousands of people may go down the drain in one day because of some trivial scandal discovered in his (or her) personal life, or because he inadvertently says something intelligent. If he manages to avoid these pitfalls and it looks like he might win, he tends to evade controversial issues for fear of antagonizing swing voters. If he actually gets elected he is almost never in a position to implement the reforms he has promised, except perhaps after years of wheeling and dealing with his new colleagues; which gives him a good excuse to see his first priority as making whatever compromises are necessary to keep himself in office indefinitely. 
Hobnobbing with the rich and powerful, he develops new interests and new tastes, which he justifies by telling himself that he deserves a few perks after all his years of working for good causes. Worst of all, if he does eventually manage to get a few 'progressive' measures passed, this exceptional and usually trivial success is held up as evidence of the value of relying on electoral politics, luring many more people into wasting their energy on similar campaigns to come. 
As one of the May 1968 graffiti put it, 'It's painful to submit to our bosses; it's even more stupid to choose them!'

Elections in the United States are far and away the most expensive in the entire world. In 2012, the Federal Election Commission reported that $7 billion was spent on the presidential campaign. By the time the ink is dry on the 2016 election, the number will likely be even higher. American voters take for granted that political campaigns provide value that allows them to choose the candidate that best represents their ideology and policy positions. But, is this really the best system? Is it even a good one? 
The astronomical cost of campaigns in the U.S. prohibits all but a small handful of individuals with the celebrity and access to obscene sums money the realistic opportunity to compete. It should be no surprise that the two finalists for president in 2016 are both multi-millionaire oligarchs. Even so, they are dependent on raising hundreds of millions of dollars from big business and other special interests. 
Is it reasonable to expect that after such a process the winner of the election will be able to represent the interests of the average citizen rather than the super-wealthy elite individuals and corporations whose patronage allowed them achieve victory at the polls? 
A recent Princeton University academic study disputes this notion. Martin Giles and Benjamin Page write that statistical measures demonstrate that elites and business interests have an impact on policy directly correlated to their wealth, while the average voter has no discernible impact on policy at all. The influence of regular citizens is so low, the authors argue, that it would be inaccurate to characterize the American political system as a democracy. 
As greater economic power necessarily translates to greater political power, a reasonable remedy to the situation would be to decrease inequality in the United States. If inequality was drastically rolled back to a level closer to that found after the end of WWII 'ì through massive taxes on wealth, income and capital gains, along with the abolition of inheritance 'ì perhaps the conditions would exist for fair elections based on competitive campaigns. 
But absent such a drastic realignment of the politico-economic system, are there better possibilities for American citizens to elect officials that represent their interests? The nation has seen that Barack Obama's promises in 2008 to represent 'hope and change,' to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, close Guantanamo, operate transparently, limit domestic surveillance and reform taxes were, in reality, little more than hot air. 
What if instead of being allowed to create his own narrative, a summary of his undistinguished record as an lawyer from elite universities and corporate-friendly record state representative and politician was what voters had to guide their expectations of how he would govern? 
Perhaps the U.S. could look to Cuba, where the Revolutionary government 'ì facing unrelenting subversion and destabilization for decades by its imperial neighbor to the north 'ì has managed to eliminate money from politics entirely. At the municipal level, candidates spend no money and do not campaign at all. Instead, voters are presented with short biographies to reference in determining who they believe would better represent them. 
As the U.S. prepares for its latest electoral spectacle in a few weeks, I offer sample bios for the two presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, based on what they may look like if they were running for office in Cuba . ***

What will Donald Trump do if he loses the elections in a week and a half from now, as most polls indicate? 
He has already declared that he will recognize the results 'ì but only if he wins. 
That sounds like a joke. But it is far from being a joke. 
Trump has already announced that the election is rigged. The dead are voting (and all the dead vote for Hillary Clinton). The polling station committees are corrupt. The polling machines forge the results. 
No, that is not a joke. Not at all. 
This is not a joke, because Trump represents tens of millions of Americans, who belong to the lower strata of the white population, which the white elite used to call 'white trash'. In more polite language they are called 'blue collar workers', meaning manual workers, unlike the 'white collar workers' who occupy the offices. 
If the tens of millions of blue-collar voters refuse to recognize the election results, American democracy will be in danger. The United States may become a banana republic, like some of its southern neighbors, which have never enjoyed a stable democracy. 
This problem exists in all modern nation-states with a sizable national minority. The lowest strata of the ruling people hates the minority. Members of the minority push them out of the lower jobs. And more importantly: the lower strata of the ruling majority have nothing to be proud of except for their belonging to the ruling people. 
The German unemployed voted for Adolf Hitler, who promoted them to the 'Herrenvolk' (master people) and the Aryan race. They gave him power, and Germany was razed to the ground. 
The one and only Winston Churchill famously said that democracy is a bad system, but that all the other systems tried were worse. 
As far as democracy is concerned, the United States was a model for the world. Already in its early days it attracted freedom-lovers everywhere. Almost 200 years ago, the French thinker, Alexis de Tocqueville, wrote a glowing report about the 'Democratie en Amerique'. 
My generation grew up in admiration of American democracy. We saw European democracy breaking down and sinking into the morass of fascism. We admired this young America, which saved Europe in two world wars, out of sheer idealism. The democratic America vanquished German Nazism and Japanese militarism, and later Soviet Bolshevism. 
Our childish attitude gave way to a more mature view. We learned about the genocide of the native Americans and about slavery. We saw how America is seized from time to time by an attack of craziness, such as the witch hunt of Salem and the era of Joe McCarthy, who discovered a Communist under every bed. 
But we also saw Martin Luther King, we saw the first black President, and now we are probably about to see the first female President. All because of this miracle: American democracy. 
And here come this man, Donald Trump, and tries to rip apart the delicate ties that bind American society together. He incites men against women, whites against blacks and hispanics, the rich against the destitute. He sows mutual hatred everywhere. 
Perhaps the American people will get rid of this plague and send Trump back where he came from 'ì television. Perhaps Trump will disappear like a bad dream, as did McCarthy and his spiritual forefathers. 
Let's hope. But there is also the opposite possibility: that Trump will cause a disaster never seen before: the downfall of democracy, the destruction of national cohesion, the breaking up into a thousand splinters. 
Can this happen in Israel? Do we have an Israel a phenomenon that can be compared to the ascent of the American Trump? Is there an Israeli Trump? 
Indeed, there is. But the Israeli Trump is a Trumpess. 
She is called Miri Regev. 
She resembles the original Trump in many ways. She challenges the Tel Aviv 'old elites' as Trump incites against Washington. She incites Jewish citizens against Arab citizens. Orientals of eastern descent against Ashkenazis of European descent. The uncultured against the cultured. The poor against all others. She tears apart the delicate ties of Israeli society. 
She is not the only one of her kind, of course. But she overshadows all the others. 
After the elections for the 20 th Knesset, in March 2015, and the setting-up of the new government, Israel was overrun by a band of far-right politicians, like a pack of hungry wolves. Men and women without charm, without dignity, possessed by a ravenous hunger for power, for conspicuousness at any price, people out for their own personal interest and for nothing else. They compete with each other in the hunt for headlines and provocative actions. 
At the starting line they were all equal 'ì ambitious, unlikable, uninhibited. But gradually, Miri Regev overtakes all the others. All they can do, she can do better. For every headline grabbed by another, she can grab five. For every condemnation of another in the media, she gets ten. 
Benyamin Netanyahu is a dwarf, but compared to this bunch he is a giant. In order to remain so, he appointed each of them to the job he or she is most unsuited for. Miri Regev, a rude, vulgar, primitive person became Minister of Culture and Sports. 
Regev, 51, is a good-looking woman, daughter of immigrants from Morocco. She was born as Miri Siboni in Kiryat-Gat, a place for which I have deep feelings, because it was there that I was wounded in 1948. Then it was still an Arab village called Irak-al-Nabshiyeh, and my life was saved by four soldiers, one of whom was called Siboni (no connection). 
For many years, Regev served in the army as a public relations officer, rising to the rank of Colonel. Seems that one day she decided to do public relations for herself, rather than for others. 
Since her first day as Minister of Culture, she has supplied the media with a steady stream of scandals and provocations. Thus she gradually overtakes all her competitors in the Likud leadership. They just cannot compete with her energy and inventiveness. 
She declared proudly that she sees her job as the elimination of all anti-Likud people from the cultural arena 'ì after all, 'that's what the Likud was elected for.' 
All over the world, governments subsidize cultural institutions and creative people, convinced that culture is a vital national asset. When Charles de Gaulle was the President of France, he was once approached by his police chiefs with the request to issue an arrest warrant for the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, because of his support for the Algerian freedom fighters. De Gaulle refused and said: 'Sartre too is France!' 
Well, Regev is no de Gaulle. She threatens to withdraw government subsidies from any institution that publicly opposes the policy of the right-wing government. She demanded the cancelation of the program of an Arab rapper who read from the works of Mahmoud Darwish, the adored national poet of the Arab citizens and of the entire Arab world. She demanded that all theaters and orchestras perform in the settlements in the occupied territories, if they want to keep their subsidies. 
This week she won a resounding victory when Habima, the 'national theater', agreed to perform in Kiryat-Arba, a nest of the most fanatical fascist settlers. Indeed, no day passes without news of some new exploit by Regev. Her colleagues explode with jealousy. 
The basis of Israeli Trumpism and of Miri Regev's career is the deep resentment of the Oriental 'ì or Mizrahi 'ì community. It is directed against the Ashkenazim, the Israelis of European descent. They are accused of treating the Orientals with disdain, calling them 'the second Israel'. 
Since those recruits of Moroccan descent saved my life near the birthplace of Miri Regev, I have written many words about the tragedy of Mizrahi immigration, a tragedy of which I was an eye-witness from the first moment. Many injustices were committed by the established Jewish population against the new immigrants, mostly without bad intentions. But the greatest sin of all is rarely mentioned. 
Every community need a sense of pride, based on its past achievements. The pride was taken away from the Mizrahim, who arrived in the country after the 1948 war. They were treated as people devoid of culture, without a past, 'cave-dwellers from the Atlas mountains'. 
This attitude was a part of the contempt for Arab culture, a contempt deeply embedded in the Zionist movement. Vladimir (Ze'ev) Jabotinsky, the right-wing Zionist leader and forefather of the Likud party, wrote in his time an article entitled 'The East', in which he expressed his disdain for Oriental culture, Jewish and Arab alike, because of its religiosity and inability to separate between state and religion 'ì a barrier to any human progress, according to him. This article is rarely mentioned nowadays. 
The Oriental immigrants came to a country that was predominantly 'secular', non-religious and Western. It was also very anti-Arab and anti-Muslim. The new immigrants understood quickly that, in order to be accepted in Israeli society, they must get rid of their traditional-religious culture. They learned to distance themselves from everything Arab, such as their accent and their songs. Otherwise it would be difficult to become part of the country's new society. 
Before the birth of Zionism 'ì a very European movement 'ì there was no enmity between Jews and Muslims. Quite the contrary. When the Jews were expeled from Catholic Spain, many centuries ago, only a minority immigrated to anti-Semitic, Christian Europe. The vast majority went to Muslim lands and was received with open arms all over the Ottoman Empire. 
Before that, in Muslim Spain, the Jews achieved their crowning glory, the 'Golden Age'. They were integrated in all spheres of society and government and spoke Arabic. Many of their men of letters wrote Arabic and were admired by Muslims as well as Jews. Maimonides, perhaps the greatest of Sephardic Jews, wrote Arabic and was the personal physician of Saladin, the Muslim warrior who vanquished the Crusaders. The ancestors of these Crusaders had slaughtered Jew and Muslim alike when they conquered Jerusalem. Another great Mizrahi Jew, Saadia Gaon, translated the Torah into Arabic. And so on. 
It would have been natural for Oriental Jews to take pride in this glorious past, as German Jews take pride in Heinrich Heine and French Jews in Marcel Proust. But the cultural climate in Israel compelled them to give up their heritage and pretend to admire solely the culture of the West. (Eastern singers were an exception 'ì first as wedding performers and now as media stars. They became popular as 'Mediterranean singers'.) 
If Miri Regev were a cultured person, and not merely a Minister of Culture, she would have devoted her considerable energy to the revitalization of this culture and giving back pride to her community. But this does not really interest her. And there is another reason. 
This Mizrahi culture is totally bound up with the Arab-Muslim culture. It cannot be mentioned without noticing the close relationship between the two for many centuries, during which Muslims and Jews worked together for the advancement of mankind, long before the world heard of Shakespeare or Goethe. 
I have always believed that restoring pride was the duty of a new generation of peace-lovers that will arise from among the Mizrahi society. Lately, men and women from this community have reached key positions in the peace camp. I have high hopes. 
They will have to fight the present culture minister 'ì a minister who has nothing in common with culture, and a Mizrahi woman who has no Mizrahi roots. 
I hope for a Jewish-Mizrahi revival in this country because it can advance Israeli-Arab peace and because it can strengthen again the loosened ties between the different communities in our state. 
As a non-religious person I prefer the Mizrahi religiosity, which has always been moderate and tolerant, to the fanatical Zionist-religious camp that is predominantly Ashkenazi. I have always preferred Rabbi Ovadia Josef to the Rabbis Kook, father and son. I prefer Arie Der'I to Naftali Bennett. 
I detest Donald Trump and Trumpism. I dislike Miri Regev and her culture.

More water under the bridge. Am I imagining it or was it clear last year that the public was ready to abandon politics as usual, itself a repudiation of the Democratic and Republican parties? But here we are again. 
Millions of words have been written about the two most disliked candidates in presidential history, and why not? They are dislikable. And they are the best candidates the two parties could produce. The two parties that the public had shown strong signs it was willing to repudiate. 
Clinton and Trump are the cream that rose to the top, each deserving to lead their parties and the parties each deserving to have them. Who best to lead the 99% into a more equitable society, the billionaire who brags about being rich or the billionaire-in-training? Now we know where we are but before that water went under the bridge there was a third way. The one Sanders didn't take. 
He knew, given the rigged system, that he could only get attention running as a Democrat. That was smart. He pledged not to mount an independent run and to eventually support whoever became the nominee. That was smart. Let's say whatever happened after that surprised even him. 
It soon became apparent that the traditional candidates from both parties couldn't draw flies. Trump created all the excitement on the right and Sanders did the same on the left. Trump's message was that you're all chumps because you're not like me. Sanders' message was that you're all chumps because the deck is stacked against you. 
Somewhere along the line Sanders realized that his new party was hitting below the belt, the belt being the dividing point above which the expected favoritism towards Clinton would show, and below which that favoritism manifested itself as outright hostility towards him, like he was from a different party (a partial truth), like he was stealing her show. He was. 
Because he's smart, he saw this no later than the rest of us. As many people have suggested, he had ample grounds to rescind his promise not to run outside the party as an independent. He of course didn't, but I don't think we're justified in reading too much into this although many outsiders have. 
What presently interests me is a thought experiment: What would have happened if Sanders had said yes to Jill Stein's offer of heading the Green Party ticket? She did offer this, and since this is only a thought experiment, let's further suppose that Ms. Stein would have been willing to step away from the second spot in favor of Elizabeth Warren. 
That's a lot of supposition for two people who are now enthusiastic supporters of HRC (and by default WJC), and wouldn't have wanted to play the role of spoilers, at least in Sanders' words. He said he didn't want to end up like Ralph Nader. That's a helluva thing to say. 
He might also not want to end up like Ramsey Clark, or Daniel Ellsberg, and we know how he feels about Chelsea Manning, Julian Assange, and Edward Snowden. Both Sanders and Warren assiduously avoid the left position on US foreign policy. This is not inconsequential because there's only two policies, domestic and foreign. Even space fits neatly into the second category. 
Maybe they avoid criticizing US foreign policy because they're smart, as in, it's the smart thing to do. They are politicians and smart enough to know that Americans are not ready to see their country demilitarized, and that's understating things. If they have any qualms about US hegemony they're keeping it to themselves. 
Still, that leaves domestic policy in the age of the aggrieved debt-ridden worker, underpaid and overworked if fortunate enough to be working and insecure at that. It's already been discounted by worldwide planners that the gap between the haves and the have-nots will be widening, with consequences for future generations. Few of the planners see it as their mission to try to halt or reverse this predictable consequence of neoliberal globalization. Rather the financial and military planners seek to manage it to their advantage, most recently 'The Future of the Army' report put out by the Atlantic Council. 
This would be a good time to recall a study done in 2013, the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report: 
Two generations ahead, future extrapolations of current wealth growth rates yields almost a billion millionaires, equivalent to 20% of the total adult population. If this scenario unfolds, then billionaires will be commonplace, and there is likely to be a few trillionaires too 'î eleven according to our best estimate. 
There's a new word in there for us. The wealth of the capitalist class will race away from the worker class like a receding star. 
Back to our gedanken. Let's put Sanders (and Warren) into the debates. Their right-leaning foreign policy wouldn't even be noticed. I don't think too much has to be said about their advantage on everything else. You can't tell people you're for them unless you're of them, and both Trump and Clinton are distinctly not normal people leading normal lives. Trump plays king in the castle and Clinton has had secret service protection for the last one-third of her life. 
Would it have been close? Opinions vary but for two reasons they are beside the point. One, even if a losing proposition it carries the fight to the enemy by seizing upon a seminal moment in American history 'î the point at which the people no longer trusted anything from above that was holding them down. 
Two, it didn't come close to happening. Water under the bridge.

November 3 rd is around the corner. This day of the year may or may not mean something to you. I consider it is a sad day for poetry. On this day 13 years ago the poet of Dagestan, Rasul Gamzatov, left our world. Born on September 8, 1923, Gamzatov is not only the 'People's Poet of Dagestan', he is the poet of the people who love poetry, nature, home, language, and beauty. In his prolific writings, Gamzatov showed that if we know the place where we come from intimately, we will have enough stories to tell for the rest of our lives. He taught us that it is only by telling stories and paying attention to others' stories that we truly live. From the remote villages and treacherous mountains of Dagestan, Gamzatov wrote poems and stories whose words are like loaves of bread to feed the hungry. His rhythms like raindrops falling on the endless deserts of the deprived souls. His depth and clarity like clear spring waters from the melting snows of the mountaintops of Dagestan. Some of his poems turn me into a bleeding red rose, a singing wind on a long lonely night, a thunder loudly objecting every form of oppression on this planet. Others silence my vocal cords and sets free a stubborn tear hanging on the corner of my eye. With his stories, I turn into a bird, into a short-lived wild flower on the side of a mountain rock, into a shiny distant star on a silent and cold winter night. Is it a coincidence that Gamzatov died in 2003, the same year Iraq, the land of poetry and beauty, was occupied and turned into rubble and ashes? 
The poet arrived to this world in the Avar village of Tsada in the north-east Caucasus. The name of the village means 'fire' in the Avar language, which reflects his own poetic fire that was neither tamed nor domesticated nor put out throughout the 80 years of his life. His poems capture the human soul that is like nature: powerful yet also fragile and delicate in other ways. As children of nature, we are capable of doing so much, yet Mother Nature can crush our arrogance in a blink of an eye. Gamzatov understood our delicate existence that can easily be crushed by the cruel rocks of reality. Yet our only bet is on our souls that enable us to fly high and far away. Reminding us of our strengths and weaknesses, he wrote: 'Hit a bird with a stone, the bird dies. Hit a stone with a bird, the bird dies.' 
The son of the well-known bard, Gamzat Tsadasa, Gamzatov from the early years of his youth showed an extraordinary passion for Avar stories, myths, oral traditions, village songs, and everything the people of the mountains cherished and held dear and sacred. His intellectual character is best captured in a version of an old saying that many mountain peoples worldwide recite: 'One should only kneel down in two cases: to drink clear water from a spring, or to smell a wild flower.' This profound expression reminds us of the role of the intellectual in a world where everyone and everything is up for sale. Intellectuals can only kneel down to drink from the spring water of knowledge; or to smell a wild flower whose scent would set their imagination free. If we kneel down for any oppressive power even once, we may forever be cursed, crippled, paralyzed, and perhaps never able to stand up on our feet again. Gamzatov tells us that he first picked the seeds of poetry from his mother's songs in the cradle. He picked the fire of poems from his father who loved reading and writing poetry, in addition to working long and harsh hours in the fields. From an early age, he was determined to capture the stories of his people to show the world that poetry transcends languages, human differences, and all artificial borders. He once recalled his father, Tsadasa, reacting to one of his early poems: 'if you rummaged in the ash, you might find at least a glowing amber.' 
I am sad to report that there is an embarrassing absence of the translations of Gamzatov's writings, particularly in the English language. This negligence is itself a form of censorship of works that may potentially humanize and change how we think about other people and cultures who inhabit our planet. Great works of literature from other places are not only censored by banning them, but even more so by silencing them, by refusing to translate them in the first place. Marginalization is the worst form of censorship and intellectual assassination. Likewise, choosing what gets translated into a certain language and what gets marginalized is a form of shaping and constructing the historical memory of a place according to whims of those who own the money and means of knowledge production. But since the 'politics of translation' is not the subject of this article, I will spare you more details lest I distort this poetic atmosphere. To commemorate the 13 th anniversary of Gamzatov's death, I would like to take you on a journey in one of his most poetic books of all time titled My Dagestan . The book, originally written in the Avar language, was first translated into Russian in 1967. Since then the book has been translated into many languages. For those interested, the only English translation I was able to find is one from 1970, published by Progress Publishers in Moscow. In this article, I will use the Arabic translation first published in Damascus, Syria, in 1984, to share with you some of the countless gems Gamzatov leaves us with in this masterpiece. 
From the very opening of the book, Gamzatov treats the reader as a 'guest' who, upon entering his home, shall hopefully leave as a long-lasting friend. He opens it with what he titles 'Instead of an Introduction'. From the early pages, the poet creates a harmony between writing and his beloved Dagestan. He writes that ideas and emotions are like mountain guests: they come without invitations, without prior notice, and there is no way for us to hide or escape from them when they arrive. In the mountains, there are no 'important' or 'unimportant' guests. The youngest of guests are equally important and honored even more than the oldest person in the household, simply because they are guests . We receive guests at the doorstep without asking them 'where are you from?' We take them to the center of the house and seat them on the pillows, near the fireplace. Gamzatov adds that guests in the mountains appear suddenly and unexpectedly, but they never surprise us, because we are always waiting for them. We wait for them every day, every hour, and every minute. And 'like a mountain guest, the idea of this book came to me.' Elsewhere he writes: 'I want to write a book in which not the language follows the grammar, but the grammar follows the language.' 
Quoting from his notebook, the poet shares with us how in Kolcata (formerly Calcutta) India, while visiting the house of Rabindranath Tagore, he saw a drawing of a bird that doesn't exist in reality. That bird was first drawn in Tagore's imagination. Yet if Tagore hadn't had seen and observed so many different birds that do exist, he would have never been able to draw his own bird. Gamzatov calls it 'Tagore's bird'. To him, this is how writing about the self, the place you love, and the others is also done. In fact, originality and original thinking, in a sense, are like Tagore's bird: they are unique and never seen before. Yet they can only be created after seeing and observing so many different types of birds that do exist in reality. This is why, Gamzatov insisted that his book be titled My Dagestan , because just like the bird he saw in Tagore's house was 'Tagore's bird', so is the Dagestan in the book 'Gamzatov's Dagestan'. It is not, he adds, because Dagestan only belongs to him, but because the way he sees, imagines, and perceives Dagestan is different than any other person on earth, especially when seen through the eyes of transient visitors and tourists. In this sense, Gamzatov reminds us that our homes, our languages, our mountains, and everything we love dearly need a lifetime to be known and a lifetime to be forgotten. 
Later he writes that everything around us is potentially a piece of gold or silver. But silver and gold don't mean anything in themselves. What is important is that the crafter has skilled hands to turn them into something meaningful and beautiful. This is precisely how the stories we hear, see, and experience in this world can be turned into meaningful writings. Here he cites a phrase he once saw engraved on an old jar that read: 'the most beautiful jars are made from clay. The most beautiful poems are written with simple words.' 
On a different page, he reminds young writers that writing takes so much patience and perseverance. He then cites a phrase he once read on an old door in one of Dagestan's villages which read: 'Don't break the door! It can be opened with its key!' This, to him, is the type of patience a young writer needs to learn how to open different doors through different words, different styles of writing, and through patience. He advices young writers that rather than asking for a specific topic to write about, they should ask for a set of eyes that can recognize and capture topics worth writing about. In this way, the poet is telling writers that instead of thinking of themselves as 'magicians' who can change the world in one piece of writing, they are really more like farmers who plant the seeds of their alphabet not knowing on which hearts and minds they shall fall and grow into new wild lives. Gamzatov then goes on to remind us that just as it is hard to determine whether it is the feelings that generate music or is it the music that generates feelings; it is equally hard to determine whether it is the writer who produces the writing or the other way around. 
Gamzatov's appreciation for poetry and writing that spring out of the deepest point of knowing the self after demolishing all walls with others is deeply connected to the Avar culture and myths. He shares that the Avar people have an old myth stating that the poet was created 100 years before the world was created, as though they are saying that had the poet not participated in creation, our planet would not have been as magnificent as it is. This is why poets and writers must never compromise themselves. The only way to do so, he writes, 'is to always be yourself in every single word you write.' As usual, the poet draws on a village tradition to illustrate the point. He cites the tradition of mountain villagers who, before entering a wedding, usually ask: 'is this gathering complete, or do you still have a space for me?' The wedding holders usually respond: 'Come on in if you are you !' And 'in this book,' Gamzatov writes, 'I want to prove that I am me !' 
In a section titled 'Genius', the poet writes that even if humans get to know all the secrets on this earth, nobody will ever know what 'genius' really is, what is its source, how is it shaped, and how does it grow over time. Genius people are also different from one another, for if they were similar, they would cease to be called so: 'I have seen so many faces like my father's face, but I have never recognized in any of them the genius like that of my father,' he writes. He then adds that, fortunately, genius is not inherited, for if it was, it would be like a royalty passed from one royal family to another, from one rich family to another. Indeed, 'it is not unusual for an idiot to be born out of a wise person, nor a child of an idiot to turn out wise.' 
In the second part of the book Gamzatov begins another journey to introduce us to his love and attachment to his hardly known mother tongue, the Avar language. To him, this deep love and connection with this language is precisely what makes him able to appreciate every other language, land, mountain, plain, and valley on this planet. He shares that a poet can and should in fact be able to speak to all people, regardless of their languages. For Gamzatov, the destinies, dreams, and pains of all people can be carried in a single heart‚Äîthe heart of the poet. Yet poets don't actually write poems for each single heart on the planet, nor do they write for every single love, every single smile, or every single teardrop. Poets write about themselves only. But it is only when the boundaries between the self and the other are demolished that the poet will be able to at once write for nobody and for everybody. 
Perhaps not surprisingly, following a long chapter on the 'mother tongue', as My Dagestan nears its end, Gamzatov dedicates a good part of the book to mothers and how the first lullabies and songs they sing to us shape and provide us with enough love and inspiration to face the harshness of this world for the rest of our lives. He wonders whether 'cowards' are those people whose mothers didn't sing for them in their cradles. Perhaps those who betray others are people who have forgotten the songs their mothers sang for them in their cradles. The poet is deeply aware of what it means when a mother‚Äîor any loving woman in her place‚Äîsings for us our earliest songs and tunes. He writes 'a mother's song is the beginning and the source of all human songs. It is the first smile and the last tear.' Considering how the early tunes and the early songs shape our intellect, cognitive abilities, and literary and poetic selves, it is significant that Gamzatov would emphasize the role of mothers' songs that teach us how to be in love with everything beautiful around us. He writes that there are songs mothers sing when the child is born, others they sing when they lose their child, and yet others they keep singing long after their beloved children are gone. In this way, poetry for Gamzatov is neither words nor music nor the human senses that receive them. It is the encounter between language, music, and the senses. After reciting numerous stories about the power of singing that, to him, far exceeds the power of swords and weapons, he insists that songs can change the world and save countless lives. His words in this section remind me of a very old saying from the Arabian Peninsula which asks us to beware of mingling with people who don't love music; to beware of people who don't like and don't know how to sing. 
Gamzatov left us in 2003 but he left behind a treasure in the form of poetry. He left us prose even more poetic than his poetry. From the magical and tough mountains of Dagestan, he wrote in the Avar language and spread so much love and poetry for so many people who aspire to be human before anything else. After all, one of his favorite inscriptions he saw on a tombstone read: 
He was no sage, 
But bow to him: 
He was a man. 
In My Dagestan , Gamzatov writes that the people of the mountains were asked why they built their villages so far away, blocked from others, and secluded by all these mountains. Villagers were told that in residing in these mountains, it is impossible to reach them given the dangers of the road. The villagers responded: 'Good friends will reach us without worrying about these dangers. As for bad friends, we don't need them anyway!' Gamzatov was keen throughout his life to record many inscriptions he came across on old doors, gates, tombstones, and mountain rocks in Dagestan's villages. In two memorable inscriptions about 'guests' he writes: 
Come, hillfolk, please knock! 
We're well. If we're not, 
Your coming shall cure us! 
* 
Don't knock, don't rouse the household, 
You who pass this way! 
If good you bring us, enter! 
If mischief, go away! 
It is hard to end an article about Gamzatov as much as it was hard to start it. I first read My Dagestan when I was an undergraduate student at the University of Baghdad. This year I had to reread its 550 pages to share some of its vivid images and poetic jewels with you. As soon as I finished rereading the book, I felt sad and empty, because the poet indeed fulfilled his promise: I entered the book like a passing mountain guest and here I am leaving it as a dear friend to the poet and to all the remote villages and people he writes about. Gamzatov's mountains and magical scenes resemble northern Iraq and remind me of everything and everyone I loved and loved me. It reminds me of all the letters I have received over the years from friends who cared about me, friends who betrayed me, and others who still renew their vows of love and friendship in my life every day. 
I close the book with great sadness because, in a strange way, it makes me ask the same old questions always secretly lurking in the back of my head or circulating in my bloodstream like an incurable virus: do we only realize the meaning of all things, people, and places that we love after they are no more? Do we always put the people, things, and dreams that truly matter to us aside like storing a precious item in a closet, hoping naively to come back one day to find them as we left them? Is it the big paradox of life that we don't master the art of living until it is nearly time to depart? After all, Gamzatov himself was quoted saying shortly before his death: 'My life is a draft I wish I had the time to revise.' Oh, my friends, I know I should not end on this sad note. Perhaps to truly celebrate Gamzatov's poetry and life, I should end exactly as he ended My Dagestan in the translation I am holding now in my hands: 'We are finished. It is time to separate. And, as they say, we shall meet again. God willing.'

To view photojournalist Orin Langelle's new online photography exhibit If Voting Changed Things is to accept a challenge. Don't expect a passive viewing of simple, aesthetically pleasing photography or a mindless stroll through apolitical eye candy. The challenge should be apparent from the title of the exhibit: It is a riddle, a fragment, an incomplete sentence awaiting your contribution. To view his display is to realize that there is no single way to finish the statement. Langelle invites you to see the complexity of the world through his lens, but to draw your own conclusions about the meaning of the images. 
If Voting Changed Things'¶ people would vote. They don't. Only 58% of eligible voters did in the last presidential election. Recent polls indicate that the majority of Americans feel disenfranchised by the 2016 presidential election process and candidates. They aren't proud or hopeful about the outcome, and half of Americans feel helpless. There is no emphasis on issues that matter to them. Election discussion centers around voting for the least worst candidate, which makes civic duty seem like an exercise in self-denial and a concession that our aspirations are not achievable. 
Of course, the counter is that if you don't vote, you're giving someone else the power to make decisions for you. But that perspective ignores the range of opportunities for civic engagement and citizen action: Protesting, demonstrating, picketing, civil disobedience, rallies, striking, tax resistance, boycotting, sit-ins, sabotage, hacking and DDoS, tree-sitting, resistance, law-breaking, insurrection, rebellion, revolution. Langelle's images of protest activity outside of national conventions in 1972 and 2004 raise the question of whether voting, and the electoral circus that accompanies it, is about citizen empowerment or an explicit and ceremonial abdication of power by citizens to a status quo elite. Which leads to the observation that'¶ 
If Voting Changed Things'¶ they wouldn't let us do it. Chomsky wrote that 'The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum'îeven encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there's free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of debate.' Photographs from 1972 and 2004 capture moments outside of the system, beyond the framing of the acceptable discourse. Protesters explicitly reject governmental authority through symbols, slogans, caricatures, and artwork. The elephant pulling a coffin through Miami's city streets conveys a belief that political parties are leading us to death and destruction. The black hoods and orange jump suits communicate that protesters in Boston, relegated to a 'Free Speech Zone,' have become the equivalent of Guantanamo Bay detained terrorist suspects. It is not accidental that the media ignores or minimalizes these displays of collective action. In 2016 delegates'îthe people who were there (never mind viewers at home)'îat the Republican and Democratic National Conventions remarked that they were unaware that protests were occurring outside throughout. Langelle deftly illustrates that this is because authorities have increasingly managed and marginalized protest behavior. Which demonstrates that'¶ 
If Voting Changed Things '¶ this exhibit wouldn't be necessary. For many, Langelle's work will be shocking because it lays bare the evolution of policing and the criminalization of dissent. Photos of the 1972 demonstrations include arson, sabotage, gratuitous nudity, and graffiti that challenges, 'Amerika'îLove it or Destroy it,' and yet not a single police officer is identifiable among the activists. The activists are in the streets, climbing in trees, occupying fields and grassy lawns, neighborhoods and parks. Contrast this with images of Boston Police in 2004, appearing ready for war in riot gear; armed with Tasers, guns, clubs; a menacing and ubiquitous presence atop scaffolding towers. Because of new draconian laws, protesters have been herded into holding pens of chain link fences and razor wire, surrounded by surveillance cameras, concrete, and girders. The photos depict a world that has changed drastically in thirty years, and which has militarized against, marginalized, and narrowly framed the acceptable boundaries of citizen dissent. Moreover'¶ 
If Voting Changed Things '¶ it wouldn't contrast so distinctly with other forms of citizen action. There is a humor and a vibrancy to 'the people' that Langelle juxtaposes brilliantly against the sterile and colorless state apparatus. There is a diversity of skin color, age, gender among the protesters. Their slogans are racy, their clothing is colorful and fun. They wield musical instruments, engage in 'guerilla theatre' and share poetry. They engage in property destruction with irony'îwearing clogs as they break windows and asking through their graffitti with (gallows) humor if the protest restraint area represents the 'Land of the Free?' Their defiance comes in the form of patches, to be worn on the derriere, sold by a young girl in a flowered dress. They paint their faces and wear straw hats. 
The stark reality of the state is helmeted, with dark gray protective gear and weapons to enforce compliance. The only colors are the red, white, and blue banners and flags that appear more as a hypocritical challenge to the popular movements than a patriotic display. It is evident that Langelle sees a dour system that is oppressive and lifeless. Voting is a part of that system, a reinforcement of its values and an affirmation of the status quo. 
If Voting Changed Things'¶ marginalized groups wouldn't be in the streets. The electoral process in America has produced and validated a government that has produced institutional racism, militarization within and from our society, mass incarceration, crippling debt, perpetual war, homelessness, a failed health care system, eroding and ineffective education, and environmental exploitation. If Voting Changed Things'¶ we wouldn't have a 1%. We wouldn't allow the .01%, 16,000 Americans , to hold as much wealth ($9 trillion) as 80 percent of the nation's population 'ì some 256,000,000 people 'ì and as much as 75 percent of the entire world's population. We wouldn't allow the five largest white landowners in America to own more agricultural land than all of black America. If Voting Changed Things'¶ demographics wouldn't be used as a basis for electoral strategies. We would vote away the cleavages that exist across generations, racial and cultural groups, religious affiliations. But we don't, because we can't. 
If Voting Changed Things'¶ would we be where we are? The work of Orin Langelle may offer you a lens from which to answer that question. Or to find your own conclusion to the sentence.

I was in London last weekend to view a play, 'When Nobody Returns' . The play, written by British writer Brian Woolland and jointly produced by Border Crossings , Ramallah-based Ashtar Theatre and Central School of Speech and Drama , tells the Greek myth known to many of Homer's 'Odyssey'. 
A mixed cast of Palestinian and British actors delivered a riveting performance of poise and emotion. The classic text rings clear, intermingled with language we all hear every day and sets that those who know the story of the Palestinians and other downtrodden people will recognise. The inspired use of a variety of sets at differing levels and positions in the theatre in Acklam Village brings the audience right in to the heart of the drama and to the edge of their seats. The analogues nature of the occupation of Ithaka, at the heart of the play, to the story of Palestinians is clear throughout the play yet not overwrought. 
I have been a supporter of the Palestinian cause since I became politically aware in my mid-teens. This political awakening took place during the post 9-11 atmosphere in the west. As US troops draped the star spangled banner upon and tore down Saddam's statue in Firdos Square in Baghdad, the Second Intifada raged across the Palestinian territories and Israel. As Bob Dylan once sung, we live in a political world. As I have learnt more about the history and present occupation of Palestinian land, I have always felt that the drive to free the Palestinians of their daily humiliation at the hands of the Israeli state should be led by Palestinians. 
Productions such as 'When Nobody Returns' provide agency to Palestinians, those Palestinians who still grind out an existence on the West Bank and Gaza and those in exile, to tell their fundamental story of loss, betrayal, despair and ultimately strength. You can see and feel this strength in the performances of the actors. Iman Aoun, who plays Penelope Odysseus's wife, exudes the granite and dignified exterior of a war widow who refuses to be beaten by the occupier. 
If you are a supporter of Palestinian human rights and enjoy theatre of the highest quality I encourage you to plan a visit to see 'When Nobody Returns' and the prequel 'This Flesh is Mine' (drawn from Homer's The Iliad).

'But I'm desperate to work.' With these words Daniel Blake enters the consciousness of the UK taxpayer. Until he utters them, imploringly in a fictional branch of a Newcastle jobcentre office, he is simply another scrounger. To earn acknowledgment, let alone respect, he must first confirm his status as a consumer of the services on offer. 
It doesn't matter. He is a carpenter by trade, shown knowledgeably inspecting the components of his labour in the film's early scenes. He lives alone, he had a heart attack, his doctors say he cannot work. He must sign on for benefits, but is found capable of work under the benefits regime which assesses a man with a history of cardiac arrest as being suitable for production, on the basis that he can reach for his top pocket and walk fifty metres unaided. 
Describing the benefits system in the UK as Kafkaesque would be to miss the point. Bureaucracy was a byword for existential trauma in Kafka, not something designed by people to be deployed, en masse but in the shadows, against whole swathes of people in their jurisdiction. The benefits system as we know it in the UK assumes its beneficiaries to be immoral scroungers, perniciously ripping off the hardworking people who deign to pay tax in marginal constituencies prayed on by political image consultants who attended the ancient universities. More crucially, when the response to this film focuses on the efficiency of the system and not the devastation it wreaks on people, it affirms the distance which makes misery so profitable in today's United Kingdom. 
So when Daniel Blake is denied the benefits package which should cater to people who cannot work because of ill health, he must sign up to Jobseekers allowance, a necessary condition for which is the admission that a person is liable for their productivity. Consequently he must spend as much time looking for work as he is deemed able to work 'ì in this case thirty five hours a week. He attends a CV building workshop, run by a man as reputable and cogent as any of the political consultants who ministered Tony Blair's ascendancy to the Northern masses, but with an accent which lets you know he's provincial. The whole film begs us to ask who is its intended audience. 
The vagaries of Blake's experience beyond this are unexceptional, to any of the audiences which might be viewing this film. Those who have to directly interact with the system are likely to face hurdles in attending a screening in enough numbers to generate the kind of social upheaval people might want to see 'ì the cinema being a costly, far-away form of entertainment for many in the UK. As for those who, like the author, work with people affected by the system; assisting in claims, trying to maintain mental health throughout the months of assessments, writing letters and making calls to dispute the lies peddled by private companies tasked with diminishing the number of claimants? They have likely seen worse cases than that of Daniel Blake 'ì people driven past the boundaries of mental anguish they thought possible, and left there while an appeal or a 'mandatory reconsideration' hangs in the balance. 
Instead this film seems to have hit its mark when the Times , Rupert Murdoch's broadsheet flagship in the UK, announced that it 'might change things.' Any portrayal of the benefits system which could be of use to the libertarian right, or even mainstream media, must now be so skewed as to be unrecognisable to those who have seen it. 
Increasingly the benefits system, and the people whose lives it lays waste to as politicians demand, at the behest of their constituents, operates behind a glass wall whose opacity just clouds the identities of the damned. As Daniel Blake is plucked from the obscurity of fiction to represent an entire system, proudly taking his singular place on behalf of the many, the others are ignored. 
Women like Katie 'ì the university student and mother who spent two years trying to raise a family in a homeless hostel before moving the length of the country to an unfamiliar city in search of difference when it became obvious there was nothing but repetition where she knew. Women like Sheila, the jobcentre assistant who interprets Katie's desperation the only way anyone can anymore: as aggression, and earns the ultimate mark of British social disdain: silent disapproval. Was this the life she envisaged as a child? What does she think when she goes home? Does she suppose she might be the crux of an evil system? Women like Ann, the kindly woman at the jobcentre who faces disciplinary action from bosses for the crime of helping a man fill in a benefits claim, even if it means transgressing silly rules. What does she think about having to stay at the jobcentre? Does she see any hope for the future? What would she think about the film's implication that Sheila, her colleague, is all that is wrong with the world? 
None of these stories are explored. Katie's moments of angst are some of the film's most affecting 'ì including her admirable restraint in not maiming Daniel Blake when he insists 'she doesn't have to do this,' when he walks into the brothel she works at because there is manifestly no other option. In this, Daniel's apotheosis to everything the Right needs him to be. A man, who built things with his hands, and still has more good, old-fashioned morals than sense. Without these things he would be just another scumbag, pilfering the system of their hard-earned pennies. He even goes to the trouble of containing his grief at the death of his partner 'ì a woman whose mental illness he tolerated for years until her apparent suicide. She is at peace now, and so are the Tories 'ì safe in the knowledge that the UK's premier leftist filmmaker has gifted them the fictional icon they always wanted but did not know they could have: Daniel Blake is the facsimile of masculinity, working class nostalgia and British reserve that they might see in themselves, if they needed to bother to look. 
Fortunately for them, they don't 'ì unfortunately for the rest of us, there's only the Labour Party between now and an eternity of their rule.

The mothers referred to in the title of Brit Bennett's folksy novel are witnesses, observers but also communal biddies who narrate much of story from a self-righteousness of assumed superiority. They're members of the Upper Room, a black church in San Diego, who clearly do much good helping the sick and the elderly. There's no place for error (especially regarding sexual morality) in their eyes, which means that they are particularly hard on the younger generation that has grown up with a less rigid sense of promiscuity. Their harsh condemnation is strong enough to destroy the very church that has been the center of their friendships, their religious community. Since the time frame for the novel is contemporary'îor quite recently'îthe women referred to in the title also represent a dying breed, presumably the final generation with such religious dedication. I felt the same way about The Mothers as I did about J. D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy (which I reviewed in CounterPunch , September 16 th ): another pocket of America that has been left behind. Hard to tell if this is reason for celebration or consternation. 
The adult male of major consequence in the story is Robert Turner, known 'around Upper Room as the man with the truck, a black Chevy pickup that had become Upper Room's truck because of how often Robert was seen driving from church, an arm hanging out of the window, the truck bed filled with food baskets or donated clothes or metal chairs.' He's a good man, who can always be relied upon to lend a helping hand. Even Robert himself believed that his truck 'had turned things around for him,' because his wife blew her brains out, and his truck made it possible for him to help others and get his mind off his own pain. No explanation is ever provided for the woman's suicide. 
The Upper Room is successful, a bulwark for part of the city's black population. Pastor Sheppard and his wife, Latrice (known as 'First Lady') are models of decorum. The story's focus is not race but morality, though an occasional glib remark does place the story within a racial context. The first family's son, Luke, is, indeed, the stereotypical wild young man, whose father is a preacher. Luke is described as 'reckless,' followed by a remark that brings up race: 'Black boys couldn't afford to be reckless,' his mother told him. 'Reckless white boys became politicians and bankers, reckless black boys became dead.' The major theme of the novel is extended a few paragraphs later. 'A daughter grows older and draws nearer to her mother, until she gradually overlaps like a sewing pattern. But a son becomes some irreparably separate thing.' That's some rather nice writing. 
Bennett illustrates her observation by shifting the narration to Luke and Nadia Turner, motherless because of her mother's suicide. Luke was a star athlete, but a broken leg on the football field ended his scholarship and, hence, his academic career. He's returned home, to live with his parents, and assist in their work at the Upper Room. Nadia, who is several years younger, has been awarded a scholarship to go to Michigan, but she earned the scholarship because of her intellect, not for athletics. The predictable occurs. Luke gets Nadia pregnant, which might not be such an awful thing were it not for Luke's religious upbringing. 
Thereafter, the story probes numerous layers of guilt involving the characters already mentioned, in part because of Nadia's decision to have an abortion. She leaves her community to attend the university in Michigan, then goes on to earn a law degree. Luke stays in San Diego, holding down various positions that are mostly unrewarding. Both of them were friends, at separate times, of another young woman named Aubrey, and the lives of all three become gnarled together, mostly because of deceit. It takes a number of years before the errors of the past become known to all three of them, and'îwhen it does'înew jealousies and additional guilt emerge. All three lives are also entwined with the Upper Room, which largely becomes a cage for them, not the liberating force it might have become. 
The attitudes toward religion in The Mothers ('Anyone knows a church is only as good as its women, and when we all passed on to glory, who would hold this church up') are conflicting, largely because of the times in which we live. The novel has appeared with an enormous amount of hype that I'm not certain it deserved. The story itself peters out well before you turn the final page.

Even amidst the bluster, lies, and anger unleashed by the presidential election'îthe last of these captured this morning in a vivid photo essay in Germany's leading daily, the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung , I often hear the calming strains of one of Johann Sebastian Bach's most famous arias, 'Sheep May Safely Graze.' The first duty of the president, we are often told by the candidates, is the security of the American people. In this piece Bach presents a sonic vision of safety secured by enlightened leadership. 
Above a pulsing B-flat drone whose static harmony conveys contented repose, a pair of pastoral recorders waft over an untroubled landscape: this is artfully managed nature with no suggestion of the horrors of the wild, nowhere the menace of danger. There are no armies or terrorists massing beyond the verdant hills. When, after two bars of instrumental introduction, the drone breaks into a gentle gait it is not done to worry the listener but to lift the eyes and ears over welcome fields. In just four graceful measures Bach has painted an expansive, tranquil canvas. Over these Bachian fields floats the soprano voice of Pales, the Roman deity of shepherds: 
Sheep may safe graze, When watched over by a good shepherd. Where rulers govern well Peaceful calm is to be felt That makes a country happy. 
Ruling your subjects well is like animal husbandry: manage the flock, be concerned, competent and watchful. Let your charges nibble and roam but never too far towards unknown perils. 
We may have the notorious Bundy gang getting let off federal conspiracy and weapons charges after its attempt at an armed takeover of huge stretches of the American landscape (the rogues gallery of the exonerated is to be seen in New York Times today is even scarier than the just-mentioned photo essay in the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung ), but Bach's aria nonetheless projects a pursuit of happiness that can readily be transposed from its premiere on February 23 rd , 1713 in a castle banqueting hall set in the green hills of central Germany to the Land of the Free on October 28, 2016 little more than a week before Election Day. Heard today, the aria confirms that what Americans want most is a nice lawn; a pet or two; and to be left in peace. 
In the three century's since its first performance, the aria has proliferating in myriad transcription and arrangements, the most famous of them by the visionary Italian piano virtuoso F erruccio Busoni . Given the work's graceful beauty, it is not surprising that in one version or another it's a favorite at weddings: having played the thing countless times for nuptial proceedings, I can assert that its popularity indicates that security and stability, not passion, are the enduring foundation of the institution of marriage, and in turn therefore of American democracy. The aria text's praising male rule remains unheard in these instrumental transcriptions, and the wedding pairs remain blissful ignorant of it. 
This Best-of-Bach track comes from the so-called Hunt Cantata (BWV 208), composed for the thirty-first birthday of Duke Christian of Saxe-Wei√üenfels. He loved music, but even more, hunting, a proclivity captured by Bach in his musical tribute. At his own wedding the previous year, Duke Christian's distant relative, the mighty Saxon Elector and Polish King, Frederick the Strong, had had his jewelers, the miraculous Dinglinger brothers, fashion a lavish hunting cup that he presented to the couple and which is now to be marveled at in Dresden's famous museum, the Gr√ºnes Gew√∂lbe. Bach's music was meant to match this level of opulence and artifice, one which even minor German princes like Christian enjoyed. 
But hunting was not just a topic for artistic representation at the hands of a Dinglinger or a Bach. It was a dangerous pursuit, especially since prevailing attitudes towards gun control and safety were almost as primitive as those held in America today. Musicians were not spared mortal danger. The Wei√üenfels male alto and writer on music Johann Beer, who was also among the funniest and most prolific of early German novelists, got himself killed in a hunting accident with one of the dukes. His colleague David Heinrich Garthoff, who must have known Bach, came to the court as an oboist (an instrument often deployed for accompanying the hunt) but got his lower lip shot off while hunting birds. Garthoff was a versatile musician and became the court's lipless organist. 
Lucky for us, Christian didn't hand Bach a blunderbuss and command him into the fields when the composer visited the court for the Duke's birthday festivities in 1713, otherwise we might have been deprived of hundreds of cantatas, the Goldberg Variations, the B-Minor Mass and heaps of other hits and only a few misses. 
Both Countess Clinton and Sir Donald are all for protecting the gun rights of hunters, so this is a movement both could get behind. Indeed, it's any gun-lover's dream, even if he didn't'îor doesn't'îhave a tenth of the arsenal of the Duke. At the aria's start the obligatory horns fill the banqueting with tales of the day's daring escapades taking down massive bucks beaten towards the hunting party so that the Duke could dispatch these trophies-to-be at close range. Then the goddess Diana, sung by the famed German soprano Pauline Kellner (also likely Anna Magdalena Bach's teacher), unleashed her own dazzling vocal firepower, shoots off a coloratura melisma on the very first syllable before listeners can even figure out what she was referring to, though the hunting horns have left little doubt: 'Hunting is the passion of the gods,' she sings, following that blast with a line that would make a fine bumper sticker for a Ford F-250 pick-up on the back roads of Upstate New York: 'Hunting is for heroes.' Even if there had been rather too much of the above-mentioned collateral damage among Wei√üenfels musicians, this is bracing bipartisan defense of guns and game. While the aria may indeed represent Hilary's views on the second amendment, she could use more than a little of the panache of Bach's Diana in getting her message out. 
Before we leave this hugely entertaining cantata let's listen quickly to the political lessons to be gleaned from the first aria of Pan, the god of shepherds and a lusty rustic type who, like Donald, you wouldn't want to sit next to in first-class. Bach makes his Pan a fun-loving, loose cannon of a bass, who goes off half-cocked claiming that he would make a worthy leader: like Bill Clinton and Donald Trump , this libertine purports to have great erotic powers, and it can only be assumed he thinks these will help him as head-of-state. A pair of brash oboes starts bragging even before the voice enters, making the absurd claim that 'A Prince is the Pan of his country.' The bass sounds-off through a lurching gigue that suggests too much drink. After his opening comic comparison, one about as funny as imagining Donald Trump in the Oval Office, Pan goes on to make a decent point of political theory, though hardly an original one since the analogy between a ruler-less country and a headless body politic was a trope of the time: 
Just as the body without the soul Cannot live or control itself, So a country is a cave of death When it no longer has a head and prince And therefore lacks its best part. 
Pan holds resolutely to long notes on 'live' and 'rule' but then tumbles drunkenly down from them as he runs out of breath. On entering the mortal cavern with its minor shadows and chromatic crags, the drunk goes dark, only brightening just before the close when he remembers that he is after all 'the best part''îthe happy head to the nation's body. It's a raucous, rambling stump speech worthy of you-know-who. 
Sumptuous entertainments like this cantata drained the ducal coffers in Wei√üenfels such that many of the court's musicians'îincluding some of Bach's own in-laws'îwere eventually owed years of unpaid salary. As a result, the duchy was dissolved by the higher-up royals in Dresden. Even the marital Hunting Cup came back to the giver. If you believe the gun-loving Trump, a similar fate awaits the Americans once the Chinese debt-holders come calling'îand not just to bag a couple of big horn sheep for their trophy wall.

The Obama regime's gingerly kid gloves treatment of white Christian terrorists is a policy that foresaw the acquittal of the Bundy gang. 
The gang was able to conduct an armed occupation of the Oregon Wildlife Refuge in full view of the nation because they won their 2014 armed confrontation with the feds at the Bundy ranch in Nevada. Armed federal marshals retreated from the battlefield and no one was arrested until this year when Bundy pere, immune in Nevada, made an unwise visit to Portland. 
Charging the terrorists with the narrow and whimpy crime of conspiring to keep refuge workers away from their jobs was difficult to prove because their own boss ordered them to stay away and none tried to go to work. 
A federal government determined to fight terrorism could have escorted employees through the terrorist lines with as much firepower as deemed necessary if that was the crime they intended to prevent. But, as in Nevada, law enforcement did not even order the terrorists to drop their guns (Oregon offers an 'open carry' invitation) or threaten them with arrest. 
Instead, Obama's DOJ policy was to wait them out, perhaps because white lives really matter. That meant the prosecution could not present evidentiary proof of actual weapon threats and intimidation by the terrorists and dictated their weak charge. The armed terrorist at the off refuge roadblock had to charge an entire platoon of law enforcement officers after his vehicle tried to run them down before they shot and killed him. 
The acquittal of the armed occupiers is a consequence of our political culture. As transmitted by the media ( The Oregonian avoided calling it what it was and used neutral labels like 'standoff') that culture has decided that white Christians can't be terrorists'ì a designation reserved for blacks and Muslims. So a jury that reflected a statewide and not a Portland constituency evidently kicked out its lone dissenter and then quickly acquitted can be assumed to have acquired this cultural norm. 
And we in Oregon suffer from a frightened governor Brown whose response to the verdict was, 'The occupation of the Malheur Reserve did not reflect the Oregon way of respectfully working together to resolve differences' 
Isn't that special?

In a speech before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee earlier this year, Hillary Clinton, who vehemently opposes the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement warned against anyone who tries to 'to shut down debate, especially in places of learning like colleges and universities.' Her concern, of course, was with reassuring pro-Israel students that she stood behind them as they battled efforts to criticize Israel from the left. 
It is certainly sportsman-like of Clinton to be open to debate, but the reality is that the free exchange of ideas on campus is currently under assault, not from the left but from the right. Consider the following incident from here in Ohio. 
On September 21, the Case Western Reserve University Radical Student Union showed a documentary titled ' ,' which is available to all members of the university community through the Kanopy streaming service. Today, the RSU stands accused by the , a nonprofit pro-Israel group, of engaging in an 'antisemitic expression' that 'condoned terrorism,' simply for showing the film in public. One radical student critical of Israel's policies likened the climate of fear on the CWRU campus with respect to this issue as akin to be 'stalked.' 
The RSU decided to host the film to raise awareness and in the words of its president, Gabriel Murcia, to give 'voice to people who don't have a voice.' Although some 100 people attended the screening, the RSU decided at the last minute not to have a formal discussion after the film when an email raising the specter of antisemitism emerged from the president of a pro-Israel student group. 
I have watched this film at least four times now. There is absolutely not one shred of evidence of antisemitism in it if by that word we mean hatred or discrimination against the Jewish people. The film does, however, take Israel to task for engaging in a dishonest campaign of public diplomacy. These efforts have tended to cast the problem in Israel/Palestine in terms of terror instead of territory, and have made it seem as if Palestinians are on the whole just prone to violence instead of people with legitimate grievances about displacement and dispossession of land. 
After the movie, a student fellow of the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA), a group formed after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, noted that though 'every student on this campus is entitled to express their opinion' the film was biased and 'unacceptable to be presented by a student organization at our university.' The her opposition to the BDS movement and argued that the president of CWRU had made opposition to academic boycotts the institution's official stance. 
The student's reference is to a in which the president and provost, like many university administrations across the country, communicated their personal opposition to the academic boycott of Israel following the American Studies Association's endorsement of it. They argued that the boycott compromised academic freedom. Never mind that the academic boycott was set up to help Palestinian scholars achieve academic freedom while under the Israeli occupation. The AMCHA Initiative liked their statement so much that it still links to it on its website. The statement was not, however, the official position of CWRU, simply the personal opinions of its two highest administrators. 
The statement by the CWRU administration and the letter from the CAMERA fellow recall, as I pointed out in a , Edward Said's comment, nearly 40 years ago, that politically speaking, the Palestinian in the United States 'does not exist.' 
I thought the matter was at an end, but to my surprise the about the movie screening. A university administrator who directs a continuing education center dedicated to ' ' condemned the film and the RSU, as if a radical Jewish tradition did not exist. He also implied that faculty drove the group's agenda, implying that the students were not bright enough to think for themselves. The chairman of the board of trustees of the Jewish Federation of Cleveland, Gary Gross, meanwhile, called the film a bunch of 'lies and distortions' without providing any evidence in support of the assertion. In fact, the film is about a policy of using lies and distortions to advance the interests of a foreign government. Gross added that he supports free speech, but then ominously intoned, 'We will follow what's happening on [the CWRU] campus through our partner agency, Cleveland Hillel.' 
The reference to Hillel was not an idle one. Cleveland Hillel just partnered with CWRU on the creation of the new Albert & Norma Geller Hillel Student Center which includes within it classrooms available for undergraduate courses. Some students on the left are dismayed that they are forced to take classes in a building run by a group that offers ' .' 
This incident is part of nationwide trend. Universities all over the country are under surveillance, most famously at the University of California, Berkeley, where a student-led course titled Palestine: A Settler-Colonial Analysis was canceled after AMCHA coordinated with other groups, including CAMERA, to pressure administrators. The course was later reinstated, but the intimidation continues online. An anonymous website called the Canary Mission, established in 2015, targets those on campus critical of the Israeli occupation. The site's main goal is to harass student activists and attempt to block their admission into graduate school. 
If Hillary Clinton really does care about academic freedom, she should step up and publicly condemn the blacklisting of students and faculty concerned about Palestinian human rights. And so should the university presidents who invoked academic freedom as the rationale for their opposition to the ASA's endorsement of the boycott of Israeli academic institutions. These leaders should also learn something from the experience on the Berkeley campus and stop caving in to people who have trouble tolerating a perspective that challenges them to think. 
When I informed Mr. Murcia about his group's inclusion on the AMCHA website he was saddened. As he put it, 'All we did was show a movie.' 
Ted Steinberg teaches history and law at Case Western Reserve University. He is the faculty advisor to the Radical Student Union and the author, most recently, of Gotham Unbound: The Ecological History of Greater New York .

The sun will rise on Wednesday November 9 on a new American landscape, the same way it rose on a new American landscape almost exactly 8 years ago. 
That was the dawn of Obama-time. Millions of Americans had dined delightedly on Obama's rhetoric of dreams and preened at his homilies about the inherent moral greatness of the American people. Obama and the Democrats triumphed at the polls. The pundits hailed a 'tectonic shift' in our national politics, perhaps even a registration of the possibility that we had entered a 'post-racial' era of progressive politics and economics. 
But the realities of American politics don't change much from year to year. After years of Obama, the nation remains bogged down in at least 8 different wars and the national divisions of wealth and resources have grown wider today than they have been at any time since the late 1920s. For many of us, the post-electoral dawn will shine its light on an eerily familiar assemblage of characters: Hillary and Bill, John Podesta and Robert Rubin, Ken Salazar and Cheryl Mills. The same people who engineered the deregulation of the American economy will be back in the control room, ready for another round of looting. 
Few journalistic enterprises have followed the Clintons as closely as CounterPunch. CounterPunch was literally born with the rise of the Clintons in 1993. My first encounter with Alexander Cockburn came in a telephone call in 1992, when Alex rang me up to question me about a story I'd written on Bill's grim environmental record in Arkansas. Over the next 8 and half years, Alex and I wrote about the Clintons almost every week and we never held back. 
Twenty-four years later, we still aren't holding our fire. We've told it straight about the Clintons and Trump and we won't stop. 
Now that the biennial democratic pretense here in the U.S.A. has almost run its course, can we talk about something serious? Like the future of CounterPunch. We can? Good. 
Every year we run a fundraiser. We've been running these end-of-the-year appeals since we went online in 1999, at the ragged end of the first Clinton era. As you know, we're doing one right now. But in all of those years, we've never been as close to the edge as we are right now. Never before have we been 5 weeks into a fund drive and still $25,000 short of where we need to be. 
I won't reiterate grim details. Becky Grant, our business manager all these years, has laid them out for you in stark detail. 
If you've been reading the CounterPunch website or magazine for a while you've no doubt noticed that every year we've continued to offer you the full menu and that the thickness and diversity of the menu continues to grow. Maybe you think we shout 'wolf' only to scare the money out of your pockets. 
Here are the realities of 2016. We shout 'wolf' because the wolves are real. We operate on a razor thin margin. That means that money can get tight for us, very quickly. We're not sitting on big reserves, we literally live check to check, PayPal to PayPal. 
We know that money is tight for many of you, too. These are tough times. For most of the Great Recession never ended. Our readership is higher than it's ever been. We have more donors to CounterPunch than we've ever had, though in smaller and smaller amounts. But if you're passing up your usual check to us at fundraising time, or writing a much smaller check than usual, or postponing your subscription renewal to our CounterPunch magazine, forgive me if I give you an urgent nudge. 
Many websites on the progressive side of the spectrum are cut-and-paste affairs, a mix of columns culled from mainstream newspapers, weeklies, blogs and so forth. Every day our CounterPunch site offers you up to a dozen original articles, and often twenty across our three-day weekend site. 
Just glancing back across recent months, we've run marvelous pieces from Alan Nasser on Hillary Clinton's policy toward the first-strike use of a new generation of nuclear weapons; from Christopher Ketcham on corrupt prosecutors from Coast-to-Coast; from Mark Schuller about Haiti after Hurricane Matthew, from Andrew Cockburn about drone warfare in Obama's Af-Pak wars; from John Pilger on Wikileaks and Julian Assange; Diana Johnstone on Hillary Clinton's bloody foreign policy. 
There's no need to go anywhere else for coverage of the neoliberal/Wall Street onslaughts. Here, week by week, you read Michael Hudson, Paul Craig Roberts, Mike Whitney, Mark Weisbrot, Dean Baker, Ellen Brown, Pete Dolack and Jack Rasmus. 
CounterPunch writers file regularly from Israel, Gaza, the West Bank, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Venezuela, South Africa, India'¶ On the Middle East, indeed, no site offers more resolute, consistent coverage of the monstrous war waged by Israel, the U.S. and Europe on Palestinians' just demands. 
On our site and in our magazine we give you truly original voices: Chris Floyd, Ishmael Reed, JoAnn Wypijewski, Yvette Carnell, Kathy Kelly, Kevin Alexander Gray, Lee Ballinger, Peter Linebaugh, Jennifer Lowenstein, Ruth Fowler, Nancy Schemer-Hughes, Daniel Raventos, Pepe Escobar, Eric Draitser and Margaret Kimberly. I don't have to go on. You're probably familiar with the names. CounterPunch is where the global left comes to air its grievances. 
We're not part of the Twitter Left, spraying tweets into the blathersphere. We still think issues, like oil pipelines, the economy, the climate and the war, are worth more than 140 characters. With the participation of hundreds of CounterPunchers as writers, and hundreds of thousands of CounterPunchers as engaged readers, we've built up CounterPunch as a vital, thoughtful, vivid and above all, radical presence in the U.S. and 'ì about a third of our audience 'ì across the world. 
We can only do this with your financial support. There's no safety net. No waste to prune. Enough said. Your money is our lifeblood. Every dollar you can manage really is vital.

Every day, it seems, we talk about Prison America; the profitable high growth industry that entombs millions of our people'¶ stealing years, often decades, of their lives while destroying families and communities along the way'¶ as we continue to subsidize a vicious, sagging economy built upon death'¶ not life. Though the debate centers largely on the question of why we continue to prosecute and bury mostly young people of color and poverty for drug crimes and other non-violent offenses, the equation often misses a core component of the challenge concerning how to control willful cops'¶ those in uniform and out'¶ who cross the line with mostly unbridled power to dictate who goes to prison and who does not, whose reputation remains solid and whose becomes soiled, and then set about to do whatever it takes to see their view of justice be had. 
In the US, result oriented justice is not new or even creative; it's as old as the frontier sheriff with boundless power to rule with a firm hand to control who got to walk down the streets of Dodge and who did not. Of course, cops plant evidence, coerce statements and entrap folks'¶ that's a given. Torture, rendition and agent stings are very much now the norm. No breaking news here. Ultimately, when all else fails, it's the modern day version of the old school way to ensure 'case closed''¶ another 'victory' for those who not only relish their power but see its arbitrary application as just fine as long as they get their man'¶ or woman. 
It seems most cops, from those directing traffic on the boulevard to the guy in the designer suit before Congress, lose sight along the way that their power is but power on loan'¶ not owned by them to use and do with as they please when their own social, political or 'security ends' justifies their means'¶ or where they seek to lay the groundwork for future employment. 
Once again, this past week, FBI Director James Comey proved that point. 
Although finely polished and experienced, this lifelong Republican cop seems to feel that there's one set of rules for all those he's helped to send to prison and a completely different one for him'¶ one blue book of conduct for all others in the Department of Justice but, apparently, not a volume to be found among the personal library of he who now occupies the Director's desk of the FBI. 
Time and time again, throughout the Clinton email scandal, Comey has proven himself to be not much more than an old fashioned ward healer'¶ but with a badge'¶ desperate for the feel of flesh or to see the flash of bulbs or, perhaps, a novice candidate for political office looking for a hook to, some day, launch his own career. 
FBI Directors do not hold press conferences to discuss or explain why charges have not been pursued against a potential subject of interest or a target of an investigation. They just don't. Inexplicably, he did. 
As a matter of long settled policy, these matters are simply not offered up to the public for Monday morning debate or talking head analysis which can not only tarnish the reputation of persons cleared of criminal wrongdoing but expose investigative sources or techniques that can endanger the reliability of future investigations or the safety of agents. Indeed, legend is the cases where the door to on-going or post hoc litigation leads has been slammed shut, without hesitation, by federal judges for this very reason. 
As well, the all too convenient mass publication by the FBI in this matter of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of its sensitive 302 reports (official FBI case progress memoranda) are simply unprecedented. Indeed, prisoners (and journalists) often spend years litigating access to this material which is challenged by the FBI, every step along the way, with endless technical statutory excuses for keeping it secret; even in cases, long closed, where its release might offer a ray of hope to those perhaps wrongfully convicted or overcharged. 
Most stunning of all however was the cheap political ploy by Comey where but 11 days prior to the election he suggested, in a public writing to Congress, that he had uncovered newly discovered, potentially damning evidence with regard to the Clinton email scandal. The tenor and tone of the Director's insinuation is remarkable, indeed astonishing, given the fact that apparently neither he nor any of his agents had, as of the time of the written press conference, reviewed the material itself. Can anyone say deceitful? 
Even more disingenuous was the timing of this claim which not only rubbed up against firmly rooted and sound DOJ policy but, in fact, swallowed it whole as the Director slobbered away from the political dining table with a scheming smile on his face. 
Although periodically ruptured, by design the mandate of federal law enforcement necessarily excludes witting participation in the political process, let alone becoming ensnarled in it, as an ostensible partisan or one consciously seeking to impact upon it one way or another. That's the job of politicians not cops. 
Indeed, the Department of Justice has, for decades, avoided taking actions that might be viewed as an attempt to influence an election. As noted in a 2012 Justice Department memo ''¶ all employees have the responsibility to enforce the law in a neutral and impartial manner'¶which is 'particularly important' in an election year.' According to Matthew Miller, former Director of the Justice Department's Public Affairs Office, this becomes all the more sensitive, nay, critical as Election Day draws near: 
'Justice traditionally bends over backward to avoid taking any action that might be seen by the public as influencing an election, often declining to even take private steps that might become public in the 60 days leading up to an election.' 
This rule finds firm footing in the position of a host of former and current Attorneys General and senior prosecutors. For example, it has been reported that former AG Janet Reno was 'adamant'¶ anything that could influence the election had to go dark,' as she suspended a politically sensitive investigation'¶ one much further removed in time from Election Day than the most recent blindside, by the FBI Director, just 11 days before the vote to see who will lead this country for the next four years. 
Remarkably, it appears Comey completely ignored the 'preference' of current Attorney General Lynch'¶ his boss'¶ as well as her deputies that he adhere to a well established DOJ policy of remaining silent about on-going investigations and refrain from taking any steps that could influence the outcome of an election . This view has been shared by Republican prosecutors as well. As noted by George J. Terwilliger III, a deputy attorney general under President George Bush, 'There's a longstanding policy of not doing anything that could influence an election.' He added 'Those guidelines exist for a reason. Sometimes, that makes for hard decisions. But bypassing them has consequences.' 
Sadly, Comey's palpable decision to charge full steam ahead and place his own view and reputation before that of the electoral process as so much the ultimate arbiter of what he believes the public should know and not'¶ real or otherwise'¶ on the eve of this election is not sui generis . Although different in approach, and context, he now follows a long and time tested tradition of corrupt and venal FBI directors who have not hesitated to implement personal political agendas ranging from the Palmer raids upon anarchists of the early 20 th century, to the blacklisting and perjury traps of McCarthy , to the murder of black activists under COINTELPRO . 
Comey is many things. He is not however stupid or brash. He had to know that what essentially constituted a vaguely worded personal press release, in the final desperate days of a very ugly campaign, would be seized upon, by an opposing candidate, media pundits and the public, as newly discovered evidence of criminality, even without verification, that might very well alter the course of US history. 
To him, it mattered not that the 'new' emails were as yet unparsed. Nor did he care that their timed release would almost certainly have the consequence, if not the intended effect, to mislead the American people already battered and tired by unprecedented levels of empty rhetoric and unfounded accusations by both sides. 
One can only wonder whether Comey's blindside was simply breathtaking in its carelessness or'¶ like the beat cop who has decided who goes to jail and who goes home'¶ a calculated decision to place his own personal stamp of approval on who he wants to see as his next uber boss. 
The path from street corners or, at times, even Board Rooms to prison cells is not a complicated walk at all. It seems these days the road to the White House is pretty much the same march'¶ just a bit longer and nastier.

It is literally impossible for the world community to get a clear understanding of, and truth about, the Fukushima nuclear disaster. This statement is based upon The Feature article in Columbia Journalism Review ('CJR') d/d October 25, 2016 entitled: 'Sinking a Bold Foray Into Watchdog Journalism in Japan' by Martin Fackler. 
The scandalous subject matter of the article is frightening to its core. Essentially, it paints a picture of upending and abolishing a 3-year attempt by one of Japan's oldest and most liberal/intellectual newspapers, The Asahi Shimbun (circ. 6.6 mln) in its effort of 'watchdog journalism' of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. In the end, the newspaper's special watchdog division suffered un-preannounced abrupt closure. 
The CJR article, whether intentionally or not, is an indictment of right wing political control of media throughout the world. The story is, moreover, extraordinarily scary and of deepest concern because no sources can be counted on for accurate, truthful reporting of an incident as powerful and deadly dangerous as the nuclear meltdown at Fukushima. Lest anybody in class forgets, three nuclear reactors at Fukushima Diiachi Nuclear Power Plant experienced 100% meltdown, aka The China Syndrome over five years ago. 
The molten cores of those reactors melted down to a stage called corium, which is a lumpy hunk of irradiating radionuclides so deadly that robotic cameras are zapped! The radioactivity is powerful, deadly and possessed of frightening longevity, 100s of years. Again for those who missed class, TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company) has no idea where those masses of sizzling hot radioactive goo are today. Did they burrow into the ground? Nobody knows, but it is known that those blobs of radioactivity are extraordinarily dangerous, as in deathly, erratically spewing radioactivity 'who knows where'? 
Fukushima is a national/worldwide emergency that is the worst kept secret ever because everybody knows it is happening; it is current; it is alive; it is deadly; it has killed (as explained in several prior articles) and will kill many more as well as maim countless people over many decades (a description of radiation's gruesomeness follows later on in this article). 
Yet, the Abe administration is talking to Olympic officials about conducting Olympic events, like baseball, in Fukushima for Tokyo 2020. Are they nuts, going off the deep end, gone mad, out of control? After all, TEPCO readily admits (1) the Fukushima cleanup will take decades to complete, if ever completed, and (2) nobody knows the whereabouts of the worlds most deadly radioactive blobs of sizzling hot masses of death and destruction, begging the question: Why is there a Chernobyl Exclusion Zone of 1,000 square miles after one nuclear meltdown 30 years ago, but yet Fukushima, with three meltdowns, each more severe than Chernobyl, is already being repopulated? It doesn't compute! 
The short answer is the Abe administration claims the radioactivity is being cleaned up. A much longer answer eschews the Abe administration by explaining the near impossibility of cleaning up radioactivity throughout the countryside. There are, after all, independent organizations with boots on the ground in Fukushima (documented in prior articles) that tell the truth, having measured dangerous levels of radiation throughout the region where clean up crews supposedly cleaned up. 
The Columbia Journalism Review article, intentionally or not, paints a picture of 'journalism by government decree' in Japan, which gainsays any kind of real journalism. It's faux journalism, kinda like reading The Daily Disneyworld Journal & Times. 
Based upon the CJR article: 'The hastiness of the Asahi's retreat raised fresh doubts about whether such watchdog journalism'î an inherently risky enterprise that seeks to expose and debunk, and challenge the powerful'îis even possible in Japan's big national media, which are deeply tied to the nation's political establishment.' 
Japan's journalists belong to 'press clubs,' which are exclusively restricted to the big boys (and girls) from major media outlets, where stories are hand-fed according to government officialdom, period. It is the news, period! No questions asked, and this is how Asahi got into trouble. They set up a unit of 30-journalists to tell the truth about Fukushima and along the way won awards for journalism, until it suddenly, abruptly stopped. A big mystery ensues'¶. 
According to the CJR article, 'The Investigative Reporting Section [Asahi] proved an instant success, winning Japan's top journalism award two years in a row for its exposure of official cover-ups and shoddy decontamination work around the nuclear plant.' 
Furthermore, according to the CJR article: 'The abrupt about-face by the Asahi, a 137-year-old newspaper with 2,400 journalists that has been postwar Japan's liberal media flagship, was an early victory for the administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which had sought to silence critical voices as it moved to roll back Japan's postwar pacifism, and restart its nuclear industry.' 
And, furthermore, the truth be told: 'In Japanese journalism, scoops usually just mean learning from the ministry officials today what they intend to do tomorrow,' says Makoto Watanabe, a former reporter in the section who quit the Asahi in March because he felt blocked from doing investigative reporting. 'We came up with different scoops that were unwelcome in the Prime Minister's Office.' 
It comes as no surprise that Reporters Without Borders lowered Japan's rating from 11th in 2010 (but one has to wonder how they ever got that high) to 72nd in this years annual ranking of global press freedoms, released on April 20, 2016. 
Koichi Nakano, a professor of politics at Sophia University in Tokyo, says: 'Emasculating the Asahi allowed Abe to impose a grim new conformity on the media world.' 
When considering the awards Asahi won during its short foray into investigative journalism, like Japan's equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize in 2012 for reporting about a gag-order on scientists after the Fukushima disaster and the government's failure to release information about radiation to evacuating residents, now that Asahi has been forced to put a lid on 'investigative journalism' and it must toe the line in 'press clubs,' any and all information about the dangers or status of Fukushima are ipso facto suspect! 
The world is dead silent on credible information about the world's biggest disaster! (Which causes one to stop and think'¶ really a lot.) 
The evidence is abundantly clear that there is no trustworthy source of information about the world's biggest nuclear disaster, and likely one of the biggest dangers to the planet in human history. However, time will tell as radiation exposure takes years to show up in the human body. It's a silent killer but cumulates over time. Fukushima radiation goes on and on, but nobody knows what to do. To say the situation is scandalous is such a gross understatement that it is difficult to take it as seriously as it really should be taken. But, it is scandalous, not just in Japan but for the entire planet. 
After all, consider this, 30 years after the fact, horribly deformed Chernobyl Children are found in over 300 asylums in the Belarus backwoods deep in the countryside. Equally as bad but maybe more odious, as of today, Chernobyl radiation (since 1986) is already affecting 2nd generation kids. 
According to USA Today, Chernobyl's Legacy: Kids With Bodies Ravaged by Disaster, April 17, 2016: 'There are 2,397,863 people registered with Ukraine's health ministry to receive ongoing Chernobyl-related health care. Of these, 453,391 are children 'î none born at the time of the accident. Their parents were children in 1986. These children have a range of illnesses: respiratory, digestive, musculoskeletal, eye diseases, blood diseases, cancer, congenital malformations, genetic abnormalities, trauma.' 
It's taken 30 years for the world, via an article in USA Today, to begin to understand how devastating, over decades, not over a few years, radiation exposure is to people. It is a silent killer that cumulates in the body over time and passes from generation to generation to generation, endless destruction that cannot be stopped!

Donald Trump has stated that, on advice of his lawyer, he will not release his tax returns until his audit is concluded.1 
By contrast, Hillary Clinton has released her federal 1040 returns, (but not her state or possible other returns). Language on her campaign website asserts that she and her running mate 'continue to set the standard for financial transparency.' 
The Clinton returns reveal much information, but they reflect a standard short of full financial transparency. More significantly, the tax reductions the Clintons receive when donating to their foundation and the lower rate of self-employment taxes they paid compared to those who make much less reflect some of what is wrong with the U.S. tax system. Gross income is the gross receipts minus their business expenses and $3,000 of a carried forward capital loss that started in 2008.2 Total federal taxes is their income taxes minus foreign tax credits (for them, only years 2011-13)* plus self-employment taxes and additional taxes due to the Affordable Care Act (higher medicare taxes and taxes on investment income starting in 2013) * For the Clintons, the foreign tax credit came to $160,000 or less each year from 2011-13 and arose from work done abroad. 
For years 2010-2015, the table below shows the Clintons' reported gross income, total federal taxes paid, charitable contributions, and the amount of the latter going to the Clinton Foundation. 
What follows mainly focuses on the Clintons' 2014 tax return. 
Self-employment Income 
Almost all of the Clintons' gross income after deducting expenses ($28,020,811) was derived from self-employment: with the biggest amounts for making speeches (slightly more than $8.7 million made by Hillary and $8.4 million by Bill), consulting ($6.1 million made by Bill,) and writing ($4.6 million made by Hillary.) 
All of their speaking income is paid by The Harry Walker Agency. However, under IRS rules, who paid the agency or to whom they spoke is not disclosed. 
The tax return indicates that $2.125 million of Bill's consulting income, before deducting expenses, was paid by Gems Education. A Wikipedia article describes Gems Education as 'the largest operator of private kindergarten-to-grade-12 schools in the world, [that] as of 2015 has over 70 schools in over a dozen countries'¶' 
In 2010, Bill Clinton 'named GEMS Education a strategic partner of the Clinton Global Initiative .' According to the tax returns, in 2011, for the first time, GEMS Education paid Bill'ì $500,000 raising its payment each year thereafter. 
Laureate Education paid Bill $4,292,475. It is described in the New York Times as 'a network of for-profit schools .' 
In 2010, Laureate hired Bill as its new honorary chancellor. As disclosed on the tax returns, it paid him over $17.5 million from 2010-2015. Bill's visits to Laureate's campuses were described to have 'inspired' students.3 The nature of the advice Clinton provided is not part of the tax return. 
Business Deductions 
Both Clintons took deductions against their self-employment income. These deductions are supposed to be ordinary and necessary meaning they are common and appropriate. Their expenses deducted for airfare, transportation, and hotels came to several times what most people earn at their jobs. 
In 2014, Bill claimed travel expenses of $375,793 for his speaking business, an amount considerably less than the $2,018,050 spent on travel for that business in 2013. By contrast, his total travel expenses for his consulting business for 2013 and 2014 together came to less than $600. 
Hillary's travel expenses for making speeches in 2014 came to $813,842. Another $288,504 was spent on travel for her writing business in 2014. 
Under IRS rules, specific details such as where they went and stayed, and for how long, are not provided. 
Self-employment tax 
Self-employment income is subject to self-employment taxes: social security and medicare taxes paid by the self-employed. In 2014, social security taxes were paid on only the first $117,000 of net income at a rate of 12.4% resulting in a maximum tax of $14,508. The medicare portion which is 2.9% of all net income had no income limits. 
If one adds the Clintons' 2014 self-employment tax to their additional medicare tax under the Affordable Care Act, the total comes to $1,010,090 or 3.6% of their total net self-employment income. 
The Clinton returns show the gross unfairness of the self-employment tax that leaves those with high incomes paying a rate that is much lower than those with significantly less income. 
For example, a person making $30,000 of self-employment income after deducting expenses would pay a self-employment tax of $4,239 which is over 14% of their self-employment income, or more than 3 times the rate paid by the Clintons. 
Clintons' Unearned Income 
From 2011-2014, the Clintons reported no dividend income from stock holdings, only interest income. In 2014, it came to only $25,171. All but $464 was paid by JP Morgan Chase Bank. How their money is invested with the bank is, as allowed by the IRS, not made clear'ì probably in the form of CDs or bonds. 
By contrast, in 2007, the Clintons made over $1 million in interest income and over $90,000 in dividends. All of the latter is reported as coming from trusts. 
In 2007, they also reported over $15 million on the sale of stock held by their trusts. Most sales were for less than $100,000 with only one for slightly more the $250,000. Most sales occurred on or before May 11 reflecting very good timing since this was shortly before the financial meltdown. 
Their stock holdings were diverse. They consisted of holdings in major corporations including Bank of America, Wal-mart, Chevron, Exxon, General Electric, Honeywell, and Lehman Brothers prior to its bankruptcy. 
At first glance, one might see the Clintons as acting upon information that the economy would soon crash, but they may have decided to rid themselves of holdings that might be used against Hillary in her run for the presidency in 2008. 
Reporting no dividends from 2011-2014 probably indicates no re-entry into the stock market after the meltdown, or that they only purchased stocks that paid no dividends. 
There is a huge difference between their total interest and dividend income in 2007 of $1,159,836 with their 2014 interest income of $25,171 and no dividend income. Despite the low interest rates, how could their dividend and interest income have plummeted so much? 
Given the size of their total income all these years, one has to wonder if they have been spending it all or investing it in ways that do not show up on their tax returns.4 
This raises other questions. Have they been making large gifts/political donations or paying large personal legal bills? Have they set up an entity that handles investments and pays taxes on the income generated instead of passing it through to them individually to report on their tax return? 
Charitable Contributions 
Those who usually receive the biggest reduction in their taxes per dollar donated are those with the highest income because they are in a higher tax bracket. Many charitable donors receive no tax reduction because they do not itemize their deductions. In 2014, the Clinton donation to their foundation of $3 million reduced their taxes $1,188,000 'ì39.6% of the money donated, not including a probable savings of state taxes. This level of savings can be viewed as a government subsidy/giveaway to the rich since it reduces the government's revenue and allows the money donated to be used to support and finance the policies of their own foundation. 
In 2014, all but $200 of their remaining charitable contributions, $22,500, went to two churches. From 2010-2015, 2014 was the only year specified contributions went to religious organizations. 
Comparison to Romney 2010 Return 
In 2010, the Romneys reported on their tax return gross income of $21,661,344. Despite a gross income that was $8 million more than the Clintons that year, their total federal tax came to less than 14% of their gross income, $3,009,766'ì over $1,000,000 less than the amount of federal taxes paid by the Clintons. 
The main reason for the Romneys' lower taxes was because most of their income came from investments which were taxed at a lower rate (a policy that began when Bill Clinton was president) while the bulk of the Clinton income was 'earned' income which is taxed at a higher rate. 
Like the Clintons, the Romneys saved on their taxes by making donations. $1.525 million went to their church and over $1.45 million of stock was donated to their own foundation. It in turn made donations to entities including Brigham Young University, The George W. Bush Library, and the Harvard Business School. 4 
Why All of the Above Smells Foul 
The rich are said to be different than most people. One difference is that three of the last four major party candidates for the presidency had their own foundation. This suggests that having a foundation could be a future requirement for being taken seriously as a candidate. 
By releasing their returns, the Clintons have acted with more transparency than Trump. 
Trump may be hiding something, but the Clinton returns raise many questions whose answers should be of concern to voters. 
The Clinton's gross income declined sharply in 2015 from over $28 million in 2014 to $10,745,378. Nevertheless, this 'lower' income could arouse disgust given the levels of poverty in the world and unmet basic needs of millions. 
The low level of taxes the rich pay under the IRS rules allow for the massing of fortunes which normally go untaxed during their lifetimes, except for whatever property taxes they pay on the real estate they own. 
Footnotes 
1.By signing his Form 1040 return, Trump indicated, as stated above one's signature that 
'Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this return and accompanying schedules and statements, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, they are true, correct, and complete .' 
If what he submitted is 'true, correct and complete,' shouldn't he be willing to share his returns with the public even if many lawyers think otherwise. See various views held by some lawyers on this issue at: 
http://lawnewz.com/politics/legal-experts-side-with-trump-it-would-be-totally-stupid-to-release-his-taxes-during-audit/ 
2. The capital loss started in 2008 when the Clintons disposed of a holding they acquired in 2003 of Yucaipa Partnerships showing a loss of $726,761. For some details about it and their relationship to it, see this Wall Street Journal article at: http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123716092427335513 
The Clinton ties to Yucaipa weren't all costly. According to the 2007 tax return, Yucaipa Global Holdings paid the Clintons over $2.75 million. (The relationship between Yucaipa Global Holdings and the disposed Yucaipa Parnerships is not clear to me.) There was no income from Yucaipa during subsequent years reported on a Schedule E where one reports partnership income as had been reported in 2007. 
A Wikipedia article indicates that: 
'Former U.S. President Bill Clinton , a close friend of founder Ron Burkle, was an advisor to Yucaipa. From 2003 to 2006, Bill and Hillary Clintons' tax returns show total Yucaipa partnership income of $12.5 million.'

4. There are no indications on the tax returns that the Clintons invested in real estate. From 2007 through 2015, their property taxes remained around $100,000. The only exception is 2013 when it jumped to $128,098, but then went back down to $104,303 the following year.

I visited Mosul on the day it fell to Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and a small detachment of US Special Forces on 11 April 2003. As we drove into the city, we passed lines of pick-up trucks piled high with loot returning to the Kurdish-controlled enclave in northern Iraq. US soldiers at a checkpoint, over which waved the Stars and Stripes, were shooting at a man in the distance who kept bobbing up from behind a wall and waving the Iraqi flag . 
If there had ever been any sympathy between liberators and liberated in Mosul, it was disappearing fast. Inside the city, every government building, including the university, was being systematically looted by Kurds and Arabs alike. I saw one man who had stolen an enormous and very ugly red and gold sofa from the governor's office dragging it slowly down the street. He would push one end of the sofa a few feet forward and then go to the other end and repeat the same process. The mosques were soon calling on the Sunni Arab majority to build barricades to defend their neighbourhoods from marauders. 
We parked our vehicle near a medieval quarter of ancient stone buildings while we went to see a Christian ecclesiastic. When we got back, we found that our driver was very frightened and wanted to get out of Mosul as fast as possible. He explained that soon after we left a crowd had gathered, recognised our number plates as Kurdish and debated lynching him and setting fire to his car before being restrained by a local religious leader moments before they took action. 
The oil city of Kirkuk was captured at about the same time by the Peshmerga, despite having promised the Americans and Turks that they would do no such thing. Again, there was looting everywhere and I saw two Peshmerga stand in the middle of the road to stop an enormous yellow bulldozer that was being driven off. Instead of slowing down, the driver put his foot on the accelerator so the Peshmerga had to jump aside to avoid being crushed. 
Inside the newly established Peshmerga headquarters, I ran into Pavel Talabani, whose father Jalal Talabani headed the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the political party whose militia now held the city. He stressed the temporary nature of the Kurdish occupation of the city. 'We came to control the situation,' he said. 'We expect to withdraw some of our men in 45 minutes.' 
Some Peshmerga, but not all: 13 years later the Kurds still hold Kirkuk, whose population is Kurdish, Arab and Turkoman, and to which the Kurds claim an historic right saying they have only reversed anti-Kurdish ethnic cleansing by Saddam Hussein. 
By now the rest of the world has forgotten that there was a time when the Kurds did not hold the city. The Kurdish leaders had understood that the US-led invasion and the fall of Saddam Hussein had created conditions of unprecedented political fluidity and it was an ideal moment to create facts on the map, which would become permanent whatever the protestations of other players. 
The current multi-pronged offensive aimed at taking Mosul is producing a similar situation as different countries, parties and communities vie to fill the vacuum they expect to be created by the fall of Isis, just as in 2003 the vacuum was the result of the fall of Saddam Hussein. 
The different segments of the anti-Isis forces potentially involved in seizing Mosul 'ì the Iraqi army, Kurds, Shia and Sunni paramilitaries, Turks 'ì may be temporary allies, but they are also rivals. They all have their own very different and conflicting agendas. Presiding over this ramshackle and disputatious alliance is the US, which is orchestrating the Mosul offensive and without whose air power and Special Forces there would be no attack. 
The Shia-dominated Iraqi government needs to take and hold Mosul, Iraq's main Sunni Arab city, if it is to be convincing as the national government of Iraq. To achieve this, Baghdad's rule must be acceptable to the Sunni majority in the city in a way that was not true when Isis took it in 2014. It needs to establish its rule while it still has full military and political support from the US. 
The Kurds, for their part, want to solidify their control of the so-called 'disputed territories' claimed by both the central government and the Kurdish regional authorities. The Kurds opportunistically used the defeat of the Iraqi Army in northern Iraq by Isis two years ago to take these territories inhabited by both Kurds and Arabs, thereby expanding by 40 per cent the area of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). They know that once Isis is defeated, the Kurds will no longer get international and, above all, American backing to hold this expanded version of the KRG. 
These problems have only begun to surface because Mosul is still a long way from being besieged or even encircled. 
The Shia militia forces are surprisingly calm about being excluded from a military role in the siege. They may calculate that the Iraqi army, if it gets sucked into street fighting, will not be able to take Mosul on its own and will have to look to them for support. The Shia paramilitaries are making up for their lack of participation in the battle for Mosul by sending reinforcements 'ì some 5,000 men, according to reports 'ì to join the Syrian Army in the siege of East Aleppo. 
Turkey wants to be a player and, as a great Sunni power, the defender of the Sunnis of Mosul. To this end, it has soldiers based at Bashiqa, north east of Mosul, and claims to be taking part in the attack. But so far at least, Turkish ambitions and rhetoric in Iraq and Syria have exceeded its performance. Both interventions may be designed to impress a domestic audience which is deluged with exaggerated accounts of Turkish achievements in the government-controlled Turkish media. 
These participants in the struggle for Mosul may be dividing the tiger's skin before the tiger is properly dead. Isis showed that it still has sharp claws when it responded to the assault on Mosul with raids on Kirkuk and Rutbah on the main Iraq-Jordan road. It is fighting hard to slow down the anti-Isis advance towards Mosul with a mix of suicide bombers, IEDs, booby-traps, snipers and mortar teams. But it is unclear if it will make a last stand in Mosul where, at the end of the day, it must go down to defeat in the face of superior numbers backed by the massive firepower of the US-led air forces. 
The likelihood is that Isis will fight for Mosul, the site of its first great victory, in order to prolong the battle, cause casualties and to let divisions emerge among its enemies. But its strategy over the last 12 months has been not to stage heroic but doomed last stands in any of the cities it has lost in Iraq and Syria. 
At Ramadi, Fallujah, Sinjar, Palmyra and Manbij it has staged a fighting withdrawal at the last moment. The same may now happen in Mosul.

TigerSwan is one of several security firms under investigation for its work guarding the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota while potentially without a permit. Besides this recent work on the Standing Rock Sioux protests in North Dakota, this company has offices in Iraq and Afghanistan and is run by a special forces Army veteran. 
According to a summary of the investigation , TigerSwan 'is in charge of Dakota Access intelligence and supervises the overall security.' 
The Morton County, North Dakota, Sheriff's Department also recently concluded that another security company, Frost Kennels, operated in the state while unlicensed to do so and could face criminal charges . The firm's attack dogs bit protesters at a heated Labor Day weekend protest . 
Law enforcement and private security at the North Dakota pipeline protests have faced criticism for maintaining a militarized presence in the area. The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) and National Lawyer's Guild have filed multiple open records requests to learn more about the extent of this militarization, and over 133,000 citizens have signed a petition calling for the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene and quell the backlash. 
The Federal Aviation Administration has also implemented a no-fly zone , which bars anyone but law enforcement from flying within a 4-mile radius and 3500 feet above the ground in the protest area. Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer on the scenes in North Dakota with the Indigenous Environmental Network, said on Facebook that ' DAPL private security planes and choppers were flying all day' within the designated no-fly zone. 
Donnell Hushka, the designated public information officer for the North Dakota Tactical Operation Center, which is tasked with overseeing the no-fly zone, did not respond to repeated queries about designated private entities allowed to fly in no-fly zone airspace. 
What is TigerSwan? 
TigerSwan has offices in Iraq, Afghanistan, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, India, and Latin America and has headquarters in North Carolina. In the past year, TigerSwan won two U.S. Department of State contracts worth over $7 million to operate in Afghanistan, according to USAS pending.gov. 
TigerSwan, however, claims on its website that the contract is worth $25 million, and said in a press release that the State Department contract called for the company to 'monitor, assess, and advise current and future nation building and stability initiatives in Afghanistan.' Since 2008, TigerSwan has won about $57.7 million worth of U.S. government contracts and subcontracts for security services. 
Company founder and CEO James Reese , a veteran of the elite Army Delta Force , served as the 'lead advisor for Special Operations to the Director of the CIA for planning, operations and integration for the invasion of Afghanistan and Operation Enduring Freedom' in Iraq, according to his company biography. Army Delta partakes in mostly covert and high-stakes missions and is part of the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command ( JSOC ) , the latter well known for killing Osama Bin Laden. 
One of TigerSwan's advisory board members, Charles Pittman, has direct ties to the oil and gas industry. Pittman 'served as President of Amoco Egypt Oil Company, Amoco Eurasia Petroleum Company, and Regional President BP Amoco plc. (covering the Middle East, the Caspian Sea region, Egypt, and India),' according to his company biography . 
'Sad, But Not Surprising' 
Investigative journalist Jeremy Scahill told Democracy Now! in a 2009 interview that TigerSwan did some covert operations work with Blackwater USA , dubbed the ' world's most powerful mercenary army ' in his book by the same name. Blackwater has also guarded oil pipelines in central Asia, according to Scahill's book . 
Reese advised Blackwater and took a leave of absence from TigerSwan in 2008 in the aftermath of the Nisour Square Massacre , a shooting in Iraq conducted by Blackwater officers which saw 17 Iraqi civilians killed. TigerSwan has a business relationship with Babylon Eagles Security Company , a private security firm headquartered in Iraq which also has had business ties with Blackwater . 
'It is sad, but not surprising, that this firm has ties to the US interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq,' Medea Benjamin, co-founder of the women-led peace group CODEPINK and the co-founder of the human rights group Global Exchange, told DeSmog. 'It is another terrifying example of how our violent interventions abroad come home to haunt us in the form of repression and violation of our civil rights.' 
The North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Private Investigation and Security Board are also conducting parallel investigations to the one recently completed by Morton County. TigerSwan did not comment on questions posed about their contract.

This has been a debate garnering some attention in the UK for several years, mainly under the auspices of a contrast between 'Red Tory' and 'Blue Labour'. 
This debate, which has about the need for a mutualism countering the bureaucratic state and providing collective resources for private individuals abandoned to laissez faire, has not however been significant in the US. 
In the US, the function of the state is very much to aid and abet the oligarchy by blurring the line between the government and the private sector to the advantage of the latter, as opposed to being a check on it. US governments have therefore all but abandoned their role as the indispensable and major provider of essential welfare services. 
Even 'Tricky Dicky' Nixon, knave that he was, went along with such relatively ample provision by the state. 
Today, however, American politicians, unless they are super-rich, can't campaign effectively without monetary heft from a plutocratic private sector, to which they are then utterly beholden. Hillary Clinton anyone? 
American politicians who mount the slightest challenge to this rapaciously dysfunctional political system'îGeorge McGovern in days of yore, Denis Kucinich a few years ago, and now Sanders'ì are sent packing by its upholders. 
In the UK the Tories and New Labour have advanced on a similar neoliberal path since Thatcher, but encountered more resistance from voters, largely because its Celtic fringe adheres resolutely to the welfare state, and because there is still in the UK a solid bloc of voters to the left of the main parliamentary parties on several major issues (war, environmental protection, ringfencing the NHS, a commitment to public education, and the need for a fairer electoral system, being the most prominent). 
The postwar settlements after 1945 in the countries of the west depended on a broadly Keynesian concordat, mediated by the state, between labour and capital. 
In the 1970s this concordat fell into a crisis, and was dissolved by the governments of Reagan and Thatcher, whose names are often given to the succeeding neoliberal politico-economic paradigm. 
However, neoliberalism, with its emphasis on supposed market forces, has failed to deliver a general prosperity while exacerbating economic inequality, as well as promoting unstable bubble economies as the sole alternative to a widespread stagnation. 
In response to these failures of the social-welfare state (on the one hand) and a no-holds-barred neoliberal economic individualism (on the other), there has been a growth of interest in the UK in 'mutualist' paradigms emphasizing cooperation, in self-governing and voluntary associations, on a scale smaller than the state but larger and more collective than that acceptable to a market-bedazzled or market-entrapped homo oeconomicus. 
These voluntary and self-governing associations will be non-profit making and funded out of the public purse. 
In the UK, the Blue Labour 'tendency' (for it is no more than that in effective political terms) ratifies a form of mutualism, and in the US Bernie Sanders expressed interest in participatory political forms stressing mutualism, at least when he was still contending with Hillary Clinton for their party's nomination to be a candidate for the 2016 presidential election. 
However, a state-driven social democracy of the kind prevailing until the 1970s will be difficult to revive because the state favoured by neoliberalism is a Market-State in root and branch, with market-imperatives'ì or rather those of quasi-markets, because neoliberal markets are rigged and rent-seeking (as Michael Hudson , Guy Standing , and others have pointed out) 'î dominating the State's core. 
This neoliberal Market-State is more about entrenching the parasitic rentier-based oligarchy than promoting the fabled competitive markets extolled by classical liberalism. 
So, the key question for us is whether new forms of cooperation and mutualism, socialist in nature, can emerge in an innovative kind of post-neoliberal state, forms which can then exist in concert with crucially-important local and regional formations. 
Blue Labour's proponents have identified a panoply of measures and steps as the way to inaugurate a full-blown associationism: co-operative ventures of all kinds, community banks and credit unions, community-sponsored daycare and eldercare, youth clubs, greatly augmented municipal government, proper apprenticeship schemes (as opposed to largely inconsequential 'work your way in the hope you get a job' workfare arrangements), and so on. 
However, if neoliberalism remains, there will be no real move to a sufficient mutualism. So, decisive steps must be taken to push neoliberalism to the side. Blue Labour purports to be an alternative to neoliberalism, but does not endorse (at least not explicitly) the revolutionary means needed to supplant the neoliberal order. 
A mutualism which does not tackle the overridingly important issue of the ownership of assets, and fails to advance their common ownership, is going to be a paper tiger (to resort to the nomenclature of the Great Helmsman). 
Other interim measures will include an overturning of regnant macroeconomic policy, to encompass the greater taxation of wealth; the abolition of opportunities to extract rentier-based incomes (neoliberalism's modus operandi); the repatriation of capital that has migrated to Wall Street and the City of London; the introduction of capital controls; the reduction of military spending; greater provision of resources on infrastructure, health, and education; converting banks into public utilities whose sole role is the intermediation between buyers and sellers (as opposed to the emphasis on gratuitously unproductive forms of speculation and arbitrage so prevalent today); supporting trade unions; placing important services conducing to our overall good in the public domain, which need not necessarily be statist, since the public domain will perforce now include a variety of formations that are associationist. 
Another significant step would be the disruption of the monetary symbiosis now existing between the corporate and political √©lites. 
Also important will be the reduction, and ultimately the elimination, of the for-profit sector when this does not operate for the public good. 
An example of how a project undertaken by a private company can easily be placed in the hands of a publicly-owned organization is the upcoming construction of London's 'super sewer' system. Balfour Beatty, the controversial giant construction company , has been awarded a ¬£416m contract to build a section of this 'super sewer' (and we can count on the almost inevitable cost overruns doubling and even tripling the sum stipulated in the original deal). 
BB is a private company with shareholders and private investors. A project on this scale could easily have been undertaken by a publicly-owned and controlled body, which would return earnings to the public purse, as opposed to feathering the nests of a small group of private citizens. 
Today colossally lucrative enterprises, making their originators some of the wealthiest people on earth, exist in a realm that can best be described as virtual. 
Uber owns no taxis, Airbnb owns no rental properties, EBay/Alibaba possess no inventory, Facebook generates no content of its own, TaskRabbit and Amazon's Mechanical Turk (the latter's motto being 'giving you access to a scalable workforce') create no sustainable jobs but use the internet to 'match' individuals with substantial incomes needing someone to undertake menial tasks or run small errands, with a hapless 'gig' clientele more or less willing to do this for chickenfeed. 
In addition, high-speed stock traders sit at desks transmuting algorithms into computer pixels to generate obscene rental returns ('profit' generally being used in classical economics only to characterize gains accruing from actual productive investment) in a few clicks of the keyboard. 
Dispensing with the stock-market racket will only require political will, admittedly not an easy undertaking since the political √©lites have also been allowed to feed at its trough. 
At the same time, the other virtual enterprises can be put to social uses: Uber can become a communal car-sharing service, Airbnb can serve the homeless, and TaskRabbit and Mechanical Turk can service the needs of a market providing substantial employment beyond the level of 'gig' jobs. 
All citizens should have access to common basic entitlements, and associations will be publicly funded only if they are open to all and willing to provide services on the basis of public entitlements. 
The removal of neoliberalism, and ultimately capitalism itself, is going to be the surest way to bring about an extended and long-lasting mutualism and associationism. 
If neoliberalism and capitalism continue exist, we will be mired in an ethos based on the absurd proposition that we must first 'create wealth', then somehow find ways to prise the loot generated by this process out of the fingers of a fortunate few to 'improve the quality of life' for the rest of us. 
Is there any greater idiocy, apart from the possible notion that the interests of the generality of the US and the world will be adequately served by a Trump or Clinton presidency?

Hafnarfjor√∞ur, Iceland. 
The votes are in. In a greater-than-expected 79% turnout, election results show that Iceland's Pirate Party has not come out in first place as earlier polls indicated might be the case. They have, however, increased their size in the Parliament 3-fold (from 3 seats to 10) but this will not be enough to steer Iceland in their direction. 
Now it¬¥s all about coalition building. 
Had they maintained those poll numbers from earlier this summer (at a one-time high of 35%), that would have given them the probable first choice to form a coalition government with either the Left-Greens, the Social-Democrats, or the center-leftish Bright Future. As it stands now, they will need to band together, something they all they agreed to consider during a pre-election press conference. 
The largest single party remains the corporate-right Independence Party with 29% or 21 seats and which is now part of the governing coalition along with the center-right Progressive Party (who suffered a humiliating loss of 11 seats, now down to 8). This coalition is the same center-right configuration which led Iceland to financial disaster, the flight of skilled doctors and other professionals, and whose members were implicated in off-shore money scams which led to the resignation earlier this year of their last PM from the Progressive Party, causing these early elections, and now to the formal resignation of their present PM just a few hours ago. Technically these two parties could form a 3-party coalition along with the new Regeneration Party. However, Regeneration leader Benedikt J√≥hanesson has said he wouldn¬¥t consider a coalition with the governing parties. Thus that particular scenario is doubted. 
After years of political stagnation following the collapse of the economy, and controversy over the Panama Papers leaking of wealthy Icelanders¬¥ involvement in Tortola, this new development reflects a growing, widespread disgust at the traditional two party coalition rulers who have alternately or in pairs run the country for most of its years following Iceland's independence. 
The ship is floundering and the present course is unsustainable. 
The other numbers however, are pointing to a change of course: The Pirates won 14.5% giving them 10 seats in the 63 seat Parliament, the Althing. The Left-Greens received 15.9% (for 10 Seats); the Social Democrats 5.7% (3 seats) and Bright Future 7.2% (winning 4 seats).Together they represent almost 30% of the electorate. These are the groups which began talking about joining forces this past week, just before the election. 
If a four party coalition is solidified, then Iceland becomes the second nation to have a viable Pirate Party within its government (Germany is the first) and the first to have it this close to the helm in the country¬¥s governance. 
The kingmakers could very well be Regeneration, a new, center-right grouping who won 10.5% of the votes getting them 7 seats. They characterize themselves as 'liberal', though the head was a long-time supporter of the Independence Party before leaving this past year. On the 18th of October he said he wouldn't consider joining a coalition with the two-headed ruling hydra of the Independence and Progressive parties. Were he instead to agree to an alliance with the four roughly left, center-left groups of which the Pirates are a part (something he declared he was open to the morning after the election), then that would net a total of 34 seats (27 + their 7) and a solid majority. A five party coalition. 
What does this all mean? It means several things: in the short run, the helm of the Icelandic political ship will remain loosely dominated by the Independence Party as the largest single grouping in the Althingi (Parliament). But aside from that approximately 30% of the electorate who aren¬¥t swayed by anything but their loyalty to the ruling class, the rest of the country is moving on. They are actively exploring hitherto unheard of politics (with the Pirates) and considering broad coalition politics (5 groups trying to control the direction of the country). This may be the wave of the future. Or it may simply be a transitional era where loyalties are split and serious discussions about radical ideas like ownership of public resources (and actually and clearly defining such) occur openly as the public coalesces around a new, dominant ideology. In the long run, things are changing. And then there is this issue of a new Constitution which was voted on and accepted by the public but which the ruling coalition simply ignored and shelved. If that was now formally accepted, then some serious changes may be in store for the Owners of the country. But today is only the day after, and nothing has been decided yet. 
So what¬¥s next? Well, the new President's job just got more complicated as he is the one who traditionally asks the leading party to form the new government and, if they fail in securing a stable majority, the next leading party would get a shot. This was easier when the totals were generally in favor of one or the other of the two ruling groups. Now, however, a new multi-party dynamic is at play. Who knows how the discussions are heading right now, and which horses are being traded? 
Iceland has always been the most USAmerican of the Nordic countries but with tugs in both directions. Much like the island itself, rent down the middle by volcanic cracks dividing the European and American tectonic plates, these tugs are causing great tension as to which political direction the country should follow. With history having taken them this far and a growing unease about the dominant parties¬¥ corruption and rehashed free market rhetoric, it appears Iceland is not quite ready to jump ship and hand the wheel over to the Pirates. But they and their kind are looking better and better as each year passes and Iceland drifts without a clear direction to prosperity and fairness. In the long run, that tectonic split in politics is getting wider and wider, just like its geographical counterpart. 
But it is the Pirates who at least have captured the imagination of the people (and, in particular the young). If they can convince the rest of the public that they are more seriously interested in governing than in luring Edward Snowden here (a publicity stunt at best) and have more relevant meat and potato concerns beyond internet privacy, then they may very well be the ultimate winners a few years down the road.

The boat, along with other means of travel, are often undertaken as matters of freedom. Movement keeps one alive in times of peace, and in conflict. The Australian government, and those backing its practices, have wished over the years to limit, if not halt such movement altogether. 
Since the last decade, extreme measures have been implemented that effectively qualify Australian sovereignty while singling out a particular breed of asylum seeker. The former aspect of that policy was specifically undertaken to excise the entire mainland from being qualified as territorially valid to arrive in. 
The entire policy effectively assumed a military character, most conspicuously under the Abbott government's embrace of a creepily crypto-fascist border protection force, equipped with uniforms and patriotic purpose. Operation Sovereign Borders effectively meant that the refugee and asylum seeker were fair game 'ì not to be processed and settled equitably with a minimum of fuss, but to be repelled, their boats towed back to Indonesia, and people smugglers bribed. 
An entire intelligence-security complex has also been created, fed by private contractors and held in place by the promise of a two-year prison sentence for entrusted officials in possession of 'protected' information. 
Such statements as those made today by Prime Minister Turnbull, announced with note of grave urgency at a press conference, tend to resemble a typical pattern in Australian politics since the Howard years. 
The borders, even if supposedly secure, are deemed to be in a permanent state of siege, forever battered by potential invaders keen to swindle Parliament and the Australian people. Yes, boasted the Abbott, and now Turnbull government, the boats laden with desperate human cargo have stopped coming. Yes, all is well on the sea lanes in terms of repelling such unwanted arrivals. But for all of this, the island continent is being assaulted by characters of will, those keen to avail themselves of desperate people and their desire for a secure, safe haven. 
The policy has also received international attention from such establishment institutions as The New York Times. 'While that arrangement,' went an editorial this month, 'largely stopped the flow of boats packed with people that set off from Indonesia weekly, it has landed these refugees 'ì many from Iran, Myanmar, Iraq and Afghanistan 'ì in what amounts to cruel and indefinite detention.' 
As the editorial continued to observe, 'This policy costs Australian taxpayers a staggering $US419,000 per detainee a year and has made a nation that has historically welcomed immigrants a violator of international law.' 
While this obscenity has been powdered and perfumed as humanitarian, designed to halt the spate of drowning cases at sea, the latest announcements have abandoned the stance. 'They must know,' claimed Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, 'that the door to Australia is closed to those who seek to come here by boat with a people smuggler.' 
Finally, an honest statement twinning two perceived demons in Australian refugee policy: the people smuggler and the asylum seeker, both equivalently horrible to Australian authorities. To that end, not a single asylum seeker arriving by boat will be permitted to settle in Australia. This policy will also affect arrivals from July 2013. 
Such a stance of finality seems little different to pervious ones made by Abbott's predecessor, Kevin Rudd. What is troubling about it is the element of monomania: never will any asylum seeker, who had arrived after a certain date, will be permitted to settle in Australia. 
The intention there is to make sure that those designated refugees on Manus Island and Nauru, facilitated by Australia's draconian offshore regime, will have the doors shut, effectively ensuring a more prolonged, torturous confinement. Absurdly, they will then be permitted to slum away indefinitely in such indigent places as Nauru, with a population hostile to those from the Middle East and Africa. 
Turnbull's stance may also suggest a degree of desperation. Not all has gone swimmingly with the offshore detention complex. The PNG Supreme Court rendered an aspect of the Australian refugee policy redundant in finding that detaining individuals indefinitely on Manus Island breached constitutional rights. 
Peter Dutton, the hapless Minister for Immigration, has struggled in managing what can only be described by the border security obsessives as an administrative disaster. Rather than admitting to the realities that searching for refuge over dangerous routes will always find a market, the Australian government persists in a cruel delusion that continues to deny international refugee law while punishing the victims.

Media coverage has recently been saturated with distressing scenes showing the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, where aerial bombardment has led to a heavy loss of civilian life. The severity of the crisis instinctively makes us want to help 'ì scores of protesters gathered outside the seat of the British prime minister on Saturday holding signs calling on the government to 'Save Aleppo' and impose a 'No-Bomb Zone Now'. While the anger is understandable, the way it is being channeled reflects a circumscribed policy debate 'ì there are other options than a No-Fly Zone, which should be avoided as it would harm rather than help efforts to alleviate the suffering of Syrian civilians. 
In any area of policy, the mainstream debate revolves around policy alternatives that reflect establishment divisions. For example, in economics, 'there is no alternative' to neoliberalism, at least there wasn't until Keynesianism was rediscovered by some elites after the 2008 crisis. The debate over what is to be done over Syria revolves around two policy alternatives: the hawks, including likely next U.S. president, Hillary Clinton, advocate a NFZ and the doves, including the current U.S. administration, maintain that the sanctions regime should be increased. This effectively reflects a division within the establishment on how to proceed. Serious policy alternatives are not discussed. In particular, discussion of increasing aid and support to refugees, surely the most obvious way of directly helping civilians in Syria, and what the UN has called on industrialized countries to do , is curious by its absence. 
This circumscribed debate does not logically follow from its supposed pretext 'ì stopping civilian loss of life. In fact, a NFZ is a policy that would unavoidably lead to civilians dying. Enforcing a NFZ means destroying air defenses, which are located to defend cities 'ì i.e. they are located in areas where there are many civilians. Even the flagbearer for the hawks, Hillary Clinton, has admitted privately that with a No-Fly Zone 'you're going to kill a lot of Syrians'; such intervention will 'take a lot of civilians'. This realization would seem inconsistent with the often-used humanitarian pretext, but it makes sense given Hillary Clinton's recent admission that her top priority in Syria is removing Syrian President Assad. 
There is a clear parallel with the imposition of a NFZ in Libya, which prolonged the conflict and worsened the situation for civilians. NATO bombing directly led to scores of civilian deaths and facilitated the overthrow of the regime by rebel militias that have killed, and are continuing to kill , thousands. Particularly repugnant was the ethnic cleansing of black people , including through public lynching . In a 2013 paper , Alan Kuperman, a Harvard academic, argued that NATO intervention extended the war by a factor of 6 and increased the death toll 7 to 10 times; given that Libya is now a failed state, torn apart by warlords, we can safely say that these estimates were too conservative. President Obama privately calls the situation in Libya a ' shit show '. Only last month a report from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British Parliament found that the humanitarian justification was an insufficient pretext and based on falsehoods, the supposedly limited intervention led 'ineluctably' to regime change, and that the (British) government, and by implication other participating Western powers, did not seriously consider diplomatic alternatives to military action. 
Regardless, the mantra of Western foreign policy is 'it will be different this time' 'ì unlike all recent Western military interventions this one will be limited, successful and won't leave a worse humanitarian situation in its wake. Although, if the dire humanitarian situation in Aleppo necessitates immediate action, then why are there not equally loud calls for action for civilians facing similar situations? U.S. bombing in Manbij and Kobane in Syria and Ramadi and Fallujah in Iraq has resulted in thousands of civilian deaths and flattened entire neighbourhoods ; more than a third of US and UK backed Saudi airstrikes in Yemen have hit civilian sites, including schools , hospitals , weddings and funerals . 
Talking about this is not meant as a distraction or relativization; the fact that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are engaged in similar activities does not make the bombing of Aleppo less objectionable. However, it does raise questions about the motives of those pushing so hard for a no-fly zone. If western foreign policy actors, and their allies in press, were motivated by humanitarian concerns, then surely stopping these atrocities should appear on the policy agenda 'ì especially given that the action required is easier and does not risk war with Russia. 
If humanitarian considerations were really the important factors in the foreign policy debate, then there would be discussion on the legitimacy of aerial bombardment of cities and towns, given that this invariably leads to civilian deaths. International agreements have been successful in making chemical and biological weapons illegal, a prohibition which is generally followed ( though not always ). The first well-publicized use of aerial bombardment, the Nazi bombing of Guernica in 1937, caused righteous, popular outrage. Tragically, however, its use became normalized during the Second World War and a ban on aerial bombing of cities was not included in the post-war international settlement. The fact that this seems so hopelessly idealistic reflects the fact that it is geopolitics, not humanitarian considerations, that govern international relations and foreign policy discussion; human suffering is nothing more than a useful pretext for whatever actions you want to take in order to secure geopolitical advantage. The U.S. and its allies want to remove Syria from Russia's orbit, so therefore the dictator there must go, but airstrikes to support the dictator in Yemen are fine, because the dictator there is a friend of close U.S. ally Saudi Arabia. 
There is an added complication with the NFZ in Syria in that it marks a return to Cold-War era brinkmanship and possible armed confrontation with Russia. The logic of brinkmanship runs that to make geopolitical gains, one must escalate to a level that will make the other side back down, partly by convincing your enemy you are ready to commit irrational acts. There is an inherent danger in this game: both states are nuclear armed and the consequences of a spiral of escalation could be devastating . 
Syria hawks, or what close Obama aide Ben Rhodes called the ' pro-stupid shit ' caucus, argue that a NFZ will lead Russia to effectively back down: for example, Clinton argued that it will 'give us leverage in our conversations with Russia'. (Interestingly, in the exchange this quote from Clinton indicated the war goal: a NFZ will make Russia 'put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track' 'ì i.e. Russia will be forced to accept regime change.) After all, despite the panic in the press, Russia is actually a feeble successor state to a superpower, and would come off worse in a direct conflict with the preeminent might of North America, or so the logic runs. 
However, 'dovish' Western foreign policy actors point to the danger that advanced Russian materiel support to Syria poses to the enforcement of a NFZ. Unlike other recent U.S. military adventures, enforcing a NFZ in Syria could lead to significant, and politically unpalatable, American casualties 'ì pilots will be shot down. This realization means that saner establishment figures are opposed to a NFZ. For example, U.S. Army General Carter Ham, who oversaw the NFZ in Libya, said a NFZ is a 'violent combat action that results in lots of casualties and increased risk to our own personnel'. 
Instead, relative doves like current Secretary of State John Kerry advocate intensifying the sanctions regime against Syria and Russia. Again, this does not seem to be seriously about helping civilians. A leaked UN report has revealed that the existing Western sanctions regime is preventing humanitarian aid and creating a humanitarian disaster that threatens to rival that caused by the Oil-for-Food program in Iraq during the 1990s. The history of sanctions tends to show that the costs are borne by civilians, and a Petersen Institute study of all sanctions incidents since WWII shows that sanctions failed to achieve their goals in about ‚Öî of cases, and are even less successful when applied against enemies and autocrats. 
So, what is to be done? What should people in the West and globally push for to help the people of Syria? Unfortunately, there do not seem to be any quick fixes 'ì the situation in Syria is complex and involves diverse actors, with competing interests. Immediate relief to the refugees fleeing the conflict should be a priority. In terms of foreign policy, campaigning for de-escalation and diplomacy against constant militarism remain the best solutions for the Syrian people, and humanity generally.

Those of us who study how to end wars rather than find new ways to prosecute them must be stunned, like many Colombians, by a popular vote there on October 2 that rejected the peace agreement between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). No one predicted that after over five decades of fighting and more than 200,000 deaths, a peace agreement that took six years to conclude would be rejected. It's a lesson in how the power of emotion'îvengefulness, specifically'îand narrow self-interest can overcome good sense. The general perception of observers is that voters who suffered from the civil war wanted to see the FARC rebels punished rather than 'rewarded' with the opportunity to reenter civil society and even hold a guaranteed number of seats in the national congress. 
Most civil wars end in much the same way as Colombia's'îwith one side badly hurting and willing to disarm under a cease-fire, provided the government promises assistance so that the rebellious soldiers can reintegrate in civil society. Negotiations to reach such an agreement typically are arduous and often seem to be on the brink of failure. Long-held grievances come to life again and again, and it is a tribute to negotiators that they were able to come to any substantive agreement at all. So it was with high expectations that an agreement was reached, and the decision of Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos, to put it to a popular vote showed his confidence that citizens weary of war would accept it. Five days after the vote, he was rewarded for his efforts with the Nobel Peace Prize. 
That Colombians did not endorse the agreement evidently owes much to the politicians who campaigned for a 'no' vote, including former president √Älvaro Uribe, whose father was killed by the FARC. He argues that the peace agreement is too soft on FARC leaders, allowing them to avoid prison merely by confessing their crimes and promising to make restitution to victims. According to one observer who opposes the peace accord, 'Essentially, FARC members would have received the same legal power to prosecute Colombian government officials and vice versa. The rejected deal would also have shielded an unknown number of FARC guerillas from jail for drug trafficking, recruitment of child soldiers, and other crimes.' The many thousands of people whose families were directly impacted by FARC killings and kidnappings obviously agreed. 
The razor-thin 'no' vote (50.2 percent to 49.7 percent) also may be attributed to the bizarre fact that only 38 percent of eligible voters voted . Perhaps this was a Brexit-like situation in which many people stayed away from the polls on the assumption a 'yes' vote was fairly certain. But the 'no' voters were well entrenched, including not only Uribe's party but also 'the majority of the churches, the ELN [the National Liberation Army, the second-largest guerrilla force], business sectors . . ., and the majority of landowners, who were all against the proposed changes.' The right-wing groups not only considered President Santos' peace plan soft on FARC; they also objected to his support of gay rights, reforms of land policy, and investment in rural development. 
It was under Uribe, not coincidentally, that the US became a major participant in Colombia's civil war. Under 'Plan Colombia' the US provided the Colombian military with advanced weapons (such as Blackhawk helicopters) and intelligence (under a top-secret multi-billion dollar CIA program) that escalated the violence and decimated the FARC's ranks. A FARC leader is quoted as saying that it faced 'an international intervention, and it took a toll.' Civilian deaths and the displacement of about seven million people followed, caused in no small part by officially sanctioned right-wing death squads. 
Some US officials believe that intervention 'saved' Colombia from endless civil war by forcing FARC to the bargaining table. That is hardly an argument for peacemaking; the 'no' vote was actually a defeat for the US policy of peace through war. Plan Colombia was to a great extent responsible for destroying, either through deaths or displacements, the lives of roughly 15 percent of the total population. Now the US supports a negotiated settlement, but still keeps FARC on the State Department's Foreign Terrorist Organizations List. The Santos government and FARC have agreed to continue a cease-fire until December 31 . 
We may hope the parties will be guided by the need for rehabilitation and reconstruction rather than vengeance'îfor peace rather than retributive justice. 
As President Santos said , 'Making peace is much more difficult than making war because you need to change sentiments of people, people who have suffered, to try to persuade them to forgive.'

Michael Moore has made some terrific movies in the past, and Where to Invade Next may be the best of them, but I expected Trumpland to be (1) about Trump, (2) funny, (3) honest, (4) at least relatively free of jokes glorifying mass murder. I was wrong on all counts and would like my $4.99 back, Michael. 
Moore's new movie is a film of him doing a stand-up comedy show about how wonderfully awesome Hillary Clinton is 'î except that he mentions Trump a bit at the beginning and he's dead serious about Clinton being wonderfully awesome. 
This film is a text book illustration of why rational arguments for lesser evilist voting do not work. Lesser evilists become self-delusionists. They identify with their lesser evil candidate and delude themselves into adoring the person. Moore is not pushing the 'Elect her and then hold her accountable' stuff. He says we have a responsibility to 'support her' and 'get behind her,' and that if after two years 'î yes, TWO YEARS 'î she hasn't lived up to a platform he's fantasized for her, well then, never fear, because he, Michael Moore, will run a joke presidential campaign against her for the next two years (this from a guy who backed restricting the length of election campaigns in one of his better works). 
Moore maintains that virtually all criticism of Hillary Clinton is nonsense. What do we think, he asks, that she asks how many millions of dollars you've put into the Clinton Foundation and then she agrees to bomb Yemen for you? Bwahahaha! Pretty funny. Except that Saudi Arabia put over $10 million into the Clinton Foundation, and while she was Secretary of State Boeing put in another $900,000, upon which Hillary Clinton reportedly made it her mission to get the planes sold to Saudi Arabia, despite legal restrictions 'î the planes now dropping U.S.-made bombs on Yemen with U.S. guidance, U.S. refueling mid-air, U.S. protection at the United Nations, and U.S. cover in the form of pop-culture distraction and deception from entertainers like Michael Moore. 
Standing before a giant Air Force missile and enormous photos of Hillary Clinton, Michael Moore claims that substantive criticism of Clinton can consist of only two things, which he dismisses in a flash: her vote for a war on Iraq and her coziness with Wall Street. He says nothing more about what that 'coziness' consists of, and he claims that she's more or less apologized and learned her lesson on Iraq. 
What? It wasn't one vote. It was numerous votes to start the war, fund it, and escalate it. It was the lies to get it going and keep it going. It's all the other wars before and since. 
*She says President Obama was wrong not to launch missile strikes on Syria in 2013. *She pushed hard for the overthrow of Qadaffi in 2011. *She supported the coup government in Honduras in 2009. *She has backed escalation and prolongation of war in Afghanistan. *She skillfully promoted the White House justification for the war on Iraq. *She does not hesitate to back the use of drones for targeted killing. *She has consistently backed the military initiatives of Israel. *She was not ashamed to laugh at the killing of Qadaffi. *She has not hesitated to warn that she could obliterate Iran. *She is eager to antagonize Russia. *She helped facilitate a military coup in Ukraine. *She has the financial support of the arms makers and many of their foreign customers. *She waived restrictions at the State Department on selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Qatar, all states wise enough to donate to the Clinton Foundation. *She supported President Bill Clinton's wars and the power of the president to make war without Congress. *She has advocated for arming fighters in Syria and for a 'No Fly' zone. *She supported a surge in Iraq even before President Bush did. 
That's just her war problem. What about her banking problem, prison problem, fracking problem, corporate trade problem, corporate healthcare problem, climate change problem, labor problem, Social Security problem, etc.? 
Moore parts company from substantive critique in order to lament unproven rightwing claims that Hillary Clinton has murdered various people. 'I hope she did,' screams Moore. 'That's who I want as Commander in Chief!' Hee hee hee. 
Then Moore shamelessly pushes the myth that Hillary tried to create single-payer, or at least 'universal' healthcare (whatever that is) in the 1990s. In fact, as I heard Paul Wellstone tell it, single-payer easily won the support of Clinton's focus group, but she buried it for her corporate pals and produced the phonebook-size monstrosity that was dead on arrival but reborn in another form years later as Obamacare. She killed single-payer then, has not supported it since, and does not propose it now. (Well, she does admit in private that it's the only thing that works, as her husband essentially blurts out in public.) But Moore claims that because we didn't create 'universal' healthcare in the 1990s we all have the blood of millions on our hands, millions whom Hillary would have saved had we let her. 
Moore openly fantasizes: what would it be like if Hillary Clinton is secretly progressive? Remember that Moore and many others did the exact same thing with Obama eight years ago. To prove Clinton's progressiveness Moore plays an audio clip of her giving a speech at age 22 in which she does not hint at any position on any issue whatsoever. 
Mostly, however, Moore informs us that Hillary Clinton is female. He anticipates 'that glorious moment when the other gender has a chance to run this world and kick some righteous ass.' Now tell me please, dear world, if your ass is kicked by killers working for a female president will you feel better about it? How do you like Moore's inclusive comments throughout his performance: 'We're all Americans, right?' 
Moore's fantasy is that Clinton will dash off a giant pile of executive orders, just writing Congress out of the government 'î executive orders doing things like releasing all nonviolent drug offenders from prison immediately (something the real Hillary Clinton would oppose in every way she could). 
But when he runs for president, Moore says, he'll give everybody free drugs. 
I'll tell you the Clinton ad I'd like to see. She's standing over a stove holding an egg. 'This is your brain,' she says solemnly, cracking it into the pan with a sizzle. 'This is your brain on partisanship.'

As a leftist and as a woman, I have always been aware how important language is to our social, political and interpersonal functioning. Moreover, as a female from any culture in the world, you learn from birth that not only does your body define who you are to others , the language through which you are defined and described does as well. Women especially understand the the nuances of language that underpin our experiences such that we are the object of 'lady jokes' about female presidents and 'that time of the month' (what if she starts a nuclear war?) and about those sexually uptight feminists who just need a good fuck to get over their 'prudishness' about being cat-called. What language ends up evoking, however, is inevitably caught in a double bind as women are forever cast within the conterminous liberatory and carceral limits of meaning. The language used to describe females is inevitably a reflection of the social and political bigotry whereby language is never really precise and as employed is always too much or too little. 
Fredric Jameson's The Prison-House of Language provides a critical account of the structuralist movement in the social sciences focussing on the likes of Ferdinand de Saussure whose work Jameson regards as far too removed from historical and material reality. Warning the reader against the trap of 'ideological closure' within language, Jameson seeks to avoid the confinement that language imposes through what he deems as the 'prison-house of language.' 
In a bizarre reversal of Jameson's critique, we are in the throes of new culture wars that are far removed from Robert Mapplethorpe's photography of black male bodies invigilated by conservative, Christian adherent, Jesse Helms. Instead, we are living through a moment when the liberal sector of society is, instead of image constabulary, undertaking some rather Draconian forms of language policing. Composed of a university student and twenty-something population, this movement harbours a profoundly conserve narrative, albeit couched as 'progressive,' whereby the names we call ourselves are imposed upon others. 
The major battleground for this debate is at the University of Toronto where psychology professor, Jordan Peterson, has come under fire for critiquing Federal Bill C-16 . Under this bill is the proposal to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code whereby added to the list of prosecutable offences could include the 'misuse' of pronouns. On 27 September, Peterson made the first of a series of videos which takes aim at 'political correctness' at the legislative level and to a lesser degree, within his university. The current scandal is focussed on Peterson's videos and his refusal to use 'preferred pronouns,' arguing that Bill C-16 
While Peterson is certainly not a leftist and could be more accurately described as a Libertarian, his critique of the surveillance and control of language is one which resonates across the aisle because it arbitrates the current attacks on free speech by social justice warriors of the ostensible left. I include this word 'ostensible' since many of these attacks over language and pronouns revolve around identity politics which the left is almost unilaterally solidly opposed to except when the identity is couched through emotions. Couching his argument purely in terms of the freedom of speech, Peterson points out the serious dangers inherent within this proposed legislation: 
It is one thing to tell people what they can't say, but it is a completely different thing'îan absolutely differently thing'îto legislate what they have to say. And that's a line that I don't think we should cross'¶There is the inference,'¶the stated demand, that if someone wants to be addressed a certain way because they have certain emotional requirements, I am now legally compelled to comply with that. And that's what I won't do'¶ Except that there is reasonable debate to be had about biology, sexuality, and culture and the attempt to ram through a particular conception of that into legislation and policy far too rapidly and in a staggeringly ill-advised manner. 
As he has been evolving his thoughts on this subject open acknowledging that he is still coming to terms with the repercussions by this bill, in another interview with the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation), Peterson expounds upon why he doesn't recognize another person's right to determine what pronouns he uses to address people: 
That's right. I don't recognize that. I don't recognize another person's right to decide what words I'm going to use, especially when the words they want me to use, first of all, are non-standard elements of the English language and they are constructs of a small coterie of ideologically motivated people. They might have a point but I'm not going to say their words for them'¶I'm not claiming that a person is free to use any words, in any context. But what I'm saying is that I'm not willing to mouth words that I think have been created for ideological purposes. 
Peterson's words have resonated throughout the University of Toronto community'îfaculty and students alike'î and beyond. His videos and interviews have raised important questions for those of us on the left to address. Ultimately, Peterson asks if the ideas we hold so dear on the left (or the right) should be protected to such a degree that laws need be passed to proscribe how we grammatically refer to the intrinsic identity of the other forcing the subject to feed into what Peterson calls the 'ideological game' of the other. If so, who decides which side of this debate becomes legally protected? And how does putting legal protections on ideology create a political environment of totalitarianism where only certain narratives are deemed relevant, others not at all? 
The mere fact that you don't cause conflict in the present, or don't hurt someone's feelings in the present is no indication that you are acting in their best interests in the medium to long run. It would be a lovely world if the way we could set things right would be to make sure that no one's feathers ever get ruffled in the present. And that is absolutely absurd. And the idea that the fundamental doctrine governing discourse should be 'Don't hurt someone's feelings,' that is completely absurd. The fundamental doctrine governing communication should be stringent attempts to speak the truth and to listen. So you speak the truth'ìwhat you think to be the truth'ìso you can help clarify the nature of the world and then you engage in dialogue with other people and you listen on the off-chance that you have made a mistake and that the tool kit that you are using to work in the world could be improved. 
Taking the view that we need to have rational arguments about pronouns, Peterson confirms that he refuses to be the 'mouthpiece' of any ideology: 'The fastest way to make yourself sick is to not choose your words carefully. And that is the fastest to make your 'sickness' make society 'sick' too. And I think that is one of the great lessons of the twentieth century. It is the pathologisation of thought and speech, and then the pathologisation of action, because that is what follows the pathologisation of speech and thought. I'm not going down that road.' 
Peterson also speaks of the impracticalities of this measure, the potential illegalities now posed against the freedom of speech, and the potentiality that this law could make the use of pronouns fall under hate speech laws. With a measured, reasonable approach to public debate, Peterson's evaluation of Bill C-16 and his worry about the freedom of expression , he has been met with a fury of social justice worker's ire and insults, to include the public and media being subject to violence as documented by Laura Southern . 
Yet despite the violences he and the pro-free speech side of this debate endured, Peterson received a letter from the University of Toronto mentioning complaints from students, employees, and other individuals which call Peterson's comments 'unacceptable, emotionally disturbing and painful.' The letter also states that some members of the University of Toronto community have expressed fears for their safety in the wake of actions on campus following the release of Peterson's YouTube videos: 'We trust that these impacts on students and others were not your intention in making these remarks,' the letter states. 'However, in view of these impacts, as well as the requirements of the Ontario Human Rights Code, we urge you to stop repeating these statements.' 
For how can one person's refusal to use a specific pronoun actually result in the lack of safety or the creation of fear? I might think that I am the best singer in the world, but opening my mouth to sing even one bar from 'La Traviata' would most certainly result in anyone within earshot quickly plugging their ears with their fingers and cringing from the pain of my voice. Even though my feelings might be hurt because people do not say I am best thing since Callas, this fact alone should not dictate my power to impose upon people my identity as 'the best opera singer ever.' 
Peterson has to date received two letters of reprimand and warning, although just last week the University of Toronto has agreed to host a public debate on Bill C-16 and the freedom of speech. For Peterson this is welcome news north of the border. However in New York a similar debate has only recently begun as NYU Clinical Assistant Professor of Liberal Studies, Michael Rectenwald , has been critiquing the culture of trigger warnings, safe spaces and surveillance on universities campuses around the country. Using an undercover Twitter account Deplorable NYU Prof , Rectenwald claims to '[expose] the viral identity politics of academia and its destruction of academic integrity.' Unlike Peterson, Rectenwald does not view this situation of academic control within academia as linked to political correctness as he told the Washington Square News : 'My contention is that the trigger warning, safe spaces and bias hotline reporting is not politically correct. It is insane. This stuff is producing a culture of hypervigilance, self-surveillance and panopticism'¶This kind of left that we're talking about: the SJW'îidentity-politics left'îit's not political; it's religious.' Rectenwald was forced to go on paid leave through the end of the semester. 
It has been recently theorised that the way Internet algorithms are written, direct us toward articles, websites, and search results that reflect our own ideological mindset. This current explains why online discussions in recent years have become so silenced by agreement and worse, where humans' collective inability to tolerate dissent, difference or disagreement is alarming. Hence, most of us tend to use the Internet today to confirm that which we already know, our own private echo chamber which is further reflected by social media . Peterson's pushback against the policing of language and thought should be discussed openly and without stigma. And more importantly, we need to be reaching across to political actors with whom we might otherwise have nothing in common politically. The larger issues posed by the interception and control of free speech always turns back to the political tendency of who is controlling and who is controlled. 
Some Black Guy has put this entire debate into context by laughing at the absurdity that one person can be vilified and positioned as another's enemy simply for refusing the 'preferred pronouns.' Laughing at the notion that this refusal to engage in preferred pronouns constitutes murder, Some Black Guy observes how those labelling people who disagree 'the enemy' are demanding to be 'attended to.' And this is a thorn in any leftist support of such narratives which atomise the individual as sacred and where the collective or historical is necessarily 'anti-progressive.' These are teleological explanations of the universe which posit the need for the complete control of language within the rationale of the violent other. We have been here before and it didn't go well in any of those historical 'rinse cycles.' 
Clearly if all the identitarians have up their sleeve is to enforce a Stasi-esque catechism of pronouns or else , then this debate has already been lost. To live in a free society means that all of us risk being offended, hurt, and emotionally tainted. To posture a 21st century 'parental advisory' label to all speech means that we have not only entered into the echo chamber, but that we have firmly nailed it hermetically shut. Moreover, the pronouns we use to discuss ourselves as individuals can only occur in the first person singular, I. The minute we interact with the world, we enter into the second and third-person, the plural, as well as subject and object pronouns. I can only evoke myself through my own language'îthe language of I and me , of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and so forth. I question if we can institute √† la Academie fran√ßaise a control of language that actually responds to identity such that feelings are linguistically matched to words and not further ensnared within the lack that language presents. 
I also wonder if it is at reasonable to require people, under order of the state, to remember any one of several dozen identities with their presumably hyper-individualised pronouns. From a practical perspective this would be a nightmare as the number of identitarian words and pronouns are increasing rapidly. And from a legal direction, it would create the opposite effect: most people would avoid those who are deemed as 'difficult' and this sort of mandated speech would set off a domino effect of other vocabulary which we might be, in the not-so-distant future, required to utter. We also need to consider if identity politics is part of a larger cultural pathology of hyper-individualised people who are acting out and who, well, may simply be difficult if not entirely controlling. At heart, requiring that one be spoken of with a specific pronoun is a clear form of control. We need to discuss as a society if we should be legally mandating language in order to accommodate people's feelings and quasi-religious beliefs. 
When asked about his motives and the potential trouble he could get into for speaking out, Peterson replies: 
Well, the biggest reason is because not doing so will get you into far bigger trouble. This is another example of the conflict between emotional regulation in the present versus emotional regulation in the future'¶.If free speech is under assault'¶then the amount of trouble you're going to get into for standing up right now for your right to think what you need to, and say what you need to, and act the way you see fit'ìthe trouble you are going to get into for doing that now is so trivial compared to the trouble you're going to get into if this continues for the next ten years that they are not even in the same universe of conceptualisation. To me, by doing what I am doing, I am avoiding trouble, not causing it or not magnifying it for myself. People think what I have landed in constitutes 'hot water' have no idea what 'hot water' is. Compared to any real trouble, the trouble that I am having, it's the trouble of someone who is unbelievably well-protected, who has financial stability, and lives in what's still a free society, and who is protected by tenure. And god, if someone like that can't stand up and say what he has to say out of fear then there's just no hope. If that's how careful I have to be, how is the normal person supposed to be able to talk? You know, I can barely do it and I'm being hyper alert. And that's not free speech'ìthat's barely tolerated speech.

At the United Nations this past week, 123 nations voted to commence negotiations next year on a new treaty to prohibit the possession of nuclear weapons. Despite President Obama's own words in his 2009 pledge to seek the security of a world free of nuclear weapons, the U.S. voted 'no' and led the opposition to this treaty. 
Rather than meet our obligations under international law, the U.S has proposed by stark contrast to begin a new nuclear arms race spending $1 trillion over the next 30 years to 'upgrade' every aspect our nuclear weapons programs. A jobs program to end humanity. Each of the nuclear nations is expected to do the same in rebuilding their weapons programs continuing the arms race for generations to come'îor until planetary thermonuclear murder, whichever comes first. 
The myth of deterrence is the guise for this effort when in fact deterrence is the principle driver of the arms race. For every additional weapon my adversary has, I need two and so on and so on to our global arsenals of 15,500 weapons. 
Fed up with this inaction and doublespeak, the non-nuclear nations of the world have joined the ongoing efforts of the world's NGO, health and religious communities in demanding an end to the madness. Led by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN)'îa global partnership of 440 partners in 98 countries'îalong with the International Red Cross, the world's health associations representing more than 17 million health professionals worldwide, the Catholic Church and World Council of Churches, are all calling for a treaty to ban and eliminate nuclear weapons. 
The effort to ban nuclear weapons has several parallels to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines led by Jody Williams, recipient of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize. This effort was dismissed and called utopian by most governments and militaries of the world when it was launched by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in 1992; then it succeeded in 1997 through partnerships, public imagination and political pressure resulting in the ultimate political will. The nuclear ban movement has been vigorously fought against by the nuclear nations arrogantly persisting in possessing those horrific weapons and pressuring members of their alliances to hold the line. 
Nuclear weapons present the greatest public health and existential threat to our survival every moment of every day. Yet the United States and world nuclear nations stand in breach of the 1968 Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, which commits these nations to work in good faith to end the arms race and to achieve nuclear disarmament. Forty- eight years later the efforts of the nuclear nations toward this goal are not evident and the state of the world is as dangerous as it was during the height of the Cold War. 
This year's presidential campaign has once again done little to focus on the dangers of nuclear weapons, looking instead at who has the temperament to have their finger on the button with absolutely no indication of any understanding of the consequences to all of humanity by the use of these weapons even on a very small scale. In addition to tensions between Russia and the U.S. in Ukraine and Syria, there is a real danger of nuclear war in South Asia, which could kill more than two billion people from the use of 'just' 100 Hiroshima-size weapons. 
Some of rest of the world is finally standing up to this threat to their survival and that of the planet. They are taking matters into their own hands and refusing to be held hostage by the nuclear nations. They will no longer be bullied into sitting back and waiting for the nuclear states to make good on empty promises. 
Unfortunately these weapons and control systems are imperfect. During the Cold War there were many instances where the world came perilously close to nuclear war. It is a matter of sheer luck that this scenario did not come to pass by design or accident. Our luck will not hold out forever. Luck is not a security policy. From a medical and public health stance, our current evidence-based understanding of what nuclear weapons can actually do means any argument for continued possession of these weapons by anyone in untenable and defies logic. There is absolutely no reasonable or adequate medical response to nuclear war. 
As with any public health threat from Zika, to Ebola, Polio, HIV, prevention is the goal. The global threat from nuclear weapons is no different. The only way to prevent the use of nuclear weapons is to ban and eliminate them. Our future depends upon this. 
President Kennedy speaking on nuclear weapons before the U.N. Security Council in September 1961 said, 'The weapons of war must be abolished before they abolish us.' Our children's children will look back and rightly ask why we'ìthe only nation to ever use nuclear weapons'ìremained on the wrong side of history when it came to abolishing nuclear weapons.

If humans were largely moral and ethical beings, then globalization could be a workable proposition. Unfortunately, the dark behavioral narcissism expressed by compulsive greed and an infinite appetite for power seems to have become the guiding precept of our collective nightmare. If only the desire to dominate others and have a lot more than them were not the prime motivations for the global elite on top of the human food chain, we could all have our respective modest slice of happiness on this planet. The Utopia of globalization through institutions such as the United Nations (UN), World Bank , and International Monetary Fund (IMF) was supposed to eradicate the universal pestilence of war, extreme poverty , hunger and slavery using the might of the above supranational institutions to prevent the rise of so-called rogue nations usually ruled by dictators.
World order of chaos with misery for profit
The opportunity of this push for a supranational form of government has to be understood in the psychological context of a world traumatized by World War II. Many public servants, who had fought against the Nazis and their Japanese and Italian allies, had genuinely the best intentions at heart when institutions like the UN were set up. If some of the original ideas were good and moral to some extend, a rot almost immediately contaminated and perverted most of the created institutions and quickly 'î using the pretext of the Cold War 'î allowed the birth of a monstrosity such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ). The globalists have controlled and ultimately Wall Street has financed, supranational government instances such as the UN, IMF, World Bank and a myriad of non-governmental organization (NGO) little helpers. Not only have these done nothing to curtail the man-made disasters of war, climate change , slavery and poverty, but they have exacerbated them, all for the sake of profit.
In this Orwellian time of moral decay, human misery is good for business. In a globalization controlled by Wall Street's puppeteer sociopaths, who believe they are the masters of the universe, ordinary people everywhere have become canon fodder and slave labor. They are not even collateral damage but human lubricant, as viewed by the elite. One can see that if they are not stopped immediately, trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and its Trans-Atlantic counterpart could seal the deal of the establishment of an atrocious world government, controlled by a few thousands, in complete disregard of not only national interest, but also cultural diversity.
Look what happened to Detroit, Michigan, and countless other manufacturing towns in the United States that are all collateral damage of Bill Clinton's North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The massive trade agreements in the works, to be put in place by the globalists if they remain in power, are intended to annihilate any form of economic or political independence from the signatory countries and to scatter their populations to the wind, as in the case in the globalist-controlled demolition of the Middle East in Iraq, Libya and Syria. Displaced and disenfranchised populations are beaten into submission and used as docile worker bees.
Drastic action or hell on earth
If we let the globalists complete their worldwide coup already in progress, then all sovereignty would be lost, and most of the world's population would become slave-wage laborers at the mercy of the global corporate empire. Countries with a diversified agriculture would be turned into one-crop wastelands to ensure that most of the food supply has to be imported. Pseudo local governments would merely officiate as the slave drivers for the global elite. This must be stopped at all cost and undone by all means necessary. If we allow this final coup by the geriatric psychopaths at the top of the current world order, thousands of years of our rich human experience would be wiped out. Like poorly made cheap electronic products, the cultural garbage of the lowest common denominator empire would flood the world. This cultural homogenization would affect primarily the information available to people. Since dissent is impossible without correct information and critical thought, the globalists want their propaganda to become the only source of information. With the UN, the World Bank and the IMF, the political and economic framework financed by a worldwide network of banksters is already in place. Influential nations, on paper, like France and the United Kingdom, which are still officially full fledged members of the UN Security Council, have de facto abdicated their sovereignty to become vassals and secondary enforcers of the globalist plan. We are at the edge of an existential threat of greater magnitude than ever before in human history.
The semantics of deception
Machiavelli is known for his cynical view of political power; however, the advice the author of The Prince gave to the powerful of his time seems innocent by comparison to the depravity of today's puppet masters. Words and ideas are gutted of their meaning to signify, most of the time, the exact opposite. For example, globalist eminence grise George Soros' Open Society Foundation is an opaque giant NGO, with more than 100 offshoots worldwide by its own admission, but its tentacles are in reality more far reaching. The recent publications of Wikileaks in the voluminous Podesta email files have been a revelation of the extent of deception victimizing United States citizens. John Podesta may be viewed as a Soros right-hand man in the US in charge of delivering the returns for the globalist's investments in the US elections. The connection between the two men is not only obvious but also official considering that Soros financed Podesta's so-called Center for American Progress, the fake left equivalent of the neocon think tanks. The term progress is a lure that signifies power, just like Soros' open society is, in reality, an exclusive club as tight as oysters reserved only for Soros' chosen associates to savor. What is apparent from the email treasure trove is that Podesta's job is really to supervise Hillary Clinton on behalf of Soros. In this context, the expression, leader of the free world, to describe the US president becomes a lie. The current world order of the globalists is anything but free, and one applicant for the job, Hillary Clinton, is not a queen on the chessboard, but a pawn.
Axis of resistance: Russia, China and Iran and lessons from Haiti's revolution
One could ask: isn't this psychopathic globalist coup of financiers well on its way? Isn't it a done deal, and how can we resist and salvage anything? The examples of Russia, China and Iran prove that, as national entities, we still can. Germany, Japan and South Korea could reclaim their independence and kick out their US occupation. France and the UK could stop being submissive nations and get out of NATO. That would be a start. The path of war rhetoric expressed by the globalist mouthpieces of the West against Russia, Iran and, to a lesser extent, China has to do with the national resistance of these three countries. The citizenry of Europe and North America should understand, that if such unprecedented conflicts occur, all countries will be on the front line, and there is more than enough fire power on each side to ensure massive destruction and no winning side. Russia, China and Iran are the last national obstacles to the globalist coup, and perhaps we are heading back to a bipolar two-block world order similar to the Cold War era. Other options, including the dismantlement, or at least the curtailment, of supranational organizations such as the UN, World Bank and IMF would surely be the side effects of what appears to be in many countries a revival of nationalism. The final plan of the globalists would be atrocious for all of us. Waving the white flag is not an option. At this critical time of our history, and before our collective enslavement, we should all emulate the brave Haitian slaves who beat not one, but three empires 212 years ago. Haitians were only the last ones to prove that it can be done; it must be redone.

Is a war in the making 'î a third world war?
If there is much talk about such a possibility, it is mainly because of the tensions between the United States and Russia. Tensions between the two most powerful nuclear states in the world have never been this high since the end of the Cold War in 1989 and the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991.
There are at least two flash points, one more dangerous than the other. In Eastern Ukraine, Russian backed rebels will not surrender to the US supported regime in Kiev because they see US control over Ukraine as part of a much larger agenda to expand NATO power to the very borders of Russia. This has been happening for some years now.
But it is the Washington-Moscow confrontation in Allepo, Syria which portends to a huge conflagration. The US is protective of major militant groups such as Al-Nusra which has besieged Eastern Allepo and is seeking to overthrow the Bashar al-Assad government. Washington has also set its sight on 'regime change' in Damascus ever since the latter's determined resistance to Israeli occupation of the strategic Golan Heights in Syria from 1967 onwards.
The drive for regime change intensified with the US-Israeli quest for a 'new Middle East' following the Anglo-American invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003. It became more pronounced in 2009 when Bashar al-Assad rejected a proposal to allow a gas pipe-line from Qatar to Europe to pass through his country, a pipe-line which would have reduced Europe's dependence upon Russia for gas. Russia of course has been a long-standing ally of Syria. Together with Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah, it is helping the Syrian government to break the siege of Eastern Allepo and to defeat militants in other parts of Syria.
It is obvious that in both instances, in Ukraine and Syria, the US has not been able to achieve what it wants. The US has also been stymied in Southeast Asia where its attempt to re-assert its power through its 2010 'Pivot to Asia' policy has suffered a serious setback as a result of the decision of the new president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, to pursue an independent foreign policy that no longer adheres blindly to US interests. At the same time, China continues to expand and enhance its economic strength in Asia and the world through its One Belt One Road (OBOR) projects and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and via its leadership of BRICS. China's regional and global economic role is leading to its pronounced presence in security and military matters. As a result of all this, the US's imperial power has clearly diminished. It is a hegemon in decline.
It is because it is not prepared to accept its decline that some US generals are threatening to demonstrate US's military might. If a hegemon is a danger to humankind when it is at its pinnacle, it becomes an even greater threat to peace when its power is diminishing. Like a wounded tiger, it becomes even more furious and ferocious. A new US president may be inclined to give vent to this frustration through an arrogant display of military power.
How can we check such wanton arrogance? There will be elements in the elite stratum of US society itself who would be opposed to the US going to war. We saw a bit of this in 2013 when those who were itching to launch military strikes against Syria based upon dubious 'evidence' of the government's use of chemical weapons were thwarted by others with a saner view of the consequences of war. It is also important to observe that none of the US's major allies in Europe wants a war. Burdened by severe challenges related to the economy and migration, the governments know that their citizens will reject any move towards war either on the borders of Russia or in Syria and West Asia.
This also suggests that a self-absorbed European citizenry may not have the enthusiasm to mobilise against an imminent war. Let us not forget that it was in European cities from London to Berlin that the biggest demonstrations against the war in Iraq took place in 2003. Anti-war protests will have to be initiated elsewhere this time.
Governments in Moscow and Beijing, in Tehran and Jakarta, in Pretoria and La Paz, should come out openly against war. They should encourage other governments in the Global South and the Global North to denounce any move towards a war that will engulf the whole of humanity. Citizens all over the world should condemn war through a variety of strategies ranging from signature campaigns and letters to the media to public rallies and street demonstrations.
In this campaign against an imminent war, the media, both conventional and alternative, will have a huge role to play. It is unfortunate that well-known media outlets in the West have supported war in the past. It is time that they atone for their sins!

Cameco, the Saskatchewan-based uranium mining colossus, is currently in Federal Court facing charges by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) that it illegally avoided a stunning $2.2 billion in Canadian income taxes. It is not only the largest such case in Canadian history but one of the most shameless tax dodges ever hatched by a Canadian corporation. The court case has been delayed for years and just the fact that it has finally made it before a judge is good news. But the news could quickly turn bad if, facing defeat, Cameco makes a pitch to settle for less than the full amount. That would be a miscarriage of justice.
It is absolutely critical that the government not make a deal with Cameco for a smaller sum 'î as often happens in these cases. Because this is no ordinary case. Cameco is a rogue corporation, contemptuous of the country it operates in, and so arrogant in its tax avoidance scheme that it can't even bother to try to justify it. Confronted by the facts, Cameco just repeats its executive mantra: 'We believe that it was established in accordance with sound business principles and in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.'
At a time when more and more attention is being paid to off-shore tax havens and the billions we lose to them, Canada needs to make an example of this irresponsible corporate 'citizen.'
Here's the bare bones of the scheme. In 1999 Cameco decided to dramatically reduce its income tax bill by setting up a subsidiary in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax rate is 10 per cent 'î compared to the (then) Canadian rate of about 27 per cent. At the time the price was at rock bottom 'î $10 a pound. That's the price the Saskatchewan head office charged its Swiss 'subsidiary.' Then came the windfall manoeuvre: Cameco drafted a 17-year uranium supply agreement at a fixed price of $10 a pound. It was simplicity itself: Cameco would sell literally all of its uranium through the Swiss subsidiary and it would sell it for whatever the world price was. That world price went to almost $140 a pound in 2007 and is now around $35. All the revenue earned above $10 a pound was taxed in Switzerland at the low rate. (An insignificant amount is actually sold in Europe and, of course, not an ounce of the stuff ever finds its way to Zug.)
This scheme is known as 'transfer pricing' and sometimes it is perfectly legitimate 'î companies that sell their products in multiple countries 'sell' them to subsidiaries which then sell them in their jurisdiction and get taxed on the profits. But more and more multinationals have been abusing the law that allows this 'î including Apple, 'based' in Ireland, which is now facing a US$15-billion tax bill from the European Commission for its abuse of transfer pricing.
But Apple actually sold its products in European countries and has 5,500 employees in Ireland. Cameco? Not so much. According to a 2014 Globe and Mail story :
'While Cameco says Cameco Europe has its own board of directors and a full-time CEO, documents in the case reveal the European company had no other full-time employees, and no stand-alone office, instead renting space from the law firm performing its legal work.'
Virtually all the substantive work was performed in Canada.
All of the uranium is mined in Canada, all of Cameco's sales are negotiated and completed in Canada, and literally all of its profits are generated in Canada. The company's scheme is pure scam which is why fair-tax activists in Saskatchewan call the company Scameco. A citizens' group, Saskatchewan Citizens for Tax Fairness, has been on Cameco's case for several years 'î paying for a billboard demanding Cameco pay up and collecting 36,000 names on a petition which it presented to the federal government.
But it isn't just citizens' groups looking askance at Cameco. Investment research firms, like Veritas, have questioned the company's scheme. In 2013 company analyst Pawel Rajszel stated :
'[A]ll the upside has been transferred to the subsidiary. Meanwhile all the risk has stayed with Cameco Canada. '¶ It's strange that the company would have created this Swiss subsidiary without having any real operations in Switzerland.'
A Veritas report concludes: 'It is therefore difficult to see a reasonable business purpose to [Cameco Europe's] existence, beyond tax minimization.' In a further comment, Mr. Rajszel told The Globe and Mail in 2014: 'Based on our review of Cameco's [first quarter] results, the dispute with the CRA may force the company to borrow funds and/or cut its dividend in order to finance the back tax payments.' Does that suggest Cameco's clever tax dodge could actually expose it to a charge of failing to carry out its fiduciary duty to its shareholders?
Another business-focussed group has been sniffing around Cameco's problems. The Bottom Line , a Canadian publication which bills itself as a 'Forensic Accounting and Fraud' magazine, has been in contact with Saskatchewan Citizens for Tax Fairness about the case.
Companies like Cameco have for too long framed the tax haven issue as business as usual. But that is now clearly changing and people are starting to see this behaviour for what it is: the legalized theft of Canadian government services. Cameco started off as a public mining company and its technology was developed in Canada with the help of Saskatchewan government money. The Canadian transportation infrastructure allows them to get their uranium to market, they have enjoyed decades in a stable economy, with low inflation, cheap money, low crime and the legal protection accorded a 'corporate citizen' under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Their workers received free and/or subsidized education and Cameco doesn't have to pay health insurance for its employees 'î as companies in the U.S. do. Adding insult to injury, the (federal) taxes Cameco is avoiding are amongst the lowest in the developed word: 15 per cent compared, for example, to 35 per cent in the U.S.
Ironically 'î or maybe not 'î while the CRA is going after Cameco, Saskatchewan's unabashedly pro-business premier Brad Wall has said almost nothing about the case (the timid NDP opposition has said even less). That seems a bit strange given that Saskatchewan's share of the proceeds, if the CRA wins, would be over $700 million. Governments may govern in the era of globalization, but giant companies rule. It is long past time that we put a stop to it. A great first step would be for the CRA to refuse to negotiate and get all of our money back. Then we need to change the law.

Given the shameless, over-the-top, almost breathtakingly cloying pro-Hillary promotional hype that Michael Moore has been spouting recently (roughly, since mid-July), the only explanation is that this man'îthis pride of Flint, Michigan, this modest film documentarian who grew up middle-class but is now worth upwards of $50 million'îsecretly harbors a desire to play a role in a Hillary Clinton administration.
If not a Cabinet post, then something else. It's more likely he has his eye on an ambassadorship. Maybe he covets being posted in a fun country, preferably a 'resort country,' a country with a temperate climate and friendly people, a country where they speak English and don't get all carried with civil unrest. The Honorable Michael Francis Moore, U.S. Ambassador to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. You have to admit, it has a nice ring to it.
Don't laugh. How do you think people get these ambassadorships? It's never been about anything having to do with 'qualifications.' Ambassadorships are handed out in return for loyal service, in return for an important political favor, in return for keeping a potential troublemaker quiet, and in return for helping to raise a shit-pot of campaign donations. It's 'quid pro quo' writ large.
Of course, when it comes to countries that might actually require a modicum of diplomatic ability, the administration has to be careful. You can't just take someone off the street and make them ambassador to a place like Russia or China or Brazil, not if the U.S. wishes to maintain its credibility. But still, there are plenty of places in the world where you can pretty much dump anybody.
Take President Clinton's administration, for example. In 1994, Bill Clinton rewarded congresswoman Maxine Waters for her long-time support, along with her role in securing African-American votes, by appointing her husband, Sidney Williams, to the post of U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas. Prior to becoming an ambassador, Williams played football in the NFL, and ran a Cadillac dealership in Los Angeles. Life in Nassau was good.
Again: 'Michael Francis Moore: U.S. Ambassador to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas' has a nice ring to it. If not the Bahamas, then how about Barbados? There's whole array of places to pick from. Granted, picturing Moore in a silk top hat and coattails instead of his usual baseball cap and sweatshirt is a bit of a stretch, but with a little coaching, there's no doubt he can pull it off. After all, isn't that why people in these positions have 'personal assistants'?
So best of luck to you, Michael. Let's hope that when you or your 'people' casually mention to Hillary that being an ambassador would be a cool job, she gets the hint. On the other hand, don't count your chickens before they hatch (to coin a phrase). Because this is big-time politics, there will be a long list of people seeking the same job. Debbie Wasserman and Donna Brazile immediately come to mind.

Why isn't the Democratic Party landsliding the worst and cruelest Republican Party in the past 162 years?
Just take a glance at their record votes and you'll wonder why the Republican representatives don't just incorporate themselves and be done with any pretense that they are real people.
A brief look at a compilation of Republican votes during the years 2011-2012, when the Republicans controlled the House, demonstrates that they regularly choose Wall Street over Main Street, drug and oil, banking and insurance companies over consumers. And that Republicans want tiny enforcement budgets against corporate crime to assure that hundreds of billions of your health and other consumer dollars are not recovered from the corporate criminals ($60 billion a year alone in business frauds on Medicare).
Repeatedly, these Republicans, often a unanimous 100% of them, in a bizarre kind of corporate-conditioned response, vote in favor of corporations shipping American jobs overseas rather than voting to protect American workers. This Republican-controlled congress was intent on defending and increasing massive tax breaks for the wealthiest at the expense of the lower income families, attacking Medicare, social security, and other programs assisting elderly Americans, even assaulting women's health and safety, opposing stronger food safety enforcement and preventing toxic pollution controls while at the same time protecting rapacious student loan companies and keeping victims of mortgage companies and banks defenseless against onslaughts of insurmountable debt accumulation.
They also passed a bill to pay members of Congress during a GOP-led government shutdown, however, while refusing to guarantee that soldiers would get paid during the same shutdown. Moreover, the Republicans have this strange antagonism toward encouraging more people to vote, and assuring that every vote counts.
Go past the fa√ßade of the Republican rhetoric praising heroic veterans are their grim votes against protecting veterans from rip-offs as borrowers for their consumer, education and housing needs.
Fast forward to the last two years and you'll find the same corporatist grip on the House. Fifteen times House Republicans have voted for measures attacking women's health; blocked all votes on comprehensive immigration reform; gave the back of their hand against children's well-being; twice voted unanimously against affirming that climate change is real and passed tax cuts of which 99.6 percent go to the richest 1 percent of Americans. Furthermore, they have voted unanimously against even considering a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's 5-4 Citizen's United decision that opened the floodgates of big corporate money in elections. They continue to protect secret money in elections and twice voted against even allowing a vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act giving women new tools for equal pay for equal work.
One hundred percent of all House Republicans voted against allowing a vote to let American workers earn just seven job-protected paid sick days each year 'ì less than has been given for years in western-European countries.
So in hock are they to the student loan industry, the Republicans have repeatedly voted against bringing up for a vote the student loan refinancing bill. One hundred percent of House Republicans voted against even bringing up a bill to stop big companies from dumping their U.S. charter and fleeing abroad to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. Lead-poisoned children in Flint, Michigan got the straight-arm by 236 House Republicans. Republicans held zero hearings in 2016 on the president's 2017 budget 'ì an unheard of breach of legislative duty.
House Republicans in recent years have stupidly cut the IRS budget facilitating $400 billion of uncollected taxes each year, thereby swelling the federal deficit that the GOP is supposed to care about. The Republicans are knowingly complicit in protecting tax evasion.
Worse, these Republicans are complicit in shielding over $330 billion each year in computerized billing fraud. This corporate crime wave estimate comes from the leading expert on billing fraud, Harvard Professor Malcolm Sparrow (author of License to Steal ), backed by an earlier report from the Government Accountability Office of the Congress. There simply is too little budget for adequate investigators and prosecutors even when every dollar in enforcement brings about ten dollars in recoveries and fines!
Why doesn't all of this anti-human record make news? First, these bills are almost always blocked by the Democrats in the Senate. Second, many of these votes by the House Republicans are blocking votes to require on-the-record roll call votes that show each member's position on a bill. Third, let's be clear, the media, which has reporters swarming all over Capitol Hill, is not doing its job.
Fourth, there aren't a tiny fraction of the civically active people back home organized to publicize the votes by their member of Congress. Fifth, the lack of dynamic leadership by Congressional Democrats included being rolled by a Republican strategy to up the GOP's advantage in the number of gerrymandered districts in 2010 (brilliantly reported in David Daley's new book, Ratf**ked: The True Story Behind The Secret Plan to Steal America's Democracy ).
In the final analysis, the blame is on the Democratic Party that does not give us a competitive election process over substantive matters uppermost in the minds of the American people. It took strenuous demands by some civic leaders in Washington, D.C. just to get the House Democrats to compile these aforementioned Republican votes and passively release them in a concise form to the public and then only a month before the November elections! With few exceptions, Democrats astonishingly do not campaign on such a base Republican misery index.
Unfortunately, many Democratic candidates are dialing for the same campaign dollars as their Republican opponents and many Democratic incumbent candidates are ensconced in safe, non-competitive electoral districts (often because of their gerrymandering). Consequently, they don't make an effort to show the callousness and cruelty of the Republican Party.
For any further explanation of this Democratic Party's dysfunctional indifference to winning back the House of Representatives, based on the abysmal record of the Republican Party, call in some social psychologists specializing in group machoism.

Will Trump pull a Brexit times ten? What would it take, beyond WikiLeaks, to bring the Clinton (cash) machine down? Will Hillary win and then declare WWIII against her Russia/Iran/Syria 'axis of evil'? Will the Middle East totally explode? Will the pivot to Asia totally implode? Will China be ruling the world by 2025?
Amidst so many frenetic fragments of geopolitical reality precariously shored against our ruins, the temptation is irresistible to hark back to the late, great, deconstructionist master Jean Baudrillard. During the post-mod 1980s it was hip to be Baudrillardian to the core; his America, originally published in France in 1986, should still be read today as the definitive metaphysical/geological/cultural Instagram of Exceptionalistan.
By the late 1990s, at the end of the millennium, two years before 9/11 'ì that seminal 'before and after' event 'ì Baudrillard was already stressing how we live in a black market maze. Now, it's a black market paroxysm.
Global multitudes are subjected to a black market of work 'ì as in the deregulation of the official market; a black market of unemployment; a black market of financial speculation; a black market of misery and poverty; a black market of sex (as in prostitution); a black market of information (as in espionage and shadow wars); a black market of weapons; and even a black market of thinking.
Way beyond the late 20th century, in the 2010s what the West praises as 'liberal democracy' 'ì actually a neoliberal diktat 'ì has virtually absorbed every ideological divergence, while leaving behind a heap of differences floating in some sort of trompe l'oeil effect. What's left is a widespread, noxious condition; the pre-emptive prohibition of any critical thought, which has no way to express itself other than becoming clandestine (or finding the right internet niche).
Baudrillard already knew that the concept of 'alter' 'ì killed by conviviality 'ì does not exist in the official market. So an 'alter' black market also sprung up, co-opted by traffickers; that's, for instance, the realm of racism, nativism and other forms of exclusion. Baudrillard already identified how a 'contraband alter', expressed by sects and every form of nationalism (nowadays, think about the spectrum between jihadism and extreme-right wing political parties) was bound to become more virulent in a society that is desperately intolerant, obsessed with regimentation, and totally homogenized.
There could be so much exhilaration inbuilt in life lived in a bewildering chimera cocktail of cultures, signs, differences and 'values'; but then came the coupling of thinking with its exact IT replica 'ì artificial intelligence, playing with the line of demarcation between human and non-human in the domain of thought.
The result, previewed by Baudrillard, was the secretion of a parapolitical society 'ì with a sort of mafia controlling this secret form of generalized corruption (think the financial Masters of the Universe). Power is unable to fight this mafia 'ì and that would be, on top of it, hypocritical, because the mafia itself emanates from power.
The end result is that what really matters today, anywhere, mostly tends to happen outside all official circuits; like in a social black market.
Is there any information 'truth'?
Baudrillard showed how political economy is a massive machine, producing value, producing signs of wealth, but not wealth itself. The whole media/information system 'ì still ruled by America 'ì is a massive machine producing events as signs; exchangeable value in the universal market of ideology, the star system and catastrophism.
This abstraction of information works as in the economy 'ì disgorging a coded material, deciphered in advance, and negotiable in terms of models, as much as the economy disgorges products negotiable in terms of price and value.
Since all merchandise, thanks to this abstraction of value, is exchangeable, then every event (or non-event) is also exchangeable, all replacing one another in the cultural market of information.
And that takes us to where we live now; Trans-History, and Trans-Politics 'ì where events have really not happened, as they get lost in the vacuum of information (as much as the economy gets lost in the vacuum of speculation).
Thus this quintessential Baudrillard insight; if we consider History as a movie 'ì and that's what it is now 'ì then the 'truth' of information is no more than post-production synch, dubbing and subtitles.
Still, as we all keep an intense desire for devouring events, there is immense disappointment as well, because the content of information is desperately inferior to the means of broadcasting them. Call it a pathetic, universal contagion; people don't know what to do about their sadness or enthusiasm 'ì in parallel to our societies becoming theaters of the absurd where nothing has consequences.
No acts, deeds, crimes (the 2008 financial crisis), political events (the WikiLeaks emails showing virtually no distinction between the 'nonprofit' Clinton cash machine, what's private and what's public, the obsessive pursuit of personal wealth, and the affairs of the state)
seem to have real consequences.
Immunity, impunity, corruption, speculation 'ì we veer towards a state of zero responsibility (think Goldman Sachs). So, automatically, we yearn for an event of maximum consequence, a 'fatal' event to repair that scandalous non-equivalence. Like a symbolic re-equilibrium of the scales of destiny.
So we dream of an amazing event 'ì Trump winning the election? Hillary declaring WWIII? 'ì that would free us from the tyranny of meaning and the constraint of always searching for the equivalence between effects and causes.
Shadowing the world
Just like Baudrillard, I got to see 'deep' America in the 1980s and 1990s by driving across America.
So sooner or later one develops a metaphysical relationship with that ubiquitous warning, 'Objects in this mirror may be closer than they appear.'
But what if they may also be further than they appear?
The contemporary instant event/celebrity culture deluge of images upon us; does it get us closer to a so-called 'real' world that is in fact very far away from us? Or does it in fact keep the world at a distance 'ì creating an artificial depth of field that protects us from the imminence of objects and the virtual danger they represent?
In parallel, we keep slouching towards a single future language 'ì the language of algorithms, as designed across the Wall Street/Silicon Valley axis 'ì that would represent a real anthropological catastrophe, just like the globalist/New World Order dream of One Thought and One Culture.
Languages are multiple and singular 'ì by definition. If there were a single language, words would become univocal, regulating themselves in an autopilot of meaning. There would be no interplay 'ì as in artificial languages there's no interplay. Language would be just the meek appendix of a unified reality 'ì the negative destiny of a languidly unified human species.
That's where the American 'dream' seems to be heading. It's time to take the next exit ramp.

Picture, if you will, video footage of vintage (early 2016) Donald Trump buffoonery with the CEO of CBS Leslie Moonves commenting on major media's choice to give Trump vastly more air time than other candidates: 'It may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS.'
That's the introduction to a powerful critique of the U.S. media. A new film screens in New York and Los Angeles this week called All Governments Lie: Truth, Deception, and the Spirit of I.F. Stone .
The website AllGovernmentsLie.com has screening dates , a list of lies , and a list of good journalists who expose lies . The lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film, but there's a good deal of overlap 'î enough to give you a sense of what this project is about.
I'd have made various changes and additions to the film. In particular, I'm tired of all the focus on Iraq 2003. This film touches on war lies since then, but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence.
Still, this is a film that should be shown in cities, homes, and classrooms across the United States. It includes and is driven by Noam Chomsky's analysis of how the media system is 'rigged' without those doing the rigging believing they've done anything at all. It's a survey of skullduggery by corporate media. It's an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm. And it's an introduction to I.F. Stone. It includes footage of a presentation of the annual Izzy Award which goes to journalists acting in Stone's tradition.
One of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the Gulf of Tonkin (non-)Incident. Anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie. And it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense. That is: had the North Vietnamese really shot back at a U.S. ship off their coast, that would not have been any sort of legal, much less moral, justification for escalating a war. I'd love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the Black Sea, the Red Sea, and every other part of the earth today.
But the Gulf of Tonkin lies about Vietnamese aggression against the U.S. ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of Vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the U.S. role of Global Policeman. Someone had to make the lies transparent. Someone had to document that in fact the Secretary of So-Called Defense and the President were lying. Sadly, nobody did that in the first 24 hours after the Congressional committee hearings, and that was all it took for Congress to hand the president a war.
And it was decades before White House transcripts came out and before the National Security Agency confessed, and additional years before former Secretary Robert McNamara did. Yet, those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew. And they knew it because of I.F. Stone who just weeks after the (non-)incident published a four-page edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about Tonkin.
Stone's analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the Red Sea off Yemen. And in fact it is to Yemen that Stone immediately turned on page 1 in 1964. The United Nations, including its U.S. ambassador, had recently condemned British attacks on Yemen that Britain defended as retaliatory. President Dwight Eisenhower had also warned the French against retaliatory attacks on Tunisia. And President Lyndon Johnson, even at the time of Tonkin, Stone notes, was warning Greece and Turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other.
Stone, who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to, pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks: the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the U.N. Charter. The latter two are still theoretically in place for the U.S. government.
The United States in Vietnam, Stone goes on to show, could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of Vietnamese boats. And indeed the U.S. ships, Stone reports, were in North Vietnamese waters and were there to assist South Vietnamese ships that were shelling two North Vietnamese islands. And in fact those ships had been supplied to South Vietnam by the U.S. military and the good old American tax payers.
Stone did not have access to closed committee hearings, but he hardly needed it. He considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war. And then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees. He found their denials to be non-denials and nonsensical. It made no sense that the U.S. ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the South Vietnamese ships. Stone didn't believe it.
Stone also filled in the background information. The United States had been supporting guerrilla attacks on North Vietnam for years prior to the non-incident. And Stone raised numerous suspicions, including the question of why the U.S. ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the (non-)incident to (not) occur, and the question of why in the world Vietnam would take on the United States military (something nobody could explain, though Eugene McCarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored).
Missing from the film and website of All Governments Lie is I.F. Stone's work on lies about the outbreak of the Korean War. We've learned more since he wrote it, but seen little more insightful, relevant, or timely for our understanding of Korea and the world today.

We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible.'
'ìProclamation of Easter Week 1916
Controlling their own destiny has always been a bit of a preoccupation for the Irish, in large part because for 735 years someone else was in charge. From the Norman invasion in 1169 to the establishment of the Free State in 1922, Ireland's political and economic life was not its own to determine. Its young men were shipped off to fight England's colonial battles half a world away, at Isandlwana, Dum Dum, Omdurman and Kut. Almost 50,000 died in World War I, choking on gas at Ypres, clinging desperately to a beachhead at Gallipoli, or marching into German machine guns at the Somme.
When the Irish finally cast off their colonial yoke, they pledged never again to be cannon fodder in other nation's wars, a pledge that has now been undermined by the U.S. Once again, a powerful nation'îwith the acquiescence of the Dublin government'îhas put the Irish in harm's way.
The flashpoint for this is Shannon Airport, located in County Clare on Ireland's west coast. Since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attack on Washington and New York, some 2.5 million U.S. troops have passed through the airport on their way to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. The Shannon hub has become so important to the U.S. that it hosts a permanent U.S. staff officer to direct traffic. It is, in the words of the peace organization Shannonwatch , 'a US forward operating base.'
The airport has also been tied to dozens of CIA 'rendition' flights, where prisoners seized in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan were shipped to various 'black sites' in Europe, Asia, and Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.
Irish peace activists and members of the Irish parliament, or Oireachtas Elreann, charge that an agreement between the Irish government and Washington to allow the transiting of troops and aircraft through Shannon not only violates Irish neutrality it violates international law.
'The logistical support for the U.S. military and CIA at Shannon is a contravention of Ireland's neutrality,' says John Lannon of the peace group Shannonwatch, and has 'contributed to death, torture, starvation, forced displacement and a range of other human rights abuses.'
Ireland is not a member of NATO, and it is considered officially neutral. But 'neutral' in Ireland can be a slippery term. The government claims that Ireland is 'militarily neutral''îit doesn't belong to any military alliances'îbut not 'politically neutral.'
But the term militarily neutral 'does not exist in international law,' says Karen Devine, an expert on neutrality at the City of Dublin's School of Law & Government. 'The decision to aid belligerents in war is'¶incompatible with Article 2 of the Fifth Hague Convention on the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land.' Devine argues that 'the Irish government's decision to permit the transit of hundreds of thousands of U.S. soldiers through Shannon Airport on their way to the Iraq War in 2003 violated international law on neutrality and set it apart from European neutrals who refused such permission.'
Article 2 of the Convention states, 'Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions or war supplies across the territory of a neutral power.'
Ireland has not ratified the Hague Convention but according to British international law expert Iain Scobbie, the country is still bound by international law because Article 29 of the Irish Constitution states, 'Ireland accepts the generally recognized principle of international law as its rule of conduct in relations with other states.'
The UN Security Council did not endorse the wars in Afghanistan or Iraq, making both conflicts technically illegal. Then UN General Secretary Kofi Annan said that the invasions 'were not in conformity with the UN Charter. From our point of view, from the Charter's point of view,' the invasions were 'illegal.'
Shannonwatch's Lannon says the agreement also violates the 1952 Air Navigation Foreign Military Aircraft Order that requires that 'aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition and explosives, and must not engage in intelligence gathering and that the flights in question must not form part of a military exercises or operations.'
The Dublin government claims all US aircraft adhere to the 1952 order, although it refuses to inspect aircraft or allow any independent inspection. According to retired Irish Army Captain Tom Clonan, the Irish Times security analyst, the soldiers are armed but leave their weapons on board the transports'îgenerally Hercules C-130s'îwhile they stretch their legs after the long cross Atlantic flight. Airport employees have also seen soldiers with their weapons.
The Irish government also says that it has been assured that no rendition flights have flown through Shannon, but Shannonwatch activists have tracked flights in and out of the airport. As for 'assurances,' Washington 'assured' the British government that no rendition flights used British airports, but in 2008 then Foreign Secretary Ed Miliband told Parliament that such flights did use the United Kingdom controlled island of Diego Garcia.
Investigative journalist's Mark Danner's book Spiral: Trapped in the Forever War chronicles the grotesque nature of some of the 'enhanced interrogation' techniques inflicted on those prisoners. The rendition program violated the 1987 UN Convention Against Torture, which Ireland is a party to.
Roslyn Fuller , Dublin-based scholar and author of Beasts and Gods: How Democracy Changed Its Meaning And Lost Its Way , says terror suspects were taken to sites where 'in an appalling re-run of the Spanish Inquisition tactics, [they were] routinely tortured and mistreated in an attempt to obtain confessions and other information.'
Fuller points out that Article 11 of the Hague Convention requires that troops belonging to a 'belligerent' army must be interned. 'In other words, any country that would like to call itself neutral is obligated to prevent warring parties from moving troops though its territory and to gently scoop up anyone attempting to contravene this principle.'
Besides violating international law, Ireland is harvesting 'the bitter fruits of the Iraq and Afghan wars' and NATO's military intervention in Libya, charges MP Richard Boyd Barrett of the People Before Profit Party and chair of the Irish Anti-War Movement. 'The grotesque images of children and families washed up on Europe's shores, desperate refugees, risking and losing their lives,' he says, 'are the direct result of disastrous wars waged by the US, the UK and other major western powers over the last 12 years.'
The Irish government, says Barrett, has 'colluded with war crimes and actions for which we are now witnessing the most terrible consequences.'
The government has waived all traffic control costs on military flights, costing Dublin about $45 million from 2003 to 2015. Ireland is currently running one of the highest per capita debts in Europe and has applied austerity measures that have reduced pensions and severely cut social services, health programs and education. Other neutral European countries, like Finland, Austria and Switzerland charge the US military fees for using their airspace.
Shannon might also make Ireland collateral damage in the war on terror, according to the Irish Times' Clonan. Irish citizens are now seen as a 'hostile party,' and British Muslim cleric Anjem Choudary has named Shannon a 'legitimate target,' according to Irish journalist Danielle Ryan.
The Dublin government has generally avoided open discussion of the issue, and when it comes up, ministers tend to get evasive. In response to the charge that Shannon hosted rendition flights, then Minister of Foreign Affairs Dermot Ahern said, 'If anyone has evidence of any of these flights please give me a call and I will have it investigated.' But even though Amnesty International produced flights logs for 50 rendition landings at Shannon, the government did nothing. Investigations by the Council on Europe and European Parliament also confirmed rendition flights through Shannon.
Peace activists charge that attempts to raise the issue in the Irish parliament have met with a combination of stonewalling and half-truths. Apparently kissing the Blarney Stone is not just for tourists.
The government's position finds little support among the electorate. Depending on how the questions are asked, polls indicate that between 55 and 58 percent of the Irish oppose allowing US transports to land at Shannon, and between 57 to 76 percent want to add a neutrality clause to the constitution.
The 'forward base' status of Shannon puts the west of Ireland in the crosshairs in the event of a war with Russia. While that might seem far-fetched, in 2015 NATO held 14 military maneuvers directed at Russia, and relations between NATO, the US and Moscow are at their lowest point since the height of the Cold War.
Of course Ireland is not alone in putting itself in harm's way. The US has more than 800 bases worldwide, bases that might well be targeted in a nuclear war with China or Russia. Local populations have little say over the construction of these bases, but they would be the first casualties in a conflict.
For centuries Ireland was colonialism's laboratory. The policies used to enchain its people'îreligious division and ethnic hatred'î were tested out and then shipped off to India, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria and Guyana, and Irish soldiers populate colonial graveyards on all four continents, now, once again, Ireland has been drawn into a conflict that is has no stake in.
Not that the Irish have taken this lying down. Scores of activists have invaded Shannon to block military flights and, on occasion, to attack aircraft with axes and hammers. 'Pit stop of death' was one slogan peace demonstrators painted on a hanger at the airport.
That resistance harkens back to the 1916 Easter Rebellion's proclamation that ends with the words that ring as true today as they did a century ago: 'In this supreme hour the Irish nation must, by its valor and discipline and by the readiness of its children to sacrifice themselves for the common good, prove itself worthy of the august destiny to which it is called.'

Globalization and technology are routinely cited as drivers of inequality over the last four decades. While the relative importance of these causes is disputed, both are often viewed as natural and inevitable products of the working of the economy, rather than as the outcomes of deliberate policy. In fact, both the course of globalization and the distribution of rewards from technological innovation are very much the result of policy. Insofar as they have led to greater inequality, this has been the result of conscious policy choices.
Starting with globalization, there was nothing pre-determined about a pattern of trade liberalization that put U.S. manufacturing workers in direct competition with their much lower paid counterparts in the developing world. Instead, that competition was the result of trade pacts written to make it as easy as possible for U.S. corporations to invest in the developing world to take advantage of lower labor costs, and then ship their products back to the United States. The predicted and actual result of this pattern of trade has been to lower wages for manufacturing workers and non-college educated workers more generally, as displaced manufacturing workers crowd into other sectors of the economy.
Instead of only putting manufacturing workers into competition with lower-paid workers in other countries, our trade deals could have been crafted to subject doctors, dentists, lawyers and other highly-paid professionals to international competition. As it stands, almost nothing has been done to remove the protectionist barriers that allow highly-educated professionals in the United States to earn far more than their counterparts in other wealthy countries.
This is clearest in the case of doctors. For the most part, it is impossible for foreign-trained physicians to practice in the United States unless they have completed a residency program in the United States. The number of residency slots, in turn, is strictly limited, as is the number of slots open for foreign medical students. While this is a quite blatantly protectionist restriction, it has persisted largely unquestioned through a long process of trade liberalization that has radically reduced or eliminated most of the barriers on trade in goods. The result is that doctors in the United States earn an average of more than $250,000 a year, more than twice as much as their counterparts in other wealthy countries. This costs the country roughly $100 billion a year in higher medical bills compared to a situation in which U.S. doctors received the same pay as doctors elsewhere. Economists, including trade economists, have largely chosen to ignore the barriers that sustain high professional pay at enormous economic cost.
In addition to the items subject to trade, the overall trade balance is also very much the result of policy choices. The textbook theory has capital flowing from rich countries to poor countries, which means that rich countries run trade surpluses with poor countries. While this accurately described the pattern of trade in the 1990s up until the East Asian financial crisis (a period in which the countries of the region enjoyed very rapid growth), in the last two decades developing countries taken as a whole have been running large trade surpluses with wealthy countries.
This implies large trade deficits in rich countries, especially the United States, which in turn has meant a further loss of manufacturing jobs with the resulting negative impact on wage inequality. However, there was nothing inevitable about the policy shifts associated with the bailout from the East Asian financial crisis that led the developing world to become a net exporter of capital.
The pattern of gains from technology has been even more directly determined by policy than is the case with gains from trade. There has been a considerable strengthening and lengthening of patent and copyright and related protections over the last four decades. The laws have been changed to extend patents to new areas such as life forms, business methods, and software. Copyright duration has been extended from 55 years to 95 years. Perhaps even more important, the laws have become much more friendly to holders of these property claims to tilt legal proceedings in their favor, with courts becoming more patent-friendly and penalties for violations becoming harsher. And, the United States has placed stronger intellectual property (IP) rules at center of every trade agreement negotiated in the last quarter century.
In this context, it would hardly be surprising if the development of 'technology' was causing an upward redistribution of income. The people in a position to profit from stronger IP rules are almost exclusively the highly educated and those at the top end of the income distribution. It is almost definitional that stronger IP rules will result in an upward redistribution of income.
This upward redistribution could be justified if stronger IP rules led to more rapid productivity growth, thereby benefitting the economy as a whole. However, there is very little evidence to support that claim. Michele Boldrin and David Levine have done considerable research on this topic and generally found the opposite. My own work , using cross-country regressions with standard measures of patent strength, generally found a negative and often significant relationship between patent strength and productivity growth.
There is also a substantial amount of money at stake. In the case of prescription drugs alone, the United States is on path to spend more than $430 billion in 2016 for drugs that would likely cost one-tenth of this amount in the absence of patent and related protections. While we do need mechanisms for financing innovation and creative work, it is almost certainly the case that patent and copyright monopolies as currently structured are not the most efficient route, even if their negative consequences for distribution are quite evident.
The structuring of trade and rules on IP are two important ways in which policy has been designed to redistribute income upward over the last four decades. There are many other ways in which the market has been structured to disadvantage those at the middle and bottom of the income distribution, perhaps most notably macroeconomic policies that result in high unemployment. While tax and transfer policies that reduce poverty and inequality may be desirable, we should also be aware of the ways in which policy has been designed to increase inequality. It is much easier to have an economic system that produces more equality rather than one that needlessly generates inequality, which we then try to address with redistributive policies.

All is fair in love and war, and this particular electoral battle in US politics has assumed more belligerent proportions than most. Neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton genuinely deserve to be in the White House, but elections are rarely fought, let alone won, on the issue of the deserving.
As the election moves into it's the cracker phase, Trump is scrapping his way back in the polls, ever the immeasurable factor in this election. For the establishment, the battle is already won, creating a dangerous sense of entitlement for the Democratic nominee.
That sense of entitlement shone through in the latest fury from the Clinton campaign, nervous about the FBI's foray into the last days of this election. As ever, it was that seedy matter of emails sent on a private server when she was Secretary of State that came bobbing back up.
On Friday, Director James B. Comey sent a letter to the US Congress noting that he was wishing, due to 'recent developments' to 'supplement' previous testimony on the previous and closed investigation into Clinton's use of a private server. 'In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.' [1]
That unrelated case involved emails discovered on the laptop of disgraced former congressman Anthony D. Weiner, and a Clinton aide and Weiner's estranged wife, Huma Abedin. Clinton found herself back in the frame.
Imaginations started to gallop, notably at the open nature of the remarks. The investigation would involve the old issue of whether classified information had been involved, and whether relevant emails would be pertinent to the investigation.
No sense of scope, length or frame of the investigation was given: 'Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.'
Previously, Comey railroaded efforts to bring charges against Clinton's misuse of classified material despite noting 'evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of information.' In so doing, he did acknowledge that prosecutors ponder a 'number of factors before bringing charges.' These include 'the context of a person's actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past' and 'the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent.'
While his then recommendation for non-prosecution was hardly binding on the Attorney-General, it would have been irregular to expect a prosecution in absence of hearty approval from the FBI. The result, or so thought those manning the barricades of the Clinton campaign, was permitted to rest.
This naturally unleashed a hailstorm of speculation from such figures as Rush Limbaugh, who pondered whether there had been an element of connivance between the Obama administration, Comey and Clinton. Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch saw 'a disconnect between Comey's devastating findings and his weak recommendation not to prosecute Hillary Clinton.' [2]
This 'disconnect' has been a feature of the entire discussion about Email Gate. For one, President Barack Obama, despite being an enthusiast for prosecuting whistleblowers who disclose classified information for a perceived higher ideal for information transparency, did not see a legal problem with Clinton's use of a personal email server.
It was 'not a situation in which America's national security was endangered' even if it was imprudent. [3] Rather confidently, and in a manner befitting premature judgement, Obama insisted in April this year that Clinton 'would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy.'
Certain outlets of legal commentary, notably Lawfare , have taken note about the entire background surrounding Comey's moves as murky and compromising for a range of parties. Attorney-General Loretta Lynch, for one, had been compromised by the President's certitude on the subject of Clinton's behaviour, a point made even more complicated by a promise 'ì albeit one made by Clinton 'ì that Lynch would continue to remain AG in her administration. [4]
In then testifying before Congress about his own decision not to prosecute, an investigation was essentially being given dramatic air time. Truly, we were bearing witness to another Clinton saga, the legal equivalent of constipation in an ailing Republic. 'As a general matter,' lamented Benjamin Wittes of the Brookings Institution, 'when prosecutors and investigators decline to indict someone, we don't want a report, much less congressional oversight of the unindicted conduct. We want them to shut the heck up.' [5]
There was, however, no shutting up Comey, who is making more electoral history than is customary for a law enforcement organisation. It baffled Clinton, who has persistently wished the email matter to disappear in a confusing haze. Nor did Comey listen to senior Justice Department officials, who attempted to dissuade the move to send the letter. [6] 'Never in recent history,' claimed the New York Times , 'has the FBI been so enmeshed in a presidential race.' [7]
The FBI director's intervention has already inflicted range of shocks, though it is imprecise to what extent his own announcement will alter set minds or convince the confused. Trump, most certainly, was emboldened, and the unpopularity contest is set for a few more hiccups prior to the November 8 poll.

Alabama's last execution may have burned a man alive because the 'consciousness assessment' it administers is about as scientific as someone jostling you when you nod off on the sofa.
This is clear from the firsthand account of Ms. Terry Deep, a federal investigator who witnessed the execution of Christopher Brooks at Holman Prison in Atmore, Alabama on January 21, 2016.
Ms. Deep signed a sworn affidavit attached as an exhibit to an April 15, 2016 court filing in the case of Ronald Bert Smith detailing these observations; Mr. Smith is scheduled for execution in Alabama on December 8, 2016, and his federal defenders also represented Christopher Brooks.
Ms. Deep's account goes like this:
'After the Warden called for order and read the execution warrant, Mr. Brooks made his final statement. Warden Davenport then left the execution chamber, leaving [a correctional officer, identified only as D.F.] and the prison chaplain in the execution chamber. The chaplain walked over to Mr. Brooks, held his hand, and stepped away. Mr. Brooks' breathing became rapid and shallow. D.F. called out Mr. Brooks' name, raised his eyelids and reached behind Mr. Brooks' left arm momentarily. Mr. Brooks' eyes were closed at the end of this activity. D.F. stepped away from Mr. Brooks. Mr. Brooks' breathing further slowed. Before the curtains were closed, Mr. Brooks' left eye opened, and was still open when the execution chamber curtains were closed.'
Using these critical observations, federal defenders based in Montgomery, Alabama, cogently argue that:
[Alabama's] execution protocol uses potassium chloride, a drug that unquestionably causes an unconstitutional level of pain [.] [Alabama does] not intend to anesthetize [Ronald Smith]; rather, they intend to use a sedative with no analgesic properties to create the illusion of adequate anesthesia. [Alabama's] protocol further creates an illusion of adequate anesthesia by having an untrained corrections officer conduct a 'consciousness assessment' to determine whether an inmate is anesthetized prior to injection of potassium chloride, a drug that, if injected without adequate anesthesia, indisputably causes an unconstitutional level of pain.
Because of the way midazolam works in the human body, it could sedate an individual to the point where he was incapable of communicating that he was in pain while doing nothing to suppress the experience of pain. Because midazolam is a sedative and not an analgesic, there is a high likelihood that an inmate who receives a high dose of midazolam would be unable to respond to the noxious stimuli that constitute the ADOC's consciousness check, but would still feel the excruciating effects of the second and third drugs.
In layman's terms, what the public defenders are saying is, as human beings, if we insist on pumping caustic, corrosive drugs into other human beings, our Constitution, and specifically the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, demands it not cause excruciating pain.
In the case of lethal injection, I respectfully submit, this is an impossible burden to satisfy because (1) thankfully, exterminating human beings is hardly an exact science, and (2) corrections officers who execute in Alabama, and for that matter nationwide 'ì whose government paychecks come with a duty to kill 'ì are not, when it comes to administering lethal injections, the sharpest tools in the shed. See Stephanie Mencimer, 'State Executioners: Untrained, Incompetent, and 'Complete Idiots'' ( Mother Jones , May 7, 2014) (quoting Dr. Jay Chapman, the Oklahoma coroner who helped create the modern lethal injection protocol, who observed in The New York Times in 2007, 'It never occurred to me when we set this up that we'd have complete idiots administering the drugs.').
In Alabama's executions, including Mr. Brooks', the critical 'consciousness assessment' the federal public defenders say, 'is performed by a corrections officer who has received no medical training, whereas anesthesiologists receive extensive training in order to assess a patient's depth of anesthesia. Not only must they graduate from college and medical school, they must follow this with four years of training before they can be certified to practice anesthesiology without supervision.'
Anesthesiologists (the reputable ones in the U.S. at least), however, won't help Alabama, or any other state, to whitewash 'ì using a seemingly mundane and sterile-looking medical procedure 'ì the violent torture that lethal injection is. As Dr. J. Jeffrey Andrews, Secretary of The American Board of Anesthesiology wrote in May of 2014:
'[We] should never confuse the death chamber with the operating room, lethal doses of execution drugs with anesthetic drugs, or the executioner with the anesthesiologist. Physicians should not be expected to act in ways that violate the ethics of medical practice, even if these acts are legal. Anesthesiologists are healers, not executioners.'
Furthermore, as the federal defenders in Alabama highlight, even if anesthesiologists did violate their professional code of ethics and participate in the ignominy of public executions (and specifically, the grim but oh so important 'consciousness assessment'):
'[A]nesthesiologists do not take such action based solely on a manual assessment, they also rely on the use of devices that monitor vital signs. The events of Christopher Brooks' execution indicate that Defendants' crude assessment conducted by an individual with no medical training creates a substantial risk of pain in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Mr. Brooks' left eye opened after the consciousness assessment and assuming they even noticed, no one from the ADOC took any action.'
The late Dr. Jack Kevorkian, nicknamed 'Dr. Death,' was once, according to his New York Times obituary, called 'a reckless instrument of death' who 'poses a great threat to the public.' But, compared to corrections officers on the execution squad in Alabama, at least when Kevorkian sent people to their deaths, he had some medical training and whatever their efficacy, he used machines.
In a 1958 paper Kevorkian once authored called, 'Capital Punishment or Capital Gain?,' Quote: :
'Most of us are well aware that the ultimate 'laboratory' for testing every medical fact, concept or device is man himself '¶. In this logical and proper sequence of trial, the human subject at the end, the ' guinea pig ,' is and always will be, the most difficult link to procure '¶. Viewing the problem purely realistically, capital punishment as it exists today, offers an unrivaled opportunity [.]' (emphasis added)
It would appear the State of Alabama agrees.

After some considerable anticipation, it seemed that the much awaited October Surprise had arrived with the revelation that John Podesta, HRC's right hand man, had a bona fide email addiction after having been publicly identified by Wikileaks as the author of a massive quantity of damaging emails.
As scandal-weary voters are threatened with serious cerebral overload, the continuing array of titillating revelations spanned from naming the MSM names in collusion with the Democrats to an otherwise obscure reporter suggesting that Podesta link Russia to Trump to a multitude of documents identifying the Clinton Foundation as a vehicle for nefarious dealings 'ì and a host of unethical examples of how to steal democracy, the rank-and-file continues to look the other way, clinging to the illusion that Democrats are the good guys, the white hats for social change.
Beginning with the DNC scandal in July which revealed a host of pre-meditated efforts to undermine the Bernie Sanders campaign and steal the nomination, the question remains whether a candidate nominated as a result of a flawed, if not legally flawed, Democratic primary process could be considered a politically legitimate candidate for the general election and the office of US President. The Clinton campaign apparently never felt the need to resolve that question.
Since the Wikileaks emails were not a total surprise, it would now appear that the real October Surprise is FBI Director James B. Comey's dramatic turn-around announcement on October 28th that the Clinton email investigation was being re-opened due to new information as a result of its investigation into Carlos Danger.
Comey, who reportedly had been privately criticized by disgruntled agents in his department for the dismissal of felony charges against Clinton, informed pertinent Congressional Committee Chairs and ranking Democrats of the renewed investigation in an unusual letter on Friday. Acknowledging that the agency had previously 'completed its investigation,' Comey said that 'due to recent developments' the FBI had 'learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.' Comey continued that after having been briefed by the FBI's investigative team, he 'agreed that the FBI should take proper investigative steps' to 'determine whether they (the emails) contain classified information .'
To put the current crisis in context, several days after the FBI's original announcement in July, Rep. Curt Gowdy's (R-SC) conducted a vigorous cross examination of Comey that was devastating to the FBI's 'no charge' determination and its no proof of intent determination that was, in turn, irreparably damaging to Secretary Clinton's credibility. In other words, backed into a corner by Gowdy, Comey confirmed that Clinton had misrepresented the facts. Comey's responses should have been front page headlines but received barely a ripple from the MSM which Wikileaks confirmed takes its marching orders from the DNC.
In response to the newest FBI investigation that surfaced on Friday, Secretary Clinton has demanded , contrary to standard procedure, that the FBI 'release all of the information that it has' and 'needs to share whatever facts they have with the American people' and 'it is deeply troubling because voters deserve to get full and complete facts' without any recognition of the irony.
Secretary Clinton is, of course, a subject of interest of the renewed investigation and understands that the purpose of a reopened investigation is to ferret out the facts. Rather than shoot from the hip to conform with candidate Clinton's demands, Comey has the responsibility to conduct a thorough investigation free from political intimidation as should have occurred in July. While the public can only speculate on the real backstory, if there is one, prompting the FBI to initiate this current investigation, surely Comey understands what is on the line here. For the FBI to come back at some future time with another 'no charges' determination, everyone go home folks, there's nothing more to see, would irredeemably and irretrievably doom the FBI, which is already on thin ice, and further drive a once-Constitutional democracy into the ditch.
As the Democrats continue to circle the wagons, counting on some mindless Democrat to continue its nonsensical anti-Russian agenda, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Oh) stepped forward to link the FBI with Putin as the true source of the new stash of emails which were found on the home computer of former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-NY), estranged husband of HRC's long-time confidante Huma Abedin. FBI officials first estimated ' tens of thousands of emails' belonging to Ms. Abedin but have since revised its estimate to 650,000 emails which may include some of the missing 33,000 emails previously erased and may have been sent to and from Secretary Clinton's private email server.
Following the thread, if we assume that a percentage of Ms. Abedin's emails were 'classified' or 'top secret' (which is a reasonable assumption) and that her husband, who has repeatedly exhibited gross lapses of judgment, had free and open access to his own computer, the question that terrifies the Democrats is not knowing the content of Abedin emails contained in Weiner's laptop.
As if to throw oil on a bonfire, it was reported over the weekend that Comey's decision to reopen the Clinton investigation was done against Attorney General Loretta Lynch's recommendation. You may recall in July, Lynch participated in a highly controversial tarmac meeting with former President Bill Clinton 'ì just days prior to Comey's announcement that there would be no criminal charges against Hilary Clinton.
Looking back on the July announcement may factor into Comey's role in the current controversy. It is, of course, FBI Director's job to conduct an investigation and it is the Attorney General's decision whether or not to pursue prosecution. Given that the Lynch 'ì Clinton tarmac meeting was widely publicized, a good guess is that the political players decided it more appropriate for Comey to do the 'no charges' announcement rather than Lynch 'ì who was already being publicly castigated for favoring Clinton by meeting with Big Bill. Lynch took the easy way with Comey being sent to face the public ire and take the heat.
According to Jane Mayer of The New Yorker , Lynch was opposed to Comey's letter to Congress and opposed to not following DOJ practice of no comment or involvement regarding any political campaign as it could be interpreted as attempting to 'influence' a campaign 'ì which has become a frequent refrain this season as the Clinton campaign continues to flail with a frantic desperation, a willingness to discredit anyone whose presence threatens their path to the White House 'ì Russian President Vladimir Putin, Republican candidate Donald Trump, Wikileaks' Julian Assange and now FBI Director James Comey.
Against that background, on Friday Comey was in the position of sitting on potentially explosive new information and taking the risk he would be publicly slammed for favoring Clinton and attempting to influence the election. According to Mayer's sources, Comey felt 'compelled' to go forward with the letter and reopen the Clinton case against the DOJ recommendation.
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump (DCAT) has filed a formal Complaint with the Department of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility against Comey for 'interfering in the Presidential election' citing the Hatch Act which prohibits federal employees from participating in politically partisan acts.
In an imprudent display of anguish from the Clinton campaign, Scott Dworkin, senior advisor to the DCAT, said 'it is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Trump like this with only eleven days to go before the election.' And as if anticipating special entitlement for his candidate, Dworkin continued that 'Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President Elect Hillary Clinton.'
Immediately after the July announcement when Clinton drew the Home Free card, Comey was the object of much Democratic adulation and praise for his exemplary record and trustworthiness. However, over the weekend, the Clinton campaign launched a ferocious attack giving its media benefactors and Democratic bigwigs the green light to dump on Comey with an arsenal of steamrollers. In keeping with the Democratic strategy of irrational verbal assaults, Senator Harry Reid (D-Nv) wrote asserting Comey's violation of the Hatch Act which 'bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election' while former DNC Chair Howard Dean declared that 'Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.'
While US law bans foreign government interference in our elections, where is the outrage for Israel's heavy hand manipulation of American electoral and policy decisions over the last twenty years?
Inexplicably there has been no hint by Democrats that Anthony Weiner may be responsible for providing the FBI with the latest batch of emails, late breaking news is that Weiner, who is looking at a possible fifteen years in the slammer, is 'cooperating' with the FBI and might have traded his wife's emails for a deal.

How did the 'growing trust' that Russian President Vladimir Putin once said marked his 'working and personal relationship with President Obama ' change into today's deep distrust and saber-rattling?
Their relationship reached its zenith after Mr. Putin persuaded Syria to give up its chemical weapons for verified destruction, enabling Mr. Obama at the last minute to call off, with some grace, plans to attack Syria in late summer 2013. But at an international conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, Mr. Putin spoke of the 'feverish' state of international relations and lamented: 'My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results.' He complained about 'people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice' and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a 'common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises.'
A month earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , who chooses his words carefully, told Russian TV viewers, 'My good friend John Kerry '¶ is under fierce criticism from the U.S. military machine. Despite [Mr. Kerry's] assurances that the U.S. commander in chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin) apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief.'
Do not chalk this up to paranoia. The U.S.-led coalition air strikes on known Syrian army positions killing scores of troops just five days into the September cease-fire 'î not to mention statements at the time by the most senior U.S. generals 'î were evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia.
Relations between the U.S. and Russian presidents have now reached a nadir, and Mr. Putin has ordered his own defense ministry to throw down the gauntlet. On Oct. 6, ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia is prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft 'î including any stealth aircraft 'î over Syria, and warned ominously that Russian air defense will not have time to identify the origin of the aircraft.
It seems possible that the U.S. air force will challenge that claim in due course 'î perhaps even without seeking prior permission from the White House. Last week, National Intelligence Director and former Air Force General James Clapper commented offhandedly, 'I wouldn't put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft '¶ if they felt it was threatening their forces on the ground.'
Injecting additional volatility into the equation, major news outlets are playing down or ignoring Russia's warnings. Thus, Americans who depend on the corporate media can be expected to be suitably shocked by what that same media will no doubt cast as naked aggression out of the blue if Russian air defenses down a U.S. or coalition aircraft.
Meanwhile in Europe, as NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters the U.S. is contributing 'a persistent rotational armored brigade combat team' as a 'major sign of the U.S. commitment to strengthening deterrence here.'
'This was a decision made by the alliance leaders in Warsaw,' he explained, referring to NATO's July summit meeting in the Polish capital. 'The United States will lead a battalion in Poland and deploy an entire battle-ready battalion task force of approximately 900 soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany.'
On Thursday, at the Valdai Conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, President Putin accused the West of promoting the 'myth' of a 'Russian military threat,' calling this a 'profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets '¶ expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units, and arms closer to our borders.'
Myth or not, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was correct to point out last spring that military posturing on Russia's borders will bring less regional security. Mr. Steinmeier warned against 'saber-rattling,' adding that, 'We are well advised not to create pretexts to renew an old confrontation.'
Speaking of such pretexts, it is high time to acknowledge that the marked increase in East-West tensions over the past two and a half years originally stemmed from the Western-sponsored coup d'√©tat in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, and Russia's reaction in annexing Crimea. Americans malnourished on the diet served up by 'mainstream' media are blissfully unaware that two weeks before the coup, YouTube published a recording of an intercepted conversation between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the U.S. ambassador in Kiev, during which 'Yats' (for Arseniy Yatsenyuk) was identified as Washington's choice to become the new prime minister of the coup government in Kiev.
This unique set of circumstances prompted George Friedman, president of the think-tank STRATFOR, to label the putsch in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, 'really the most blatant coup in history.'
It's time for Western politicians and media to learn their lesson and pay attention to the statements coming out of Russia. Ask yourselves: Why all this hype now?

ARTICLE

Nation state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state.'
'î Zbigniew Brzezinski, 'Between Two Ages: The Technetronic Era', 1971
'I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria'¶.not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians.'
'î Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Third Presidential Debate
Why is Hillary Clinton so eager to intensify US involvement in Syria when US interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya have all gone so terribly wrong?
The answer to this question is simple. It's because Clinton doesn't think that these interventions went wrong. And neither do any of the other members of the US foreign policy establishment. (aka'ìThe Borg). In fact, in their eyes these wars have been a rousing success. Sure, a few have been critical of the public relations backlash from the nonexistent WMD in Iraq, (or the logistical errors, like disbanding the Iraqi Army) but'ìfor the most part'ì the foreign policy establishment is satisfied with its efforts to destabilize the region and remove leaders that refuse to follow Washington's diktats.
This is hard for ordinary people to understand. They can't grasp why elite powerbrokers would want to transform functioning, stable countries into uninhabitable wastelands overrun by armed extremists, sectarian death squads and foreign-born terrorists. Nor can they understand what has been gained by Washington's 15 year-long rampage across the Middle East and Central Asia that has turned a vast swathe of strategic territory into a terrorist breeding grounds? What is the purpose of all this?
First, we have to acknowledge that the decimation and de facto balkanization of these countries is part of a plan. If it wasn't part of a plan, than the decision-makers would change the policy. But they haven't changed the policy. The policy is the same. The fact that the US is using foreign-born jihadists to pursue regime change in Syria as opposed to US troops in Iraq, is not a fundamental change in the policy. The ultimate goal is still the decimation of the state and the elimination of the existing government. This same rule applies to Libya and Afghanistan both of which have been plunged into chaos by Washington's actions.
But why? What is gained by destroying these countries and generating so much suffering and death?
Here's what I think: I think Washington is involved in a grand project to remake the world in a way that better meets the needs of its elite constituents, the international banks and multinational corporations. Brzezinski not only refers to this in the opening Quote: , he also explains what is taking place: The nation-state is being jettisoned as the foundation upon which the global order rests. Instead, Washington is erasing borders, liquidating states, and removing strong, secular leaders that can mount resistance to its machinations in order to impose an entirely new model on the region, a new world order. The people who run these elite institutions want to create an interconnected-global free trade zone overseen by the proconsuls of Big Capital, in other words, a global Eurozone that precludes the required state institutions (like a centralized treasury, mutual debt, federal transfers) that would allow the borderless entity to function properly.
Deep state powerbrokers who set policy behind the smokescreen of our bought-and-paid-for congress think that one world government is an achievable goal provided they control the world's energy supplies, the world's reserve currency and become the dominant player in this century's most populous and prosperous region, Asia. This is essentially what Hillary's 'pivot' to Asia is all about.
The basic problem with Washington's NWO plan is that a growing number of powerful countries are still attached to the old world order and are now prepared to defend it. This is what's really going on in Syria, the improbable alliance of Russia, Syria, Iran and Hezbollah have stopped the US military juggernaut dead in its tracks. The unstoppable force has hit the immovable object and the immovable object has prevailed'¶so far.
Naturally, the foreign policy establishment is upset about these new developments, and for good reason. The US has run the world for quite a while now, so the rolling back of US policy in Syria is as much a surprise as it is a threat. The Russian Airforce deployed to Syria a full year ago in September, but only recently has Washington shown that it's prepared to respond by increasing its support of its jihadists agents on the ground and by mounting an attack on ISIS in the eastern part of the country, Raqqa. But the real escalation is expected to take place when Hillary Clinton becomes president in 2017. That's when the US will directly engage Russia militarily, assuming that their tit-for-tat encounters will be contained within Syria's borders. It's a risky plan, but it's the next logical step in this bloody fiasco. Neither party wants a nuclear war, but Washington believes that doing nothing is tantamount to backing down, therefore, Hillary and her neocon advisors can be counted on to up the ante. 'No-fly zone', anyone?
The assumption is that eventually, and with enough pressure, Putin will throw in the towel. But this is another miscalculation. Putin is not in Syria because he wants to be nor is he there because he values his friendship with Syrian President Bashar al Assad. That's not it at all. Putin is in Syria because he has no choice. Russia's national security is at stake. If Washington's strategy of deploying terrorists to topple Assad succeeds, then the same ploy will be attempted in Iran and Russia. Putin knows this, just like he knows that the scourge of foreign-backed terrorism can decimate entire regions like Chechnya. He knows that it's better for him to kill these extremists in Aleppo than it will be in Moscow. So he can't back down, that's not an option.
But, by the same token, he can compromise, in other words, his goals and the goals of Assad do not perfectly coincide. For example, he could very well make territorial concessions to the US for the sake of peace that Assad might not support.
But why would he do that? Why wouldn't he continue to fight until every inch of Syria's sovereign territory is recovered?
Because it's not in Russia's national interest to do so, that's why. Putin has never tried to conceal the fact that he's in Syria to protect Russia's national security. That's his main objective. But he's not an idealist, he's a pragmatist who'll do whatever he has to to end the war ASAP. That means compromise.
This doesn't matter to the Washington warlords'¶.yet. But it will eventually. Eventually there will be an accommodation of some sort. No one is going to get everything they want, that much is certain. For example, it's impossible to imagine that Putin would launch a war on Turkey to recover the territory that Turkish troops now occupy in N Syria. In fact, Putin may have already conceded as much to Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan in their recent meetings. But that doesn't mean that Putin doesn't have his red lines. He does. Aleppo is a red line. Turkish troops will not be allowed to enter Aleppo.
The western corridor, the industrial and population centers are all red lines. On these, there will be no compromise. Putin will help Assad remain in power and keep the country largely intact. But will Turkey control sections in the north, and will the US control sections in the east?
Probably. This will have to be worked out in negotiations, but its unlikely that the country's borders will be the same as they were before the war broke out. Putin will undoubtedly settle for a halfloaf provided the fighting ends and security is restored. In any event, he's not going to hang around until the last dog is hung.
Unfortunately, we're a long way from any settlement in Syria, mainly because Washington is nowhere near accepting the fact that its project to rule the world has been derailed. That's the crux of the matter, isn't it? The bigshots who run the country are still in denial. It hasn't sunk in yet that the war is lost and that their nutty jihadist-militia plan has failed.
It's going to take a long time before Washington gets the message that the world is no longer its oyster. The sooner they figure it out, the better it'll be for everyone.

Who will be the winners and the losers in the coming U.S. presidential election? Trump or Clinton, Clinton or Trump? The mainstream media is consumed with personality politics. Who could hold their nerve in a time of crisis? Whose integrity is purer (or less damaged)? If you were forced to choose, who would you trust your house keys with? It's entertainment for the masses. 
There will only be one group of winners: the interlocking oligarchy of financial, oil, military, agribusiness and pharmaceuticals interests than run the U.S. Whether it's Trump or Clinton, policy nuances aside, Washington's empire will stumble on. And it will do so not because of its inherent dynamism but because of its lies, manipulations, militarism and ability to crush any tendencies that exist towards a multi-polar world. 
The U.S. as a nation is bankrupt. It was in dire straits in the 1960s as a result of the Vietnam war and the emergence of economic rivals, such as France and Germany. Shifting off the gold standard and moving towards petrodollar recycling and treasury bond imperialism allowed the empire to remain on course and the dollar to remain as the world's reserve currency. Oil, not gold, became the mainstay of the empire. As long as the (oil-backed) dollar remains the global currency, the U.S. can continue to secure a free lunch courtesy of the rest of the world. 
Today, more than 60 per cent of all foreign currency reserves in the world are in U.S. dollars, and the U.S. will attempt to prevent countries moving off the dollar by any means possible, not least military. 
Washington's economic infrastructure is too weak to mount an economic recovery of note and U.S. corporate cartels will do anything to prevent policies that eat into their profits. They serve their own interests, not any notional 'national interest', and offshoring large parts of the US economy has served them well. 
Indeed, Paul Craig Roberts, former Assistant Secretary to the U.S. Treasury, notes that much of the most productive part of the economy has been moved offshore to increase corporate profits. By doing so, the U.S. has lost critical supply chains, industrial infrastructure and the knowledge of skilled workers. The U.S. could bring its corporations back home by taxing their profits abroad and could also resort to protective tariffs, but such moves would be contrary to the material interests of the ruling oligarchy of private interests, which hold sway over U.S. politics. 
Void of a suitable industrial manufacturing base or the will to invest in productive infrastructure, the U.S. continues with its speculative finance-related bubbles, its non-productive rentier economy and its predatory hold over the institutions of global capitalism (WTO, IMF, World Bank), while its drags its European vassal states into imperialist wars to help maintain global hegemony and ensure allegiance to the U.S. dollar. And this is exactly what we are seeing today as the strategy for global supremacy is played out. 
Over the past two decades, the U.S. has extended its influence throughout Eastern Europe and, among other places, in the Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, Syria and Pakistan (with Washington's presence in neighbouring Afghanistan to all intents and purposes being a proxy war against Pakistan and Chinese influence there). With each passing year and each new conflict, the US has been drawing closer to direct confrontation with Russia and China. 
Russia is holding firm over Syria, which is vital to wider U.S. geopolitical goals that involve the weakening of the Russian energy-dependent economy and ousting Russia from its only naval base outside of the former USSR. A global US strategy is already in force to undermine China's growth and influence, part of which was the main reason for setting up AFRICOM: US Africa Command with responsibility for military operations and relations across Africa. But China is not without influence, and its actions are serving to weaken the hegemony of the U.S. dollar, thereby striking at a key nerve of U.S. power. 
China has been implementing bilateral trade agreements with a number of countries, whereby trade is no longer conducted in dollars but in local currencies. Over the past few years, China and other powers such as Russia have been making agreements to move away from the U.S. dollar in international trade. The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) also plan to start using their own currencies when trading with each other. Russia and China have been using their own national currencies when trading with each other for more two years. 
A report from Africa's largest bank, Standard Bank, stated a few years back: 
'We expect at least $100 billion in Sino-African trade 'ì more than the total bilateral trade between China and Africa in 2010 'ì to be settled in the renminbi by 2015.' 
Under Saddam, Iraq was not using the dollar as the base currency for oil transactions, neither is Iran. Libya's Muammar Gadhaffi was talking about using a gold-backed dinar as the reserve currency for parts of Africa. U.S.-backed destabilisation and war followed. In 2000, Iraq converted all its oil transactions to euros. When U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, it returned oil sales from the euro to the dollar. Little surprise then that we have over the years seen on on-going saga by the U.S. to remove the Iranian regime via sanctions, destabilization, intimidation or the threat of all-out war. 
Iran has looked east to China, Pakistan and central Asia to counteract the effects of U.S. sanctions and develop its economy and boost trade. To sustain its empire, the US has effectively pushed the world into different camps and a new cold war: one not based on competing/alternative political or economic systems but a simmering conflict based on competing capitalist elites or ruling oligarchies who require control over their regional spheres of influence. 
Imperialism still reigns and neither side 'ì whether the U.S., Russia or China 'ì is particularly appealing, not least to those who believe that democratic (green) socialism is the best hope for humanity. In the absence of such a solution, a world not hurtling towards nuclear conflict would serve us well for the time being. 
The U.S. economy appears to be in terminal decline. The only way to prop it up is by corrupt, secretive, lop-sided trade agreements or by waging war to plunder resources and to ensure the print-as-you-go dollar remains the world reserve currency. An empire in decline armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons and trapped in a cycle of endless war to stave off ruin is a frightening scenario. Even more alarming is the talk of pre-emptive nuclear strikes against other nuclear powers such as Russia and China. 
This is the reality that faces the world. This is the reality that the corporate media will not inform the U.S. electorate about. The empire demands a sufficiently ignorant, misinformed public courtesy of a Fox News/CNN made-for-TV election stupor. An electorate that is sufficiently convinced to believe that millionaire-billionaire politicians who climb into bed with Wall Street banks and the rest of the ruling oligarchy have their interests at heart. 
A public for whom the term 'class consciousness' or 'class interest' figures little if anywhere in their political lexicon. The class that appears to be highly conscious of its interests is the one in control: the one that does its level best in ensuring that any such consciousness emerging within the ruled over is shut down at birth 'ì or suffocated within the mind-manipulating control mechanism that is the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. 
They sold your jobs to the lowest bidder abroad under the lie of 'efficiency' to make every greater profit, and they get you to blame your plight on immigrants. They use your taxes to kill and destroy countries under the lie of 'humanitarianism/fighting terror' to secure ever more mineral riches, and they get you to fear the latest bogeyman. And they sell you a vision of democracy that much of the rest of the world regards as shambolic. America, it's time to wake up.

Webster: frequenting the bottom. When a right-wing cell (FBI), from its inception, at the heart of government, now appears to the Left of the leading candidate for president (Clinton), one knows that she is fishing on the shoreline of fascism. From a democratic standpoint, it doesn't get any worse. Even her challenger, matching her stride for stride in vulgarian (pretentious, indecent), gut-authoritarianism, the two the Janus-faced expression of the Class-State, at least does not demonize Putin and Russia, as preparatory, in her case, to still wider confrontation, including China, as dangerously leading up to a catastrophic war, or at first the breakdown of the international order. 
The FBI, from cops and robbers, to reds and fellow subversives, as television and popular opinion would have it, was a spearhead for McCarthyism and a practical annex of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Those were the days, from Baby-face Nelson to the Rosenbergs, and now, hardly chastened from its turbid (muddy, foul, opaque) past, still the guardian of American innocence, Director Comey makes one correct move to undo the legacy of J. Edgar Hoover, and the American political world falls apart. I am not a fan of Comey's for his initial exoneration of Clinton in her use of a private server at State, but surely, this is an eye-opener, about how far the political spectrum has shifted to the Far Right. 
Whomever wins the election, America digs itself deeper into the cesspool of hierarchical class-differentiation, wealth-concentration, a pervasive ideological atmosphere of solipsistic hatred at home for human difference, rancid hegemony abroad for any who seek an alternative path to modernization away from the example of US petrifying capitalism. This election reveals that America, like a broken record, is stuck, playing over and over again the themes of domestic repression and foreign counterrevolution, the ideal synthesis for the unilateral assertion of world power. Neither candidate nor major party distances itself from the latter goal. 
Comey, perhaps against his will and ideological proclivities, achieves standing here, merely, as he should, by doing his duty. The bipartisan consensus maneuvering in place to chastise him reveals the dark reality of a nation so devoted to denial and untruth, possibly to cover over its sins of commission (war crimes, indigenous racism and xenophobia) and omission (failure to act on environmental degradation, an adequate system of health care, a military budget crowding out the general welfare), that it has lost its way and falsified its original promised constitutional existence. America is presently normless, and has been since capitalism inaugurated its take-off stage following the Civil War. And before that, with institutionalized slavery, internal genocidal expansion, and cap-in-hand deference to political ideologues not adverse to compromise with, if not actually representing, vested interests. 
Scratch America from the democratic column, transposed now to an enlarged banana republic wherein one can expect, from either party and successful candidate, enhanced features of an already ripening Police State. Surveillance, proscription, total exclusion of viable methods, measures, and structural changes pointed toward democratization, America will formally become what it already is: a panicked response to the self-realization of its nihilistic core of moral values and systemic attributes'îa nuclear-armed Goliath lacking soul and conscience, and for that reason a menace to world peace and self-renewal at home. No, Comey, by his actions, is not the enemy, but one who for the first time has put on his spectacles and looked around him. There are some things that even an ardent 'patriot' cannot stomach. 
I recall how in the 1960s, e.g., Mississippi Freedom Summer, the FBI would interrogate us, try to sow doubts in the hearts of the demonstrators, act as intimidators pure and simple, combined with its undercover role in breaking up antiwar protests throughout the decade, so I hardly have much hope that things have changed. Yet, my hat is off to Comey, even if only to anger Clinton, force Democrats into self-protective mode, and raise questions about the rotten stinking fish used to fertilize her and the party's position on war and peace, capitalism (Wall Street's Miss America), and the Clintons' own mind-boggling accumulation of personal wealth'îall of which is instinctively known by the public, but unable to extricate from the mental prison of submerged guilt for totalitarian ways and practices. 
We await the election, a studied exercise in un-freedom, where tyranny of false consciousness defines the psychological mental set of America, what Adorno writing sixty-six years ago called authoritarian submission, a framework where the Leadership Principle comes to the foreground if it has not already. Parallels to the incipient stages of Nazism are not an exaggeration, and it is not a loud-mouthed Trump who is necessarily the greatest danger. He is predominantly all-surface. It is Clinton who plumbs the depths of arrogance, ambition, congealed militarism. America, R.I.P. 
My New York Times Comment to its editorial, 'James Comey's Big Mistake,' 11-1-16, follows: 
Comey acted honorably. Unlike Hoover, he is here depoliticizing the FBI. The Times has demonstrated such partiality to Clinton, in news selection as well as editorial opinion, that it is hard to take its criticism seriously. Endorsement is one thing, blind-siding the other side quite different. Are not emails a legitimate area of investigation? Does not the public have the right to know, especially in an election? If there is no smoking gun, this will redound to Clinton's benefit; if there is, yes, it might change minds. But what is wrong with that? 
Clinton invariably is treated with kid gloves. Even the initial issue, the use of a private server to transact government business, is forgotten. Rather than jump on Comey, why not revisit the whole question'ìwhich Comey had originally dismissed'ìof Clinton's valuing of transparency, and from there (although it is now late in the game) her whole foreign policy framework and hostility, in particular, to Putin and Russia? 
To criticize Clinton does not necessarily make one an apologist for Trump. Call the shots with equal endeavor; responsible journalism requires no less.

The Greatest Name shall do its things, O heart, be of good cheer For by wile and guile the demon shall never become Solomon. 
~ Hafiz 
In 2014, a former, estranged disciple of Seyyed Hossein Nasr's 'î an ex-Maryamiyyah member 'î told me that Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Russian fascist Alexander Dugin and his organization are on quite intimate terms, apparently sharing similar long-term political aspirations, and not just where their purported Traditionalism is concerned. At the time this revelation struck me as a bit odd since Nasr (and specifically his son Vali-Reza) are staunch Atlanticists 'ì- Vali-Reza Nasr being the veritable prized subaltern ornament of Neoconservatism in America 'î whereas Dugin and his Eurasianism ostensibly (at least where the rhetoric is concerned) stand at the very opposite pole. The complex details of this Nasr-Dugin nexus is a discussion better left for another day, only to say that 'ì- and as recently outlined in one academic monograph [1] 'î this unlikely fellowship may actually have something to do with Frithjof Schuon's (d. 1998) underlying ideological 'Aryanism' with its 'de-semitization' of the theosophical Sufism of Ibn 'Arabi: an 'Aryanism' and 'de-semitization' that Dugin's brand of occult fascism would very much be in agreement with. But let us turn here to the checkered history of the Maryamiyyah Sufi Order itself, which Seyyed Hossein Nasr currently heads [2]. 
The Maryamiyyah Sufi Order 
The Maryamiyyah is the Sufi order created by the Swiss writer and esotericist Frithjof Schuon (d. 1998) which stems from an Algerian sub-branch of the Shadhiliyah Sufi Order [3]. After briefly visiting North Africa in the early 1930s to meet the charismatic Shaykh Ahmad al-Alawi (d. 1934) [4], from the mid 1930s onward Schuon attracted disciples of his own in his native Switzerland while as of 1936 he also began claiming to be the successor to this same Shaykh Ahmad al-Alawi. The actual successors of Shaykh Ahmad al-Alawi, however, have adamantly denied Schuon's claims and instead maintain that Schuon only spent a sum total of a few days with their master in the early 1930s; that he was barely even initiated into their order, only authorized to transmit the Muslim confession of belief (i.e. the shahada ); let alone being the Shaykh Ahmad al-Alawi's actual successor. This, and other related controversies, soon led to a bitter schism within the ranks of the Traditionalist school and specifically a personal falling out between Frithjof Schuon and the leading intellectual light of the movement, the Frenchman Rene Gu√©non (d. 1951). One recent study published in Iran suggests that Gu√©non's premature death in Cairo in 1951 may have even been somehow orchestrated by the Maryamiyyah itself, thus making of Gu√©non's demise possibly a murder at their hands since, had he lived longer, Gu√©non's rivalry with Schuon would have certainly proven deleterious to Schuon and the Maryamiyyah's long-term political interests [5]. 
Particularly after Rene Gu√©non's death, Frithjof Schuon's Maryamiyyah Sufi Order (based at the time in Basle, Switzerland and now operating almost like a quasi-Masonic order) began spreading among some elite Western intellectual circles, claiming in its ranks some notable figures among the academic Islamic Studies as well as the Comparative Religious Studies establishments of the time (eg. Huston Smith, Victor Danner, Cyril Glasse, to name few). During the 1960s Schuon now claimed mystical visions of the 'Divine Feminine' in the naked form of the Virgin Mary who anointed him the Avatar of the Age, the Imam Mahdi, the Return of Christ, the Fifth Buddha, the incarnations of Kalki and Vishnu, etc. Within its specific Islamicate context, Schuon's claims, his 'universalist' teachings, and some of the details of his visions of the divine feminine are eerily similar to those claimed by the Baha'i founder Mirza Husayn 'Ali Nuri Baha'u'llah (d. 1892), with other striking similarities existing between Bahaism and the Maryamiyyah that deserves a detailed comparative analysis in its own right. Today both also enjoy a very cozy relationship with the state of Israel 'î with the former also sharing a cozy relationship with the Gulf potentates as well as the Moroccan elite. 
One feature of the Maryamiyyah practice which they are noted for is that they pray to Schuon as well as the Virgin Mary; and, along with offering blessings ( salawat ) to the Prophet Muhammad and the Madonna, the order also offers daily blessings ( salawat ) to Frithjof Schuon 'ì- a feature of their practice which would certainly scandalize any orthodox Muslim, Sunni or Shi'i. Much of the Maryamiyyah's teachings and practices also seem to share common elements with the Indian Tantric Left-Hand Path tradition. Schuon's 'sacred nudity' and his spin on the nature of the 'divine feminine' would be easily recognizable to any genuine Tantric initiate. Be that as it may, and even under the mountains of obfuscatory terminological mumbo-jumbo that the Maryamiyyah regularly use to conceal the fact, the Left-Hand Path is never mentioned nor is it remotely the 'orthodoxy' that Schuon insists upon in his books; but rather it is the very same 'heterodoxy' he incessantly decries. To date, the Maryamiyyah have never forthrightly acknowledged this fact or dealt with it in any honest manner. 
That said, in 1980 Schuon, his family, entourage and disciples moved from Switzerland to Bloomington, Indiana, and henceforth made it the Maryamiyyah's headquarters. A series of scandals and public defections rocked the cult throughout the 1980s, and in the early 1990s Schuon was even briefly indicted by an Indiana Grand Jury. These scandals stemmed from Schuon's 'Primordial Gatherings' in Bloomington were scantily clad members of the Maryamiyyah 'ì- with Schuon sometimes appearing completely naked donning only a Native American Lakota head-dress 'î would publicly engage in activities resembling something between a Native American pow-wow, a Sufi majlis and a Tantric maithuna ceremony. However, the scandals were very swiftly covered up and the public prosecutors and attorneys involved against the Maryamiyyah were eventually intimidated and browbeaten by unknown, behind the scenes actors to drop the case against Schuon: a case, I might add, involving allegations by ex-members of criminal sexual impropriety in the presence of minors (including paedophilia and related felonies). Schuon was also accused of forcing some of his leading disciples to divorce their wives, which he would then promptly re-marry as his 'vertical' or 'spiritual' wives [6]. 
Schuon died in 1998 and left a splintered, scandal-ridden organization in his wake with one group gravitating towards the figure of Martin Lings (d. 2005) in the UK 'î who had served as Gu√©non's secretary in Cairo while also being among Schuon's earliest disciples 'î with another group congregating around the figure of Seyyed Hossein Nasr in the Beltway area of the United States. More diehard Schuonites stayed in Bloomington, Indiana, and refused to recognize either Lings or Nasr as Schuon's putative successors and continued with their syncretistic, nudist 'Primordial Gatherings' as before. 
The Maryamiyyah After Schuon and Its Marriage to Empire 
Both Nasr and Lings brought the Maryamiyyah closer to the circles of Western elites. To some degree this was already a process in full swing during Schuon's own lifetime. But Nasr and Lings each in turn made closer alliances with the British establishment and the American deep state, going so far on occasion to operate in the capacity of covert and clandestine fronts for Anglo-American 'soft power' in numerous locales throughout the Muslim world [7]. Seyyed Hossein Nasr himself was already a royalist insider in Pahlavi Iran, especially during the last two decades and a half of the Pahlavi regime, earning his post at Aryamehr (now Shahid Beheshti) University due to his intimate connections with the Shah's royal court and Farah Pahlavi specifically. It was as a consequence of this royalist connection that he was forced to flee Iran in 1979 following the Islamic Revolution. 
That said, while not formally accounting himself among the ranks of the Maryamiyyah, Prince Charles, for example, considers himself to be some kind of (soft) Traditionalist as well as an avid fan of the writings of Gu√©non, A.K. Coomaraswamy, Schuon, Nasr and other Traditionalists. It should also be pointed out that the presence of Schuonian Traditionalists among assorted reactionary monarchist groups and organizations is a regular feature of their activities virtually everywhere around the world. This would also explain their proximity to the Moroccan royalty and elite. What is not widely appreciated is their alleged closeness to the various potentates and elites in the Gulf kingdoms (who are not usually known for their love of Sufism), and particularly those in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Due to his skills and vast connections, some ex-Maryamiyyah members even contend that Martin Lings himself may have been a life-long operative of the British SIS/MI6 [8]. Then there is Seyyed Hossein Nar's long-time association and friendship with Henry Kissinger; the fact that prominent Turkish Maryamiyyah member Ibrahim Kalin has served as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's official spokesman in Turkey for some years now; not to mention the proximity of the Maryamiyyah to the Jordanian royal family and Prince Ghazi specifically who publishes 'The Muslim 500' which regularly lauds the policies of the corrupt Gulf kingdoms and celebrates Anglo-American and Israeli policy against Iran and Syria [9]. Certainly the Russian occult fascist Alexander Dugin knows all about these linkages yet continues in his association with Nasr and the Maryamiyyah, which defies conventional explanation when he, his organization and the Russian state that Dugin advises pretend to stand as geopolitical adversaries to everything Nasr, his Maryamiyyah Sufi Order and these Atlanticist connections represent. 
On the ground in North America, the Maryamiyyah's rank-and-file is predominantly composed of upper middle-class professionals (monied and college educated) with white upper middle-class converts being the most preferred among recruits. Liberal, left-leaning and anti-establishment members entering the order are often required to become apolitical and focus instead on the 'inner life' and forgo all politics, but over time they are turned conservative (or, rather, reactionary) and instead made to support the establishment conservatism of the Republican Party. One former member has alleged that Seyyed Hossein Nasr was actively canvassing for George W. Bush among his acolytes during both the elections of 2000 and 2004 and for John McCain in 2008, proving that father and son share identical political views and that the proverbial apple does not fall far from the tree. Be that as it may, so much for the 'Traditionalism' that ostensibly seeks to shun the convoluted and corrupt materialist politics of the 'Reign of Quantity', especially the politics of the West which Traditionalists are supposed to believe represents the epitome of this 'Reign of Quantity' 'ì or, as they elsewhere like calling it, 'the system of the Antichrist.' The same contact also reported rampant classism, racism and similar discriminatory, elitist attitudes prevalent throughout the Maryamiyyah Sufi Order together with an almost 'congenital hatred' for all forms of liberal/leftwing and social justice causes, issues and charities [10]. To deflect and smokescreen from his own role in the Pahlavi regime, Seyyed Hossein Nasr has even gone on public record recently besmirching the memory of Ali Shariati (d. 1977) and accusing him of having been a SAVAK mole [11]; this, while some former members have alleged that the FBI, DHS, NSA, CIA and other agencies of American law enforcement and the US deep state are crawling all over the Maryamiyyah Sufi Order as either full-fledged members, affiliates or sympathizers [12]. 
As a process that began under Schuon, the Maryamiyyah has also firmly entrenched itself within important segments of the Islamic/Mid East Studies establishment of the Western Ivory Tower as well as in parts of the Muslim world, strategically placing proverbial 'gatekeepers' in key places. Besides Seyyed Hossein Nasr himself, William Chittick, Terry Moore, Hasan Awan, Reza-Shah Kazemi and Alan Godlas are presently just a few of those names associated with the Maryamiyyah at its highest level [13]. The Iranian scholar Gholamreza Avani, who was also at one time a student of Henry Corbin's 'î who, for his part, was either generally aloof, if not hostile, to the views of Gu√©non, Schuon and the Traditionalists 'î is the most eminent figure of the Maryamiyyah Sufi Order in Iran today. 
In recent times, allegations of abuse and cult-like behaviour continue to bedevil the Maryamiyyah's reputation. A noteworthy incident is the one cited by Koslow (and reiterated by Shahbazi in his book) regarding the initial publication schedule for Mark Sedgwick's ' Against the Modern World ' [14]. Apparently the book was supposed to have been published by Oxford University Press earlier than 2004. Koslow claims that Sedgwick wrote to him in 2004 to say that Oxford University Press had been ''¶threatened by the Schuon cult with legal harassment [regarding its initial publication draft]. Rather than face the mafioso tactics thrown at him by the Schuon cult, Sedgwick'¶backed down and published a rather weak assessment of Schuon's polygamous activities, criminal actions, visions of nude Virgins and delusions of grandeur'¶' [15] 
Withal, it should be underscored that Sufism has not always been (nor is it in all present circumstances) in the service of First World imperial, neo-colonial agendas. Historically many individual Sufis and Sufi orders have actually stood against Western imperialism, colonialism and their lackeys. Amir Abd al-Qadir Jaza'iri (d. 1883) in Algeria, Shamil Daghestani (d. 1859) in the Caucuses, Umar Mukhtar (d. 1931) in Libya and those Iranian Sufi masters with their disciples who stood on the side of the people during the period of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution (1905-09) and later with the Islamic Revolution of 1979 are just some prominent examples of Sufis who have stood against both authoritarianism as well as the colonial powers of their day. 
Unfortunately Western (and specifically Anglo-American) Sufism has increasingly gone in another direction, allying itself more and more with the agendas of Western establishments and the core interests of Empire in the Muslim world (the Naqshbandi-Haqqani Sufi Order is another notable example here). This turn to the darkside by organized Sufism in the West may also explain one of the heretofore unnoted factors in the growth of Islamist ideologies and organizations among countless disaffected, marginalized (immigrant) Sunni Muslim communities, since such a blatant infiltration of Sufism by the Western establishment, with the inevitable corruption it brings with it, is unquestionably as big a betrayal of the 'Tradition' as Islamism itself is. It certainly also explains why a country like the Islamic Republic of Iran is generally weary of the influence and activities of such organizations as the Maryamiyyah Sufi Order and similar.

In Drowning in a Sea of Microwaves , the late geneticist Dr Mae-Wan Ho 'ì a visionary voice who opposed GMOs 'ì identified pollution from wireless technologies as a pressing issue of our times. 
Noting evidence for 'DNA damage '¶ cancers, microwave sickness, [and], impairment of fertility', she concluded: 'Evidence is emerging that the health hazards associated with wireless microwaves are at least comparable to, if not worse than, those associated with cigarette smoking.' 
Since the advent of radar, followed by mobile phones and dense WiFi networks, such anthropogenic radiation has sky-rocketed. Although it is non-ionising, and does not destabilise molecules directly, evidence of other harm has been growing since 1950s studies on radar workers. 
According to the updated Bio-initiative Report (2012+) by 29 precautionary scientists, effects on biology feature in several thousand, peer-reviewed papers. Yet troubling new findings rarely filter into the media. Or global Green discourse. 
Though many studies have reported 'no significant effect', research by University of Washington biology professor Henry Lai, and others, reveals that wireless-industry funding is far more likely to yield such findings. 
'Toujours ils cr√©ent doubte' ('they are forever creating doubt'), explains former Luxembourg Green MP Jean Huss, whose research on the wireless industry inspired the Council of Europe to call for many precautions (2011), including protection of warning scientists, and wired internet in schools. 
But wireless-product marketing has a loud voice. Few of us realise that genetic effects and free radical damage 'ì both disease risks over time 'ì are the most common, cautionary findings. Device-crowded spaces, such as our peak commuter trains or all-wireless classrooms, may be creating a subtly toxic environment. 
Wide-ranging, oxidative harm to animals has been found from WiFi sources. And linked pre-diabetic and pre-cancerous changes. Ground-breaking work by biochemistry professor Martin Pall , Washington State University 'ì winner of eight international awards 'ì reveals a viable mechanism for such harm. But as with other 'inconvenient truths', it is going unheard. 
Bee-whispers: the sensitivity of life on Earth 
Life's exquisite electro-physiology is still being discovered. Researchers at Bristol University reported in May that bees' hairs are highly sensitive to flowers' delicate EMFs. In controlled trials in Switzerland, bees reacted to mobile-phone signals with high-pitched 'piping': a cue to desert a hive. 
Other studies show that mitochondria , the tiny power houses in our cells, are at risk from our new EMFs. And that even DNA , in its delicate antenna-like structure, may be frequency-sensitive. 
The long-term, ecological implications of our new, anthropogenic radiation are not known. But peer-reviewed studies revealing harm to birds , tadpoles , trees , other plants , insects, rodents and livestock , offer clues. 
Biology professor Lukas Margaritis, at Athens University, for example, uncovered harm to fruit flies from just a few minutes' exposure to our everyday wireless devices, including cordless phones, Bluetooth, and even digital baby monitors. Reviewing research, India's Ministry of Environment and Forests warned that sensitive habitats may need some protection. 
The UK's Digital Economy Bill , about to receive its final seal, has sensible proposals for increasing country-wide access to fibre broadband: a technology that does not, in itself, stoke microwave pollution, though wireless add-ons do so. But probe beyond the bill to Ofcom's 5G consultations, and new EMF exposures emerge: part of global trend. 
The worldwide rush towards 5G or 'fifth generation' wireless rollouts is set to raise our pulsing pollution to new levels. Untested, high microwave frequencies are being lined up to increase bandwidth, automation, and usage 'ì at great profit to the industry. 
These millimetre and centimetre waves, though too weak to heat us, may pose possible risks to our skin, and deeper surface tissue, including that of plants. High-density transmitters are envisaged. A troubling prospect for the many hundreds of patients seen by professor Dominique Belpomme 's clinic in Paris: patients whose disabling symptoms from wireless technologies are supported by new brain scans and blood tests . 
A delegation of scientists have petitioned for such electrosensitivity to be recognised as an environmentally-induced illness , with an International Disease Code (2015). 
Rip-tides: when profits outpace caution 
Pushing for fast rollouts, the wireless industry is also in conflict with the Internatonal EMF Scientists' Appeal to the United Nations. Signed by 223 scientists from 41 nations, it calls for remedial action 'ì such as new safety limits, wave-free zones, and education of doctors 'ì to protect our DNA, fertility, and nervous systems, plus children and pregnant women, from growing wireless exposure. And from rising, mains-electricity fields. 
Signs that such caution may be needed are growing. The pulsed, polarized , microwaves used by wireless technologies pose more biological risks than smooth or natural waves. Weak millimetre waves have a known potential to increase antibiotic resistance : what ecological effects might they risk, perhaps, if used universally? 
Studies also reveal a risk to skin pain receptors . Published associations between radio 'ì masts and skin cancers, though at lower frequencies, plus mobile-phone masts and EMF-sensitive cancers (Adilza Dode, Minas Gerais University 2013), raise further questions. 
In his summer press conference, Tom Wheeler 'ì former head of the CTIA, the vast telecoms lobby- group, and controversial chair of the Federal Communications Commission 'ì proposed unbridled 'massive deployment' of commercial 5G transmitters, taking off in 2020. 
Anticipating 'tens of billions of dollars' of economic growth, with US telecoms 'first out of the gate', he warned 'Stay out of the way of technological development! Turning innovation loose is far preferable to expecting '¶ regulators to define the future'. 
With no mention of health-testing, carbon costs, or corporate responsibility, the FCC voted unaminously to go ahead by releasing swathes of untested high frequencies for private sector exploitation 'ì so setting a trend. To questionable ends: added to other issues, how will our communities be affected by addiction to 5G multi-stream videos? How will it impact our spiritual communion with Nature? 
Many American health activists, and cautioning scientists, are aghast. Dr Joel Moskowitz, director of community health studies at the University of California, warns 'precaution is warranted before 5G is unleashed on the world'. 
Former government physicist Dr Ron Powell points out the plans 'would irradiate everyone, including the most vulnerable to harm from radiofrequency radiation: pregnant women, unborn children, young children'¶the elderly, the disabled, and the chronically ill'¶ It would set a goal of irradiating all environments'. 
Fracking the air? Fault-lines in safety 
This drive to mine the electromagnetic spectrum come-what-may has echoes of fracking, and other headlong trends. In Captured Agency , the Harvard ethics report on the FCC, and the wider wireless industry, Norm Alster exposes ruthless 'hardball tactics', supported by 'armies of lawyers', at expense to our health. 
Microwaves, Science and Lies (2014), filmed by Jean H√™ches across Europe, exposes similar patterns that are driving our pulsed radiation to risky levels. Western 'safety limits', based only on high levels that heat tissue, far exceed those of Russia , China, and some other nations. 
Professor Yuri Grigoriev , long-serving chair of Russia's non-ionising radiation protection body (RNCNIRP), warned the UK's Radiation Research Trust 'ionising radiation is monitored'¶[but] levels of non-ionising radiation are constantly increasing and ubiquitous: it is out of control '¶ Urgent action is needed'. 
Stealthy pollution-raisers, such as the 5G Internet of Things 'ì with 30 billion tiny transmitters forecast for 2020 'ì and also, sadly, wireless smart-meters [ 1 , 2 *], vetoed by the American Academy of Environmental Medicine , may run counter to a cherished Green goal: that of nurturing healthy environments. 
Can we manage our energy, perhaps, in more bio-sensitive ways? Court claims for wireless-meter health harm, supported by medical testimonies 'ì including by neurology professor Andrew Marino (Louisiana) 'ì are sweeping America. Professor Pall explains such meters' 'high intensity' microwave pulses may be more toxic than we realise: 'We know from the nanosecond studies these can be very damaging'. 
Data obtained by a judge revealed all-hour, house-piercing pulses every few seconds. New data-over-wiring innovations (if free of 'dirty electricity') may offer inspiring, alternative ways forward. 
Chrysalis: a paradigm in waiting 
To create 'ì in Wheeler's phrase 'ì a global '5G ecosystem' of wireless super-saturated environments, at insidious risk, over time, to living ecosystems, not least our own bodies, is dysfunctional. And spiritually disturbing. It suggests a mindset deeply at odds with the orchid-like beauty of the Earth. 
But cleaner innovations, such as LiFi , 'eco-dect-plus' phones, and the latest fibre-optics, suggest a wiser course. A new paradigm 'ì safer connectivity, plus more balanced use 'ì is emerging. And reminds of other step-changes in awareness. From pesticides to organic, from smoke-filled to smoke-free. 
We can accede, if we wish, to our rising, planetary smog. To safety limits as high as the moon, in many scientists' eyes. And to wireless rollouts' growing carbon costs. Or taking pause, we may begin to call the industry to account 'ì plus governments lulled by it. 
We may air helpful new findings, such as risks from tablet-like exposures ( Alexander Lerchl , Jacob Bremens University, 2015). And stark risks from passive exposure, bared by Leif Salford , medical professor at Lund University. We may defend DNA, if we wish, from ionizing and published non-ionizing risks , just as we defend our planet. 
And alongside French Green Party MPs Laurence Abeille and Mich√®le Rivasi , plus the interntional Baubiologie movement, we can explore electromagnetic hygiene. Uplifting possibilities for a safer, cleaner world. 
Lynne Wycherley is a nature poet with six published collections. Working in parallel with pioneering doctors, she has been investigating non-ionising radiation for 5 years.

Aren't you surprised that Hillary and the presstitutes haven't blamed Putin for FBI director Comey's reopening of the Hillary email case? But the presstitutes have done the next best thing for Hillary. They have made Comey the issue, not Hillary. 
According to US Senator Harry Reid and the presstitutes, we don't need to worry about Hillary's crimes. After all, she is only a political woman feathering her nest, just as political men have done for ages. Why all this misogynist talk about Hillary? The presstitutes' cry is that Comey's alleged crime is far more important. This woman-hating Republican violated the Hatch Act by telling Congress that the investigation he said was closed is now reopened. A very strange interpretation of the Hatch Act. During an election it is OK to announce that a candidate for president is cleared but it is not OK to say that a candidate is under investigation. 
In July 2016 Comey violated the Hatch Act when he, on orders from the corrupt Obama Attorney General, announced Hillary clean. In so doing, Comey used the prestige of federal clearance of Hillary's violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls. 
Actually, Hillary's standing in the polls is based on the pollsters over-weighting Hillary supporters in the polls. It is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions. If you look at the crowds attending the two candidate's public appearances, it is clear that the American people prefer Donald Trump, who is opposed to war with Russia and China. War with nuclear powers is the big issue of the election. 
Hillary's problem has the ruling American Oligarcy, for which Hillary is the total servant, concerned. What are they going to do about Trump if he wins? Will his fate be the same as John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, George Wallace? Time will tell. Or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the Oligarchy got rid of Dominique Strauss-Kahn? 
All of the American and Western feminists, progressives, and left-wing remnant fell for the obvious frame-up of Strauss-Kahn. After Strauss-Kahn was blocked from the Presidency of France and resigned as Director of the IMF, the New York authorities had to drop all charges against Strauss-Kahn. But Washington had succeeded in putting its French vassal, Sarkozy, in the presidency of France. 
This is how the American Oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests. The corrupt self-serving Oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media, the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities, and, of course, through the presstitutes, Americans' minds. 
The Oligarchs are now hard-pressed to rescue Hillary as US president, so let's see if the Oligarchs can once again deceive the American people. 
While we wait, let's concern ourselves with another important issue. The Clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the 20th century allowed a small handful of mega-corporations to consolidate the US media in a few hands. This vast increase in the power of the Oligarchy was accomplished despite US anti-trust law. The media mergers destroyed the American tradition of a dispersed and independent media. 
But really, what does federal law mean to the One Percent. Nothing whatsoever. The One Percent's power makes them immune to law. Hillary's crimes might cost her the election, but she won't go to jail. 
Not content with 90% control of the US media, the Oligarchy wants more concentration and more control. Looks like they will be getting it, thanks to the corrupt US government. The Federal Trade Commission is supposed to enforce US anti-trust law. Instead, the federal agency routinely violates US anti-trust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests. 
Because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law, we now have 'banks too big to fail,' unregulated Internet monopoly, and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media. 
Not so long ago there was a field of economics known as anti-trust. Ph.D. candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power. I assume that this field of economics, like the America of my youth, no longer exists. 
Rahul Manchanda explains that 'yet again another huge media conglomerate is being swallowed and acquired by another huge media conglomerate, to create another gargantuan media outlet, in another consolidation of the enormous power, money, wealth, intimidation, conspiracy and control' that eviscerates the US Constitution and the First Amendment.

Dublin, Ireland.
The West is feeling more and more like an irrational maze. The banks are mad. The austerity too. But the anti-Russia hysteria is the final straw. It's not just 'anti-Russia': it's anti-truth, anti-rational and anti-modern. It's the end result of postmodernism. What began as irony is now systematic madness.
Everything is upside down. Or maybe at last it's the right side up. Maybe the West to begin with never was the Free World. Wasn't that the whole point of modernism? Modernism was self criticism. Modernism was critical of the West. And then along came postmodernism. And the West suddenly was off the hook. The West wearing the clothes of postmodernism went on the attack again.
The end result is that anything goes as long as the West wins. Forget the truth. Forget the facts. And forget history. Everything apparently is fiction. The West can say what it wants because everything is interpretation. That's the beauty of postmodernism. You can contradict yourself a million times and laugh it all off. As long as you've the power. And that's the key word: power. Because postmodernism was from the word go a political project. One that was made in the West for the West.
The end result is hatred for Russia. And love for 'Al-Qaeda'. Why? Because Russia attempted to rationalise the world. It attempted to apply reason to the 21st century. And so the irrational West had to punish it. Listen to Putin in 2007 when he spoke in Munich:
'However, what is a unipolar world? However one might embellish this term, at the end of the day it refers to one type of situation, namely one centre of authority, one centre of force, one centre of decision-making.
It is [a] world in which there is one master, one sovereign. And at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system, but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within.
And this certainly has nothing in common with democracy. Because, as you know, democracy is the power of the majority in light of the interests and opinions of the minority.
Incidentally, Russia 'ì we 'ì are constantly being taught about democracy. But for some reason those who teach us do not want to learn themselves.
I consider that the unipolar model is not only unacceptable but also impossible in today's world. And this is not only because if there was individual leadership in today's 'ì and precisely in today's 'ì world, then the military, political and economic resources would not suffice. What is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilisation.'
And listen to him in New York in 2015 when he spoke in the UN General Assembly:
' and so the export of revolutions, this time of so-called democratic ones, continues. It would suffice to look at the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, as has been mentioned by previous speakers. Certainly political and social problems in this region have been piling up for a long time, and people there wish for changes naturally.
But how did it actually turn out? Rather than bringing about reforms, an aggressive foreign interference has resulted in a brazen destruction of national institutions and the lifestyle itself. Instead of the triumph of democracy and progress, we got violence, poverty and social disaster. Nobody cares a bit about human rights, including the right to life.
I cannot help asking those who have caused the situation, do you realize now what you've done?'
Did you hear the plea for reason? Did you hear the cry for modernity? Did you hear the demand for 'moral foundations' 'ì for universal values 'ì for international law? Did you hear the defence of national sovereignty and the defence of the UN Charter? The West didn't. In these two key Russian speeches (Munich '07 and New York '15) the West only heard a threat to it's power.
The West's reply to Russia's rationalism was and continues to be irrationalism. Media madness, 'Presidential' paranoia and Islamic insanity is the West's response to the truth. And the truth is no secret. But the West just shrugs it's shoulders and laughs it all off. The truth is Western imperialism: the unipolar world, full spectrum dominance, neo-con mendacity, hybrid warfare, sanctions, speculation, special forces, the CIA, fundamentalism and American Exceptionalism. In short: Putin hit the nail on the head.
And the West hit back. Why? Because the West can't defend itself rationally. There is no good reason for all the wealth found in the West. So there can only be a bad reason: imperial power. And modernism proved beyond doubt that it was bad. However as this power was rolled back in modern times 'ì as the victims of Empire succeeded in liberating themselves 'ì postmodern times came to the rescue of the West. In Nietzsche the West found it's champion. The will to power was the West's trump card. And with Nietzsche's blessing it played it.
For Nietzsche all that mattered was power. And whoever had it needed no justification or reason. Truth was a lie. And morality was only for the weak. However if this intellectual climate only emerged and became hegemonic in the late 1970s (think of Reagan and Thatcher) it of course was ever present behind the scenes in the dark corners of Western imperialism. For instance: America's leading strategist (and Russian 'expert') after World War Two, George F. Kennan, famously put it into words in Memo PPS23 (1948):
'We have about 50% of the world's wealth but only 6.3% of its population'¶.Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships, which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity. To do so we will have to dispense with all sentimentality'¶.We should cease to talk about vague'¶.unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of living standards, and democratisation. The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.'
Nietzsche could not have said it better himself. The question is though: has this elite Western approach to the world changed since Kennan wrote Memo PPS23? No 'ì it has only become more crass. As a result this Nietzschean worldview is what Russia is up against today. But haven't we seen this before? Hasn't Nietzsche in another guise attacked Russia already? Have not the forces of irrationalism invaded Russia before? And did Russia not for our benefit defeat those forces of irrationalism? We still owe Russia.
So let's support it today it by burying Nietzsche. And by resurrecting universal reason and all the ideals which are built upon it. Give modern secular life another chance. Not just in Syria but in the West too.
