Mike Pence Purges Transition Team of Registered Lobbyists 
Choose the term you like the best: 'Drain the Swamp,”'Clear the Decks,”'Throw the Bums Out,”'Clean House,” or just plain 'Purge.” They are all good descriptors of what Mr. Trump has assured us would happen to the leftists when he arrived in DC. 
It looks like it's more than just Donald Trump who is cleaning house. Mike Pence is now handing out pink slips to transition team members as they get the group ready to do its work of moving Trump into the Oval Office. It's a breath of fresh air in an environment that has been politically and ethically toxic for the past eight years. 
More the purge on page two.
