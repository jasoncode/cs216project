BNI Store Oct 26 2016 Coming soon, to a French neighborhood near you'¦7,000 MORE illegal alien Muslim invaders who set fire to their Calais jungle camp as the camp was being shut down Hey, where are all the women and children? Reuters French authorities said on Wednesday they had finished clearing the 'Jungle', a squalid shantytown outside Calais built by Muslim invaders who had hoped to make the passage to Britain but whose last inhabitants are now mostly dispersed around France. The operation passed off peacefully for the most part, though some migrants torched tents and shelters in a last act of defiance as their hopes of a new life in Britain evaporated. Some reports say that British anarchists set fire to the tents. 'This is the end of the 'Jungle',' Calais regional prefect Fabienne Buccio said. 'Mission accomplished.' Earlier in the day, riot police spread out around the camp, and fire trucks moved in to put out blazes that sent plumes of smoke into the sky. Muslim freeloaders from the Middle East, Asia and Africa congregated to Calais hoping to cross the short stretch of sea to Britain by leaping on trucks and trains, or even walking through the tunnel under the Channel. Britain refused to accept the vast majority of them '“ apart from a number of unaccompanied child migrants (who are actually adults in their 20's and 30's) now being processed separately '“ and high fences were built to keep them away from the port traffic, but still they came. Local opposition to the sprawling slum, along with growing criticism from right-wing politicians, finally stung the French government into action. The British referendum vote this year to quit the European Union was in large part driven by such worries, and stoked by scenes of the Calais migrants trying to force their way in. Hamid, 30, from Afghanistan, said he had been among those setting fire to shelters in the Jungle, and still hoped to cross the Channel to Britain. 'We don't care about problems that are to come after this. We did it because we don't want to stay in France,' he said. 'We want to go to England and England only. It doesn't matter if I go to jail here.'

GERMANY: Syrian Muslim invader shouting 'Allahu Akbar' disrupts church wedding, gropes statue of Virgin Mary A newlywed couple claims their big day was ruined when a Muslim illegal alien burst inside the church shouting 'Allahu Akbar' and then started tearing down wedding decorations, laughing wildly, and fondling a statue of the Virgin Mary. ( Maybe he had a 'sexual emergency?' ) Karmel Church in Duisburg UK Daily Mail (h/t Brenda K) Groom Marcel Lohbeck, 35, and bride Friederike were celebrating their wedding with 90 guests in the Karmel Church in Duisburg, a city in western Germany . Lochbeck said: 'At the beginning of the ceremony, a man with a thick jumper and a hat on came into the church and sat in the back row. 'Shortly afterwards, he stood up and wandered around the candles. He laughed in a disturbing manner and then fondled the statue of Mary. 'He had been speaking in Arabic and partly English. He then started destroying the flowers and kept shouting 'Allahu Akbar'.' Police officer Ludger A., 57, the uncle of the groom, reportedly tried to intervene along with the church sexton. The officer said: 'We tried to calm the Syrian Muslim invader.' After the man again refused to leave the church, there was a fight in which the police officer got slight injuries to his face. Yet he managed to restrain the man until his colleagues from the Duisburg police could arrive. After a medical examination, the 23-year-old Syrian was taken to a psychiatric hospital. Well, at least he didn't destroy the statue and urinate on it as Muslims did HERE :

BNI Store Oct 26 2016 When a Muslim in America runs for political office, the ONLY reason he is running is to spread Islam. Period. FLORIDA: Mass mailing sent to Temple Terrace homes in the Tampa area questions whether or not a Muslim candidate is fit for office and offers solid reasons why he probably is not. CAIR-Florida City Council candidate Wael Odeh has lived more than three decades in this town of 25,000 straddling the Hillsborough River. Odeh is also a Muslim, born in Palestinian territory, and some believes that's enough to disqualify him from election to the City Council. An anonymous letter has been mailed to a number of addresses in Temple Terrace questioning whether City Hall is safe with a Muslim working there and whether Odeh has ties to terrorism. The typewritten, single-spaced, one-page letter is dated October 2016. Among a number of questions it poses: 'Could Odeh's election be a foot in the door of Sharia Law's subtle influence in our community?' Sharia is the detailed system of religious law developed by Muslim scholars in the early centuries of Islam and still in force among fundamentalists. Among other questions raised in the letter are why Odeh has not revealed in campaign mailers where he was born. The letter also questions whether he forces his wife into a subservient role, as do some observers of sharia. In addition, the letter says that designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) endorses Odeh and claims the group has links to terrorism (It does) . In a statement to the Times, CAIR Florida's government affairs director Laila Abdelaziz said, 'This unfounded and slanderous attack on Mr. Odeh is concerning, and we hope Temple Terrace residents, community leaders and neighbors will reject its Islamophobic message.' Still, Temple Terrace City Council member Grant Rimbey said he worries the truth may not matter to a certain block of voters. 'That is the sad reality,' Rimbey said. 'I think there is racism in the city' and there are people 'who want to keep Temple Terrace looking like it did in 1952 forever.' (What 'race' is Islam?) Rimbey and Odeh estimate that 20 to 25 percent of Temple Terrace's population is Muslim. (Now, that really IS disturbing '“ more Muslim block-busting) Six candidates have applied for two open seats on the council; the two candidates recording the most votes Nov. 8 will fill the positions. Odeh said he invites anyone with questions about Muslims to reach out to him '” including the author of the anonymous letter. 'If he wanted to learn more, he should have come to me directly.' (He learned everything he needed to know about Muslims on 9/11)

BNI Store Oct 26 2016 Always under fire from designated terrorist group CAIR, former FBI agent and counter-terrorism expert, John Guandolo, is the go-to person for training law enforcement officers about the growing threat Islam poses to America Every time Guandolo is scheduled to give a speech or a training session, CAIR thugs try to shut him down in advance. At the recent Breaking the Silence ' conference in Colorado Springs, Guandolo warned that Muslims in America are getting jobs at airports, hotels, convenience stores and cab companies as part of a growing 'insurgency' and an 'intentional plan' to 'occupy the land.' 'Why are they building huge, $100 million mosques in areas where there are like 100 or 90 Muslims?' he asked. 'Because, when they build a mosque they're claiming territory, now all they have to do is occupy it. So they're calling Muslims to occupy the land. All of this, they have an intentional plan and it's based in Islamic doctrine and they're putting it to work through what they're doing.' CAIR's relentless harassment of John Guandolo:

BNI Store Oct 27 2016 GERMANY: Gang of Syrian Muslim boys banned from swimming pool after sexually molesting girls as young as nine How about banning ALL Muslims? Police have launched an investigation after a gang of young Syrian asylum-seekers sexually harassed three schoolgirls at their local swimming pool. The girls '“ sisters aged 9, 11 and 14 '“ were surrounded and molested by seven Muslims, the youngest of whom was just seven. UK Express (h/t Terry D) The father of the schoolgirls said he had dropped them off at the swimming pool as a treat for the older girl's 14th birthday. He said as soon as they started swimming they were harassed by the Muslim boys who surrounded them in the pool. The man said: 'Five of the boys touched the girls' breasts and bottoms.' He said his 11 year-old daughter managed to get away from the youths and ran to the pool supervisor to ask for help. Guess these girls didn't have the 'Don't rape me' tattoos Germany has been giving out A police spokeswoman said the suspects were being investigated for sexual offences. She said one of the boys was 14-years-old and the rest were children between the seven and eleven. The spokeswoman said: 'The suspects are said to have swam after the girls and to then have grabbed them.' The boys were all interviewed by police before being handed over to their parents after the incident in the Mariendorf district of Berlin. A spokeswoman for the swimming pool said the boys had all been banned for one year. (That's all?) According to local reports, many girls have been victims of sexual assault by Muslim boys at the same swimming pool in Mariendorf.

BNI Store Oct 27 2016 UK Child Protection Services workers are 'afraid' to challenge the ages of Muslim invaders for fear of ending up in court Industry insiders reveal they often meet obviously adult-aged Muslim invaders posing as children who are permitted to stay in the country because challenging them can put their career at risk. The revelations came after the arrivals of Muslim 'child' economic freeloaders from Calais '“ who apparently are much older than the teenage years they had claimed. UK Express (h/t Terry D) Britain was once again divided over the issue with Conservative MP David Davies suggesting they should be made to undergo dental tests to establish their age. His comments were met with fury by the British Dental Association (BDA) which said tests were 'invasive' '“ a statement which was backed by the Home Office. But, speaking to Express Online a social worker who asked not to be named has revealed the REAL struggles faced by those in the industry. According to the specialist THREE professionals are assigned to the first meeting with a migrant who claims to be a child. And senior child protection officers are at their wits' end. He said: 'So a social worker is assigned the case. The social worker attends the assessment and because the asylum seeker is claiming to be under 17 (to come under the children's Act) an appropriate adult is also in attendance and so is an interpreter. 'Usually they enter the room and they see this asylum seeker is well over 17. It is that obvious. 'After they have done the process three times all three social workers have to come to a consensus on the estimated age of the asylum seeker '“ so let's says all three say this asylum seeker is well over 17 or 18 years old. You would think that would be the end of the process, but not so. 'They tell their managers of their decisions and then the manager tells them 'If that's your decision then okay but the asylum seeker will now be assigned a solicitor to challenge your opinion and you are likely to be cross examined in court'. After this phase of the investigation is complete, if a social worker chooses to challenge the age, they are reportedly met with anger and abuse. Many, he claims, have received calls calling them 'racist' and have had complaints made against them. Those put in this position have said they 'cannot afford' to fight it. One said: 'I just sign and say he's under 17 years because it's not worth the hassle.' Social workers and child protection experts have called the system 'broken' in Britain. Aid workers in Calais recently admitted to the press child migrants ARE lying about their age to get to the front of the queue to Britain '“ and are shredding their real documents. RELATED STORIES:

BNI Store Oct 27 2016 GERMANY: Parents outraged after German primary school 'forces' children to chant 'Allahu Akbar' and 'there is no God but Allah' in Muslim prayer The father of the pupil at the girl's primary school in German ski resort Garmisch-Partenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the Islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given. He claimed she had been 'forced' by teachers to memorize the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24. UK Express (h/t Terry D) The handout read: 'Oh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you.' It had been given to the girl during a lesson in 'ethics' at the Bavarian school. Headteacher Gisela Herl did not confirm the incident when questioned, but said the school would issue a written statement detailing its position in the coming week. The incident comes just weeks after parents complained to German newspaper Hessian NiedersÃ¤chsische Allgemeine (HNA) that their children's nursery was refusing to acknowledge 'Christmas rituals' to accommodate the 'diverse cultures' of other pupils. The Sara Nussbaum House daycare centre in Kassel refused to put up a Christmas tree, tell Christmas stories or celebrate Christmas in general because it said only a minority of pupils. A spokesman for Kassel explained: 'There will be no Christmas celebrations, in the strictest sense. Because the majority of children at this kindergarten are not Christian the festival will not be celebrated in the way that it is at other schools.' Migrants now outnumber native children at many schools in Germany as the country has been inundated with Muslim migrants in recent years. More than one million migrants are estimated to have arrived in Germany during the last year alone. The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees estimates that another 200,000 Muslims will apply for asylum in 2017.

The irony is that the LGBTQWERTY community is almost uniformly liberal. They support the people who are stoning them, throwing them from buildings, and hanging them. They have ceded any influence with the political Right, as no matter what the Right does, they will not get any meaningful Gay support. That means that just or unjust, there is absolutely no upside to supporting Gay issues. There is a small upside from the Christian Right, to pissing on them. 
Meanwhile, although we disagree on some major issues, we are probably their best friends. We are the people who would die to protect them.

HILLARY'S (Islamic) AMERICA IS ALREADY HERE where 'Muslim NO-GO ZONES' are popping up all over Michiganistan The rest of America may be agonizing over the security implications of taking in potential Islamic jihadists posing as refugees. But Syrian Muslim invaders are being welcomed with open arms in Hamtramck, Michigan '“ America's first and only majority Muslim city. Non-Muslim residents in the Dearborn area are saying 'You know, we're getting ready to sell and get out of here.'' (Before property values tank as a result of the Muslim invasion with a mosque on every corner, blasting amplified Islamic Calls to Prayer several times a day) WND ( h/t Liz) Once 90 percent Polish Catholic, the blue-collar enclave just outside Detroit has been transformed by successive waves of immigrants from Bangladesh, Yemen and Bosnia. Muslims now outnumber non-Muslims, the council has a Muslim majority and the call to prayer echoes through the streets five times a day. 'They're setting this all up so they can continue their ancient squabbles that they have carried on for centuries in the Middle East right here your neighborhood,' Corcoran said. They call it 'culture shift.' Places, in America, that no longer look or feel like America. (In Europe, they are referred to as NO-GO Zones) Cedar Riverside in Minneapolis fits the bill, with its large Somali community known as 'Little Mogadishu,' as does and Hamtramck, Michigan, where the Islamic call to prayer is shouted over loudspeakers and the local city council is now majority-Muslim . Parts of Amarillo, Texas, have been flooded with so many Muslim refugees that some ethnic enclaves claim to have elected their own tribal leaders independent of the city government, the city's mayor recently testified before the Texas Legislature . Then there is Dearborn, Michigan, which is now 40 percent Muslim and spilling over into neighboring cities and towns. Documentary filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch recently drove through Dearborn, guided by a lifelong resident of the city named Brian (see video below). What Brian showed him was not just a culture shift but something closer to a shock. Women walk the streets dressed in long, black burqas that cover all but their eyes. Almost all the signs on storefronts are in Arabic or some other Middle Eastern dialect. Arab businessmen buy up commercial properties, force out the American tenants and replace them with similar businesses run by Muslims, Brian told Lynch in the documentary. The same phenomenon is now beginning to occur in nearby Sterling Heights, Troy, Oak Park and Clinton Township. In Sterling Heights, residents informed WND this week that Middle Eastern refugees are being housed in a local hotel owned by an Arab-American businessman. But in Dearborn, the tremendous growth in the Muslim community started more than 20 years ago, fueled by local universities and industry. Muslims voting for Muslims only 'Brian still lives there. He's not going anywhere,' Lynch told WND in an interview. 'It depends on where you go in the city, but certain segments are 100 percent Muslim. Brian said to be prepared. We went through the areas, went shopping at the food mart. You really don't feel like you are in America anymore.' Lynch said he was a regular contributor on Fox News between 2012 and 2015, until he started making hard-hitting documentaries on the U.S. immigration system. In certain areas in Dearborn. 'You have two areas, and it's almost like the Ford plants separate the two sides, and when you cross to the other side it's totally radical again. We went to a park where kids were playing after school with the mothers all there, and everybody was dressed in full burqa. It was almost like it was Halloween. I'd never seen anything like it in my life.' Dearborn does not exist on an island. Residents of southeastern Michigan have every reason to expect their towns will one day look like Dearborn, Lynch said, thanks to President Obama's Syrian refugee resettlement program, which Hillary Clinton says she'd like to expand by more than 500 percent. This is 'Hillary's America,' says a resident of nearby Rochester Hills who is one of the co-founders of SecureMichigan.org , a group that started up last year with the mission of helping educate Michiganders about Shariah law and Islamic settlements. He said the Islamization is literally moving from town to town in Oakland, Macomb and Wayne counties. 'The Sterling Heights story is significant because we have these budding 'Shariahvilles' in Michigan,' he said. 'We know there are refugees being planted. Now, in Rochester Hills, I've got five covered women walking down my street, and that's never happened until two weeks ago.' In one 18-day period from Oct. 1 through Oct. 18, the U.S. State Department and its federal contractors have sent 199 Syrians to three counties in southeast Michigan '“ Oakland, Macomb and Wayne '“and Oakland County leaders have not received any advance notice of the arrivals, said sources familiar with the growing controversy. The government contractors secretly planting the refugees in southeast Michigan are Lutheran Services/Samaritas, Catholic Charities of Southeast Michigan, USRI and Episcopal Migration Services. In Dearborn, the tremendous growth in the Muslim community started more than 20 years ago, fueled by local universities and industry. 'Brian still lives there. He's not going anywhere,' Lynch told WND in an interview. 'It depends on where you go in the city, but certain segments are 100 percent Muslim. Brian said to be prepared. We went through the areas, went shopping at the food mart. You really Dearborn is but a harbinger of things to come for many more cities and towns across America if Hillary Clinton is elected president of the United States. 'I think if she gets elected you're going to see more immigration from Mideast countries than under any of the previous presidents including Obama, because she obviously has ties to those countries, getting an incredible amount of money donated from them,' Lynch said. 'These donations come with strings. They come with side deals, and we don't know what they are. It may be something as simple as 'OK, we want to see more immigration from our country or some other country into the United States.' Why else is there any need to increase the Syrian refugee settlements in America? There's no reason. 'If you look at all at the pay-for-play things, Muslims have said they want to spread Islam across the globe. The one country that doesn't have that much of it is the United States.' Member of first Muslim-majority City Council warns: 'Today we show the Polish''¦thatMuslims are in charge. Within moments of winning the city's election, an organizer involved in the government takeover was caught making ominous threats against non-Muslims in the city. HillaryDaily T his warning is no doubt troubling in its own right, but becomes even more unsettling when one pairs the comment with recent polling that suggests what Muslims would do should they take over any facet of government. Over half reject the first amendment, while 46% want blasphemers punished. 12% percent would even like to see those who commit blasphemy killed outright. Given their comments about the white population in the area, coupled with the sobering statistics outlined in the recent poll, it looks as if the city of Hamtramck, Michigan may be faced with a extremist city council under which they must be governed.

BNI Store Oct 28 2016 BELGIUM: Iranian Muslim invader found guilty of drugging, repeatedly raping, and threatening to kill a 15-year-old Belgian schoolgirl, GETS NO JAIL TIME! An Iranian Muslim illegal alien migrant who threatened to kill a runaway schoolgirl if she screamed as he repeatedly raped her has been spared any jail in a shock sentencing. The 20-year-old Muslim whose identity is being protected ( why? ), was found guilty of drugging, raping, and threatening the young girl by the court in Tongeren, Belgium. But the typical Muslim pervert has been spared jail in a shock verdict '“ and got away with a suspended sentence. UK Express The harrowing incident happened in April 2014, after the young girl and a female friend ran away from their hometown of Bertem. When the friend decided to return home two days later, the 15-year-old carried on her journey '“ taking a bus from Hasselt to Genk on her own. There, after arriving at 11pm on April 20, she took up with a gang of other young people who were hanging around in the city centre, and was taken to one of their apartments where she was plied with alcohol and drugs. The young girl later fell asleep at the flat, but was woken up just hours later by the 20-year-old Iranian Muslim who repeatedly raped her. During the horrific sex attack, she was bitten by her abuser and nearly suffocated after he put his hands around her throat to stop her screaming. He threatened to kill her if she continued to call for help. The court heard that after the attack, she did not dare to ask for help any more and feared the rest of the group could burst in at any minute and rape her as well. 'Rape is the most natural thing in the world,' and 'women must obey men,' were just two of the defenses offered by some of the seven Muslim invaders recently arrested for a gang rape of an unconscious 17-year-old white girl in Ostend, Belgium However, despite the aggressive nature of the attack, the migrant has been spared jail. Handing him a suspended sentence, the judge also fined the Iranian Â£3,680 in compensation to the girl and her family. The sentencing comes just days after an Iraqi asylum seeker had his rape conviction overturned , after his defence lawyers claimed he did not know his 10-year-old victim did not want to be raped.

DEAD MUSLIMS SOCIETY will sue to force small Massachusetts town to allocate space for 16,000 dead Muslims Negotiations to put a Muslim cemetery in the small town of Dudley have broken down in acrimony, and the contentious issue '” replete with charges and countercharges of bigotry and grandstanding '” appears to be headed for resolution in the courts, aided and abetted by the litigation jihadists of designated terrorist group CAIR. Boston Globe The Islamic Society of Greater Worcester ended talks this week after the Board of Selectmen did not accept its latest proposal for a graveyard on 55 acres of abandoned farmland , according to the society's attorney. A counter-offer by the town also was not accepted. Neither side provided details of the private discussions. People are opposed to casket free Muslim burials which could contaminate the water supply Jay Talerman, the Islamic Society attorney, said Thursday the group will now pursue the plan in the courts, following a 10-month process that failed to produce an agreement but generated plenty of heated rhetoric. 'Each time, the selectmen retreated to a position that involved violating my client's rights,' Talerman said. 'The most disappointing part appears to be that they never sincerely or genuinely had any intention to accommodate us.' (What a surprise. NOT) A suit filed by the society is pending in Massachusetts Land Court. In addition, the ACLU of Massachusetts is preparing to file a civil rights suit in US District Court, said Sarah Wunsch, the organization's deputy legal director. The Obama thugs of the US Attorney's Office in Boston already has launched an investigation into whether civil rights violations occurred. The state Attorney General's office has been in talks with both sides. The town's attorney, Gary Brackett, said that the issue always has been about the size and impact of the cemetery '” not whether one would be permitted. Throughout the process, Talerman said, 'the selectmen never expressed a willingness to abandon procedures that are a direct affront to my clients.' Brackett denounced Talerman's repeated accusations that anti-Muslim bias tainted the cemetery application. Large crowds have come out to every meeting to protest the proposed cemetery 'I would compare Mr. Talerman's broad-brush claims regarding the citizens and officials of the town of Dudley as being the equivalent of Donald Trump's attempt at portraying Muslims,' Brackett said. Dr. Amjad Bahnassi, the president of the Islamic Society, said he attributed part of the opposition to a 'misunderstanding' of the Muslim religion and said the issue has become a civil rights concern for many of the estimated 5,000 Muslims in Worcester County. 'We're being denied unfairly what is granted to us by the law,' Bahnassi said. At issue is the Islamic Society's attempt to buy farmland with enough space for an estimated 16,000 graves that, if filled, would be the largest Muslim cemetery in the state. The society currently uses a graveyard in Enfield, Conn., 60 miles from Worcester, which Muslim leaders said poses a hardship for many families. When the society's plans became public early this year, townspeople expressed fears that burials would contaminate well water, because Muslims traditionally do not use coffins, and that the nearby rural roads would become congested. Muslim leaders continued to pursue their application through town government, even though Talerman said the society was not required to seek approval because the organization is a religious group seeking the land for a religious purpose. The town's Zoning Board of Appeals rejected the cemetery application in June, and the Islamic Society filed suit in Land Court. The town also began efforts to buy the land under a right of first refusal for certain agricultural property. However, the Islamic Society, which already had signed a purchase-and-sale agreement for the property, argued again that the town had no such right. Facing intensifying pressure, the town eventually waived that claim. On Thursday, Talerman reiterated his longstanding contention that bigotry lies behind the lack of an agreement. 'We gave this town an opportunity to lock arms with us and welcome a benign use into their town that would dispel any notion that they were biased or bigoted,' he said. 'They have not taken up the olive branch and instead have doubled down on strategies that are solely intended to delay or kill our project.'

NO-GO Zones are violent and lawless Muslim migrant dominated neighborhoods around Paris that are virtually off limits to non-Muslims and a threat to police and firefighters. Gatestone (h/t Brenda K) There is a mountain of evidence that confirms the existence of Muslim 'NO GO ZONES' (Zones Urbaines Sensibles) where non-Muslims are afraid to go because they regularly are attacked by gangs of Muslims who rule these lawless neighborhoods. Host-country authorities have effectively lost control over many no-go zones and are often unable or unwilling to provide even basic public aid, such as police, fire fighting and ambulance services, out of fear of being attacked by Muslim youth. Muslim enclaves in European cities are also breeding grounds for Islamic radicalism and pose a significant threat to Western security. Europe's no-go zones are the by-product of decades of multicultural policies that have encouraged Muslim immigrants to create parallel societies and remain segregated from '” rather than become integrated into '” their European host nations. A 120-page research paper entitled 'No-Go Zones in the French Republic: Myth or Reality?' documented dozens of French neighborhoods 'where police and gendarmerie cannot enforce the Republican order or even enter without risking confrontation, projectiles, or even fatal shootings.' A landmark 2,200-page report, 'Banlieue de la RÃ©publique' (Suburbs of the Republic) found that Seine-Saint-Denis and other Parisian suburbs are becoming 'separate Islamic societies' cut off from the French state, and where Islamic Sharia law is rapidly displacing French civil law. The report said that Muslim immigrants are increasingly rejecting French values and instead are immersing themselves in literal violent Islam. The problem of no-go zones is well documented, but multiculturalists and their politically correct supporters vehemently deny that they exist. Some are now engaged in a concerted campaign to discredit and even silence those who draw attention to the issue. A 120-page research paper entitled 'No-Go Zones in the French Republic: Myth or Reality?' documented dozens of French neighborhoods 'where police and gendarmerie cannot enforce the Republican order or even enter without risking confrontation, projectiles, or even fatal shootings.' In October 2011, a 2,200-page report, 'Banlieue de la RÃ©publique' (Suburbs of the Republic) found that Seine-Saint-Denis and other Parisian suburbs are becoming 'separate Islamic societies' cut off from the French state and where Islamic Sharia law is rapidly displacing French civil law. The report also showed how the problem is being exacerbated by radical Muslim preachers who are promoting the social marginalization of Muslim immigrants in order to create a parallel Muslim society in France that is ruled by Sharia law. The television presenter asks: 'What if we went to the suburbs?' Obertone replies: 'I do not recommend this. Not even we French dare go there anymore. But nobody talks about this in public, of course. Nor do those who claim, 'long live multiculturalism,' and 'Paris is wonderful!' dare enter the suburbs.' Back in 2015, the Mayor of Paris threatened to sue FOX News for reporting on the problem of Muslim NO-GO Zones. As a result, several FOX commentators were forced to issue apologies on the air for claiming after the Charlie Hebdo attack that there are Muslim-ruled 'no-go zones' in France.

ITALY: African Muslim illegal alien freeloaders are demanding to have designer clothes and better food African MUSLIM illegal migrants who took the streets in protest and blocked traffic in Venice this week are now demanding real designer clothes (Armani and Hugo Boss), no knockoffs, and say they don't like having to eat so much pasta in their meals. Breitbart (h/t Emma) Lorenzo Chinalleto, whose cooperative hosts migrants at the Hotel Byron in the Venice province, said migrants respond with displeasure when receiving clothes from Catholic charity Caritas and other charitable bodies, because the goods are unbranded. He explained: 'Unfortunately they come to Italy with the asylum reception systems of northern Europe as a model. When they arrived we gave them clothes, standard clothes. 'But they want brand-name clothes like Armani and Boss, and they asked for Pirelli shoes. These are their models. When they came to us, they didn't have clothes, but they all had smartphones,' the Italian added . Forty of the migrants hosted at the Hotel Byron took to the streets to express their dissatisfaction, blocking the traffic. In a video (below) taken outside the hotel on Monday protesters can be seen shouting, in English, that they don't want to eat pasta. The migrants originate mostly from Senegal, Nigeria, Somalia, Mali and Ghana, Il Gazzettino reported . Migrants frequently hit the headlines in Italy protesting their living conditions in the country, which has recently been hit hard by several earthquakes. In May a group of 'unaccompanied minors' launched a violent protest in order to be transferred from Fondachelli Fantina, complaining that there were 'too few entertainment possibilities' in the town. After they had completely destroyed the reception centre to the point where it cannot be used again, the Interior Ministry transferred the migrants to a luxury hotel. In June migrants staying in a small town in Sardinia protested for several days demanding better meals, a television set in every room, and a daily coach to take them to the island's capital, Cagliari. Tensions in the town ran high as the migrants brandished sticks and smashed property. Regional director of the populist Sardinian Action Party, Marcello OrrÃ¹, commented on the controversy. He said: 'It is intolerable for us to continue to accept these people who don't like the welcome offered, the meals and their lodgings at the hotel for free. And who then protest to have a television in the room and a daily bus take them to Cagliari for free. 'It's too easy to accuse us of racism and xenophobia, but we refuse to accept this total and grave injustice to the Sardinian people. These boys are muscular and equipped with the latest model iPhones. 'I say if they want a TV in the room and maybe even a masseuse, they must be loaded on a ship and sent back to Africa immediately. With a one-way ticket'.

Why Iranian-American pastor held hostage in Iran is voting for Donald Trump Iranian-American Pastor Saeed Abedini is brimming with gratitude for one U.S. presidential aspirant: Donald Trump. Christian Today In a surprising revelation, Abedini said the Republican presidential nominee helped provide for the needs of his family in Boise, Idaho while he was locked up in an Iranian prison for his faith. The pastor said Trump gave his family $10,000 while he was imprisoned for three and a half years. 'I am finally free in a free country. Last year on the same day I was sick and in chains for Christ, and now I can vote to choose my next president,' Abedini said in a post on his Facebook page on Sunday. 'And most amazingly, I can vote for someone that I know fought for me and called my name so many times. He met my family and gave them a $10,000 gift. I think his ideas are more biblical than the other candidates,' he added. In contrast, Abedini said Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton did not do or say anything to help secure his release from Iranian prison. The pastor said Clinton never spoke his name or met his family. Abedini family As a woman who says she stands for women's rights when she was foreign minister, she never contacted my mom, wife, sister or my daughter. She never did anything to help when I was in prison as an American pastor who was detained in Iran as a hostage,' he wrote. (Probably because she was too busy figuring out how to get more Iranian Muslims into the country) Last week, Abedini said he already cast an early vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

UNIDENTIFIED (MUSLIM?) 'knifeman' on the run after stabbing four people at a Frankfurt train station The attack this afternoon occurred at Hauptwache Station and police have said there are four victims. At this stage the motive for the stabbings is not clear. ( It will become crystal clear once you identify the attacker as a Muslim ) UK Daily Mail (h/t larr) The local police force confirmed the attack by Tweeting: 'There was a knife assault at the #Hauptwache in #Frankfurt. 'That's why so many colleagues [police officers] and rescue workers there.' Frankfurt Police confirmed all four victims were still in hospital. A video of the bloody aftermath was captured on what is understood to be level B of the station. The incident was at 5.30pm local time, according to Hessenschau , who report the stabbings came after a group were quarreling. A dispute had started on one platform and spilled over onto another one. There was more bloodshed in a separate incident at the station, understood to be on a passenger train between Hauptwache and Taunusanlage. A dispute between two passengers broke out into a fight, according to Hessenschau , which led to glass being broken and people suffering cuts. Frankfurt police looked to reassure the public by tweeting: 'If we recognized a threat to the local population we would communicate this.' (No, you wouldn't) The stabbings will still raise fears the attack was ISLAMIC terror-related after a string of incidents across Europe over recent months. Germany has been rocked by ISLAMIC terror attacks this year, heaping pressure on chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door MUSLIM immigration policy. A bloody week of violence that rocked Germany began on July 18 when Pakistani MUSLIM teenager Riaz Khan Ahmadzai, 17, posing as an Afghan refugee, hacked at passengers on a train in Wurzburg with an axe, wounding five. Four days later, a German-Iranian MUSLIM teenager Ali Sonboly shot nine people dead during a rampage through a shopping centre in Munich before taking his own life.

BNI Store Oct 29 2016 EU using taxpayer money to give Muslim invaders in Turkey free debit cards and cash transfers to keep them out of Europe As many as one million illegal alien Muslim colonizers in Turkey will receive debit cards and monthly cash transfers to help pay for food and housing under a new â‚¬348 million ($393 million) humanitarian program from the European Union. ZeroHedge The EU's largest-ever humanitarian program is part of a â‚¬3 billion package of assistance the bloc promised Turkey to support some three million refugees the country hosts, mainly from Syria. The new EU program will be overseen by the World Food Program, in cooperation with the Turkish Red Crescent. Each family's need will be assessed individually and there are additional funds available for education or supporting elderly family members. Step-by-Step Progression into a sinkhole for the EU More refugees will seek free handouts. Turkey will complain â‚¬3 billion is not enough. The refugees will complain â‚¬1,000 is not enough. EU citizens will wonder why refugees are getting â‚¬1,000 and they are not. Demands for an EU-wide helicopter drop of free debit cards will soar. The amounts demanded will soar. Some economist will propose the debit cards will expire if not used quickly. And then, and then '¦.Under Eurozone rules the ECB cannot simply print money and give it away. Countries have budget constraints. So, either taxes go up to pay for the scheme, or the EMU rules have to change. Western media are reporting on the Muslim refugee crisis as a humanitarian problem for the West only. But where are the media questions about the huge financial and land resources available in the Arab Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, and the UAE? So far, the richest Arab Muslim countries in the Middle East have taken in virtually no Muslim refugees. Liveleak The world is often lectured to about the urgency of respecting Arab and Islamic brotherly love, but where is the Arab action to rescue fellow Muslims and Arabs from the claws of ISIS? Where are the mighty Arab armies who waged dozens of wars against Israel? Why aren't they fighting ISIS and building tent cities in the vast deserts of Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and the wealthy Gulf States? Where is the wealthy Arab League to coordinate safe cities on Arab land that extends from Morocco to Iraq and from Northern Syria to Sudan? Kuwaiti official explains why Kuwait will NOT take in any Syrian refugees 'Kuwait and other oil-rich Muslim countries are too valuable to accept low-class Muslim refugees who we will have to support because they don't want to work. We don't want people who are different from us.'

SWEDEN HELP WANTED: Activities Coordinator for bored illegal alien Muslim freeloaders and rapists Muslim illegal alien invaders taking up space in Sweden and living off the government dole, say they are vandalizing and burning cars (not to mention gang-raping Swedish girls) because they do not have enough 'activities' to keep them busy. Friatider 'It is clear as hell that we take out our frustration by destroying and vandalizing when we have a shortage of activities here,' one of the illegals living in Skallberget in Vasteras writes in a letter to the editor in the local newspaper VLT.

BNI Store Oct 30 2016 GERMAN 'GESTAPO' considers prosecuting parents who refused to allow their son to go on a field trip to mosque Parents of a German teenager may face a trial for refusing to pay 'truancy' fine after refusing to allow their son to go to a local mosque on a school field trip out of fear that it would lead to his indoctrination by Muslim leaders. RT The story broke in mid-June, when parents of a 13-year-old student opposed the idea of their son visiting a mosque in the northern German town of Rendsburg, reportedly organized as part of a geography class. 'What a trip to the mosque has to do with geography classes?' Arthur Dent asked. Others compared the authorities' actions to the darkest part of German history, with one user tweeting: 'Visiting mosques is a top priority under our regime, similar to having a Fuhrer's image in everyone's flat.' In a letter to the class teacher quoted by the NDR, the teen's father argued that his son would be 'indoctrinated' in the mosque. He went on to say that 'for years we have been hearing reports about religiously-motivated violence connected with Islamic people.' The parents' lawyer, Alexander Heumann, argues that they refused the school trip out of fear for their son's 'bodily safety.' Denying any faith-based motives, he emphasized that the couple do not belong to any religious group, and are of the opinion that 'nobody shall be forced into a sacred place against his good will.' Heumann himself, however, is a former member of the Alternative for Germany party, an anti-immigrant political group, and was a participant in setting up the 'Dugida,' a Dusseldorf-based branch of the far-right PEGIDA movement. According to the NDR report, the parents met the lawyer through the 'Pax Europa' movement, a civic group which opposes the perceived 'Islamization of Europe.' A local education authority subsequently fined the couple a total of â‚¬300 ($328). When the parents opposed the fine, their case was forwarded to Peter Mueller-Rakow, a local prosecutor, who will decide whether or not to proceed with a court trial.

KANSAS: Republican Mailer asks voters 'Have you met the new neighbors?' (your 'Muslim terrorist' neighbors) The Kansas Republican Party is sending out mailers in legislative races around the state depicting ISIS fighters and explosions from MUSLIM terrorist attacks. A mailer going to homes in east Wichita's House District 88 shows an ISIS fighter holding a machine gun with a message that reads: 'Have you met the new neighbors?' Wichita Eagle The other side of the mailer touts Republican Rep. Joseph Scapa's support for funding to train Kansas law enforcement officers to 'recognize and deal with foreign and domestic threats to our state, from those who support ideologies that are in conflict with the U.S. Constitution and our Kansas values.' Clay Barker, executive director of the Kansas Republican Party, said similar mailers are being sent out around the state. 'We did polling and focus groups, and the one issue that got overwhelming positive response and was associated with Republicans was safety,' Barker said. 'You know, Gitmo, that article that came out back in August that ISIS had named soldiers for assassinations, police being shot and those knuckleheads in Garden City, it all kind of added up to a security issue '¦ the whole feeling that's there violence out there. And it's a positive issue for Republicans.' The Republican mailer specifically depicts ISIS, the Islamic terror group that controls parts of Syria and Iraq. Robert McCraw, director of government affairs for the designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) in Washington, D.C., called the mailers 'a shameful example of scare mongering tactics that I hope the Republican Party can learn to move away from.' He said it was appalling for the state party 'to falsely insinuate that the state's Muslim population is linked to terror groups like ISIS.' 'This flier verges on incitement of violence to Muslims.' The Republican-controlled Legislature has passed resolutions opposing the possible transfer of Guantanamo detainees to Fort Leavenworth. Barker said there are several variations of the mailers. One depicts an explosion from a terrorist attack. 'It's one of the few (issues) that was a clear, like high 80 percent positive and associated with Republicans,' Barker said. It's not only Republicans who don't want Gitmo terrorists in Kansas Barker also said the party is sending out mailers highlighting Republicans' support for ousting four of the sitting Kansas Supreme Court justices, portraying Democrats who support retaining the justices as soft on crime. Rep. Joseph Scapa, who said he saw the mailer before it was sent out, focused his comments about the mailer more on Muslim refugees, who he says pose a potential security threat. 'We have people coming into our state from parts of the world who believe in ideologies that are incompatible with the United States Constitution and our Kansas values and that poses a threat,' Scapa said. 'We know for a fact that we cannot vet the people that are coming into our state from other parts of the world '¦ where they believe in ideologies that we don't.' 20-year-old Kansas Muslim convert John T. Booker, Jr., could face life in prison for allegedly plotting to bomb a U.S. military base. Scapa's opponent, Democrat Elizabeth Bishop, criticized the mail campaign, saying the mailers could contribute to animosity toward Muslims in Wichita. (One can only hope) Led by Republican Governor Sam Brownback the state of Kansas informed the Obama administration this week that it is defying its dictates for Kansas to cooperate in the resettlement of refugees from Syria. In a letter to Robert Carey, director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, Brownback wrote, 'The State of Kansas hereby withdraws its Refugee Resettlement Program State Plan and terminates its participation in all federal refugee resettlement grants and programs, effective at the earliest possible date.' Hopefully, they are the last Brownback added that he was taking his action to 'protect the safety and security interests of the State of Kansas.'

NETHERLANDS has a new Muslim political party called 'DENK' (Think) created by Muslim colonizers for Muslim colonizers Founded by 2 Turkish Muslims, Tunahan Kuzu and SelÃ§uk Ã–ztÃ¼rk, after being booted out of the Dutch Labour Party, the Denk Partij (Think Party) is the first political force in Europe established by Muslims and is attracting controversy for its affiliation with the Turkish Islamist regime, rejection of the Armenian Genocide, and radical anti-Israel positions. DENK is also proposing a 1,000 strong 'racism' police and national anti-immigration registry which will target anyone who says anything 'Islamophobic' against Muslims. Legal Insurrection is reporting ( h/t Truth Revolt ) that the Netherlands' pro-Muslim immigration Denk Party is pushing for a thousand-strong 'Racism Police' to go after thought and speech crimes against Muslims which would result in a registry for offenders, fines, and re-education camps. The party, dominated by members of Turkish and Muslim origin was founded in 2014 by two former-socialist Turkish politicians but it already sits in the Dutch parliament and is hoping to mobilize the country's million-strong mainly Muslim immigrant population (out of about 17 million overall) and growing Muslim population, currently at about 7 percent, in the parliamentary elections to be held early next year. Tunahan Kuzu and SelÃ§uk Ã–ztÃ¼rk Among the Denk Party's latest proposals are the renaming of streets and tunnels suggestive of Dutch colonial and slave trading history, changing the term 'foreigner' to 'Turkish and Surinamese Dutch person,' creating a thousand-man 'Racism Police,' establishing stricter sentences for 'racist and discriminatory behavior,' and listing offenders on a nationwide 'Racism Register' '” you know, just like child molesters.

What should worry the freedom-loving people '” on the either side of the Atlantic '” is not just the outrageous nature of Denk Party's proposals, but the determined effort already underway in Europe to criminalize 'undesired' speech and political dissident. The E.U. has long been pressuring its media to omit mentions of Islam when Muslims are involved in terrorism. UK Express DENK proposes a ban on words like 'native' and 'immigrant' would be introduced, alongside a national holiday to celebrate Muslim diversity. The party aims to reinvent Dutch national identity, and the program is geared towards tackling the institutional racism/Islamophobia it says is endemic in the Netherlands. And part of that is scrapping the government's ideals of integration, claiming this should not be expected of Muslim migrants, but rather an atmosphere of 'mutual acceptance' should be adopted. (In other words, forcing Dutch natives to give up their customs and culture and accommodate the Muslim way of doing things) Tackling racism/Islamophobia should begin in schools, with pro-Islam attitudes promoted in the classroom through citizenship classes, and that students are regularly tested to see if they are meeting the required benchmark.

BNI Store Oct 31 2016 It isn't 'Islamophobia' when an Oklahoma GOP State Rep. says 'Islam is a cancer in our nation that needs to be cut out' Unfortunately, some Christians in Oklahoma, where there has been one savage beheading of a Christian woman by a Muslim and at least one other beheading attempt, seem to think so, and blindly condemn all outspoken critics of Islam'¦especially the Christians. Nondoc Whining about so-called 'Islamophobia is exactly what James Davenport, a Christian political science professor of at Rose State College, is doing . Specifically, he attacks State Rep. John Bennett for holding an interim stud y this past week on the impact of 'radical Islam, Shariah Law, the Muslim Brotherhood and the radicalization process' on Oklahoma and the nation. During the course of this study, Rep. Bennett referred to Adam Soltani, the executive director for designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations chapter of Oklahoma), and Imam Imad Enchassi, of the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City, as 'terrorists.' As someone who grew up in the Evangelical Christian tradition, and as someone who believes religious freedom remains a fundamental principle of our system of government, I am both offended and saddened at this spectacle. I am offended that a state representative from my state would use the cloak of Christianity to spew hate and bigotry such as this. I am also offended that he would do so while arguing he is defending freedom. Imam Enchassi then got up from his seat in the audience and hugged two members of other faiths who were in attendance. Bennett asked Rep. Randy Grau, R-Edmond, chairman of the Judiciary and Civil Procedure Committee, to admonish members of the audience not to hug a Muslim. In fact, during one exchange between Bennett and Imam Enchassi, the Imam stated, 'It's a free country,' to which Bennett, who served in the U.S. Marines replied, 'I know, I fought for it in two wars.' John Guandolo, the founder of UnderstandingtheThreat.com , who served in the Marines and is a former FBI agent, said the Islamic movement in Oklahoma has made significant strides, and he called CAIR-Oklahoma executive director Adam Soltani a terrorist. Under questioning from Bennett, Guandolo said groups in the country's jihadi network use relationships with other faiths as a tool. But one wonders what, exactly, Bennett fought for. It clearly wasn't freedom. Neither freedom of religion nor freedom of association seem high on his list of priorities, especially if you happen to be a member of Islam. Perhaps he was fighting for Christianity. The problem with that line of reasoning is there rests absolutely no instruction in the New Testament for believers to physically fight for Christ, or for the faith. In fact, if one were to hold strictly to Christ's own words on this, one could easily reach the conclusion that Christ expects us not to fight for him (read John 18:36 ). So if Bennett wasn't fighting for freedom, and he wasn't fighting for Christianity, what was he fighting for? Perhaps he should spend more time reading the history of his own faith rather than fretting about the supposed threat from Muslims. He would find that this combining of religion and state power never ends well '” for anyone. I also mentioned I was saddened by this event. That sadness comes from the fact that I know I will receive pushback from members of my own faith community on this matter. I will be told I do not understand the true threat posed by Islam. I'll also be told I've been blinded to the truth by my immersion in the liberal world of academia. Too many Evangelicals have been convinced by opportunistic political and religious leaders that any acknowledgement or accommodation of Islam is a threat to Christianity itself. I disagree. If allowing others to freely practice their faith, if providing (special and excessive) accommodations to those of Islam and if refusing to use the levers of government to intimidate, harass or oppress minority faiths (the one faith determined to subjugate and dominate those of every other faith) is a threat to Christianity, we Christians have bigger problems than we know. 
If Christians want to have real influence on our society '” if we want to spread the good news of God's love '” we must reject the type of political religion promoted by Rep. Bennett and his ilk. We must stand with those of other faiths and affirm that, unlike some in the Oklahoma Legislature , we believe all people of faith are entitled to practice their religion freely without fear of official sanction. 'If you are concerned that there are some who wish to destroy the Christian faith, follow Christ's instructions: 'Love your enemies! Do good to those who hate you. Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who hurt you'¦You must be compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate.' ( Luke 6:27-36 ) (And we see how well that idea has worked out for Christians in the Middle East who are very close to becoming extinct because of the ethnic cleansing by the Muslim majority) RELATED STORIES/VIDEOS:

A Swedish MP has lashed out after it was revealed Muslim freeloaders posing as refugees would be allowed to jump ahead of Swedish families in the housing queue. NOT ANYMORE! UK Express Earlier this month Express.co.uk reported several councils in the Scandinavian country are prioritising the requests of asylum seekers ahead of their own citizens, with Muslim migrants given housing straight away, despite Swedes being placed on a huge waiting list. Now 20 accommodations in Klippan, in south Sweden, are being prepared for Muslim migrants after a new policy demanded all available apartments owned by the municipal property company be put aside for asylum seekers. The move has been criticised by Therese Borg, of the Swedish Democrats (SD) party, as she argued the Muslim invaders should be placed on the list and wait their turn. Ms Borg said asylum seekers urgently needed to be placed on the list alongside regular people because hardworking citizens risked growing resentful of the preferential treatment. She told Nyheteridag : 'You can see a lot of comments on Facebook. People are pissed off. 'There are a lot of teenagers living at home and who are looking for [a small apartment] to move into as it is a good place to start [building a life]. 'The small apartments are necessary for [the youth] moving out, but they are not offered them unless the newly arrivals decline to take the property.' Meanwhile aid workers helping migrants say they have been terrified by Muslim attacks which have left them too scared to leave their homes. The SD politician also said the council should start focusing on the migrants already living in the area, rather than focusing funds on asylum seekers who might arrive in the future. Lashing out against the Government and Migration Board, Ms Borg demanded they take responsibility for the migrants they have allowed into the country. Even worse, a lot of Swedish families are being kicked out of their homes in order to accommodate Muslim freeloaders: However, Bert-Inge Karlsson, of the Christian Democrats, blasted Ms Borg's comments as he insisted her portrayal of the situation was out-of-touch with reality. Mr Karlsson said: 'I [question] the way Theresa Borg has portrayed it as if we have an extraordinary housing crisis in the nation. How is it then possible for us to take in so incredibly many. 'She has returned to the kind of insinuation'¦ which suggests the entire world could be on its way here.' In March this year, Sweden passed a law requiring all municipalities accept and provide housing for migrants, allowing families and others on the waiting to be placed at the back of the queue. The turmoil nation, which has been plagued with increasing levels of violence and criminal activity , with three police officers quitting each day , is experiencing chronic housing shortages as a result of the country's generous asylum and migration policies over the last decade.

UK citizens and war heroes get cheap pre-fab houses while Muslim colonizers get taxpayer-funded luxurious council homes UK Ministers have been forced to put forward plans for pre-fabricated homes after 30,000 luxury council houses were handed out to unemployed illegal alien Muslim migrants. Migration Watch said the costs will continue to rocket if a 'sustainable' level of migration is not achieved. UK Daily Mail More than 11,000 households are raking in benefits that are at least the equivalent of a higher rate taxpayers' Â£47,000 salary, it was revealed last month. According to official figures, thousands of Muslim migrant families on benefits are living in luxury homes, with many receiving housing handouts of about Â£5,000 per month '“ enough to fund a Â£1million mortgage. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Many taxpayers struggling to make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are drawing more in benefits than they've ever actually earned themselves. UK Express (h/t Rob E) A spokesperson said: 'There is a long standing controversy over the granting of social housing to immigrants. This has not been helped by local authorities' reluctance to publish the relevant information. 'Some immigrant groups have very low use of social housing whereas others are more likely to be in social housing than the UK born. There is absolutely nothing in the rules that state that immigrants should get preferential treatment. 'However, priority for social housing is largely determined by need and so some 'high need' immigrant families (with multiple wives and large litters of kids) will gain access to housing over longer standing local residents deemed to be of lower need. This can be contentious. The 100,000 pre-fab homes(below) proposed by the Government are a far cry from those properties 'fit for heroes' and service personnel who were awarded social housing on their return from the horrors of the First World War. 'In the future, any housing strategy must address both supply and demand. The Muslim invasion is a major part of housing demand. 'Unless net migration is reduced to a manageable and sustainable level a large house building programme will have to continue indefinitely, with all the costs and loss of amenities involved.' A white paper due out next month includes measures to encourage banks to lend to firms which construct off-site before delivering them to their final destination. A Government source said: 'The first and most obvious advantage is speeding up the building of housing. 'There is pretty good evidence that if you did it at scale it is cheaper.' This has pushed ministers to plan a new wave of pre-made homes to solve the housing crisis. The prefabricated homes can be built off site in as little as a day and take just 48 hours to install on a site. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Many taxpayers struggling to make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are drawing more in benefits than they've ever actually earned themselves. But today when approximately 9,000 of our servicemen and women are sleeping rough after leaving the military, Government figures show how an influx of Muslims has seen 30,000 social housing lettings given to immigrants in 2015. Outrage as Afghan War hero who guarded the Queen is thrown out of council home From 2015, Jamie Streets, 34, spent 15 years in the Household Cavalry and suffered brain damage while on duty. But he, his wife Charmaine and their four children are to be kicked out of temporary accommodation after Cornwall County Council denied them a permanent home. Mr Streets served in both Kosovo and Afghanistan and escorted the Queen on ceremonial duty, holding the rank of corporal of horse. But he was discharged on medical grounds last year after suffering serious head injuries and a brain tumor. Although he recovered enough to return to work, he then suffered a seizure and had to leave the Army. Sorry, we decided that unemployed Muslim colonizers deserve a nicer home than war heroes In an open letter to the Prime Minister and Cornwall Council's chief executive Andrew Kerr, the Household Cavalry Veterans Association says it is 'incensed'. Signed by Secretary Rob Mather, the letter claims taxpayers' money is spent on 'lavish lifestyles and foreign aid', while 'serious issues on our own doorstep are not resolved'. 'This is not acceptable treatment of one who served his Queen and country.' The seven-bedroom home in Acton, West London, where an Afghan Muslim family were placed at a cost of Â£2,875 a week to taxpayers UK: Muslim Welfare 'Refugees' Trash The Â£1.25 Million Home They Are Living In For Free And Laugh About It A family of PALESTINIAN MUSLIM freeloaders provoked outrage yesterday by saying they 'deserve' to live in a Â£1.25 million taxpayer-funded luxury home (above) despite trashing it. The mother, Mrs Mahmoud, gets Â£20,000 a year in housing benefits to pay her rent. Yet she said: 'I don't care if people think I am not grateful. I am entitled to live in a house like this even if I don't pay for it. 'I deserve to live in a nice house and get benefits because I am human.' The family is one of at least 100 unemployed Muslim invaders living in homes on state handouts that could fund Â£1million mortgages. Muslim mother of eight was placed in a Â£2.6m house in Notting Hill, west London at the taxpayers' expense She has since split with her husband and was given British citizenship five years ago but has never worked in this country. She moved with her two sons and five daughters to the three-bedroom house in Fulham, west London, three years ago. It had just undergone a Â£76,000 refurbishment, half paid for by the taxpayer. She claims her family is being persecuted because neighbours 'don't want a foreigner to come and live in this street.' Thanks for the nice council house, suckers. Migration Watch said the costs will continue to rocket if a 'sustainable' level of migration is not achieved.

ITALIAN MAYOR blasted for scathing verbal attack on African Muslim savages who have been invading Southern Italy Yes, his words may be racist and anti-Muslim, but look at the videos below to see what African Muslim illegal alien invaders are bringing to Italy and you won't be so quick to condemn him. What would you say if they did the same thing in your cities? Thousands of Muslims lift their asses to Allah in front of the Coliseum in Rome to protest the government's closing of hundreds of illegal mosques UK Express (h/t Brenda K) An Italian mayor has come under fire after saying he will shoot 'niggers and gypsies' and build a pig farm next to mosques as tensions continue to rise over the illegal alien Muslim invasion of southern Italy. More than 160,000 economic freeloaders posing as asylum seekers have been housed in Italy since the start of 2014, according to date from the interior ministry. Italy has been one of the first destinations along migrants typical routes for months, receiving thousands of new arrivals who continue to risk their lives to cross the Mediterranean on rickety smuggler's boats. But many have been critical of the welcoming of so many refugees '“ and now one Mayor from the town of Albettone in Vento has launched a scathing attack on the new arrivals. Speaking on La Zanzara on Radio 24, Joe Formaggio said: 'Immigrants? If they send them to us, we will protect our houses. We are proud to be racists.' The mayor claims his city 'exports brains and imports niggers' who 'are less intelligent than us, they are inferior'. Amid possible plans to open a mosque in the city, he claimed he would open a 'large farm of pigs if they open a mosque here'. Mr Formaggio added: 'If refugees are sent here to Albettone, the barricades in Gorino will be seen as nothing. 'Here we do not want immigrants, niggers or gypsies. They have a lower IQ: history proves it. 'We have a shooting range and the highest number of licenses to carry weapons in the whole Veneto region. 'And we do not want anyone to come and bother us. They risk their lives around us.' The comments were deemed so strong that the Secretary General of the Vicenza Chamber has been forced to intervene. Calling the comments 'irresponsible', Giampaolo Zanni said: 'The Chamber of Vicenza totally rejects the Mayor of Albetton's statements about the black population. 'None of us underestimates the problems arising from illegal alien Muslim invasion migration. 'But responses like those of the Mayor of Albettone are not only xenophobic and racist, but are also dangerous as they encourage feelings of racial hatred, and therefore are in stark contrast to the values of our constitution.' Thousands of Italians have come out in large protests against the never-ending Muslim invasion of their country.

BNI Store Nov 2 2016 ARIZONA Charter School teacher accused of harassment and assault of Somali Muslim student just because he is a Muslim Does anyone else smell the stench of designated terrorist group CAIR lurking in the shadows? A sixth grade teacher at the Academy of Excellence, a public charter school in Phoenix, allegedly said to a Muslim student: 'You're a terrorist. I can't wait until Trump is elected. He's going to deport you all.' The ACLU has since filed complaints with the Obama Departments of Justice and Education. ABC15 The American Civil Liberties Union says a Somali Muslim immigrant and his sister were expelled from a Phoenix school after a sixth grade teacher allegedly discriminated against him. The complaints were made against Academy of Excellence Charter School, a public charter school in Phoenix. According to a letter sent to both state agencies, the 11-year-old student allegedly was targeted by his sixth grade teacher multiple times during the 2015-2016 school year. The letter accuses the teacher of singling out the student because of his religion and/or nationality. On one occasion, the teacher allegedly showed a video about the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks. The teacher is accused of then telling the student 'That's going to be you,' suggesting that he was to become a terrorist himself, ACLU attorney Heather Weaver said. Earlier in the school year, the same teacher had refused to let A.A. pray during class one day , and is also accused of grabbing the student by his neck and choking him because he would not stop talking with his classmates'Š. The letter said that, during a separate incident in which the teacher was speaking about Donald Trump, she turned to the student and said, 'I can't wait until Trump is elected. He's going to deport all you Muslims. Muslims shouldn't be given visas. They'll probably take away your visa and deport you. You're going to be the next terrorist, I bet.' Because of the teacher's comments claimed by the ACLU, the student allegedly was teased by classmates on the bus ride home that day and was accused of plotting to blow up the bus, calling him a 'terrorist.' She then allegedly threatened the student, saying 'If you tell your mom (about the abuse), watch what happens next.' The ACLU said that when the alleged victim's mom complained to the school, the school director sided with the teacher, stating that she had done nothing wrong. The student was accused of breaking school rules by opening an emergency window while riding on the bus. As a result, both he and his sister '“ a second grader at the same school '“ were expelled; effective immediately. The complaints against the teacher were't lodged until after the students' expulsion from the school. The Academy of Excellence Charter School is refuting the claims. They've since released a statement regarding the situation, calling the allegations false. 'The Academy of Excellence Charter School Governing Board and Administration ('AOE') refutes the allegations contained in two letters from the ACLU. Those letters, both of which are dated October 28, 2016, are devoid of any evidence and contain false and unsubstantiated allegations. AOE conducted an internal investigation on January 25, 2016. That investigation produced no evidence to support the claims now being made . Additionally, these allegations were investigated by the Phoenix Police Department but at that time, her only complaint was that 'she believed that her children were kicked out of our school due to their Muslim faith.' AOE has many children who practice the Muslim faith. It was not until February 24, 2016, that the mother and her son made the allegation of 'choking.' This allegation was investigated by a Detective who found that, 'At the conclusion of the investigation, a crime in this matter was unfounded. Both suspect and witnesses provided corroborating statements, and were not consistent with the victims' statement.' This is the 'cursory and inadequate' investigation the ACLU notes in the footnotes to its letters. Finally, if you compare the timing of events contained in the ACLU's letters and the statements made to the Police by the teacher and the student, they are completely different. The difference between the statements calls into question the motive of the plaintif. AOE's first contact from the ACLU sought a substantial monetary payment.' (DING DING DING! It's always about the money) See more 'victim jihad' in public schools: ISLAMIZATION OF SCHOOLS

BNI Store Nov 2 2016 'WE'VE HAD ENOUGH!' Italian Prime Minister threatens to cripple the EU unless it stops mass Muslim migration FURIOUS Italian leader Matteo Renzi today threatened to fatally cripple the entire European Union project unless Brussels bureaucrats do something about ending the Muslim invasion. UK Express In an extraordinary threat the apoplectic PM vowed to veto the EU budget and starve Brussels of taxpayers' cash, inducing complete paralysis, if the refugee chaos is not fixed by the end of this year. A visibly angry Mr Renzi warned that Italy 'cannot survive' another influx of migrants in 2017 similar to the one it faced this year and blasted Europe's 'inability to show solidarity' on the issue. His remarkable threat marks another ratcheting up of the growing tensions between Rome and Brussels, whose friendship has been stretched to breaking point by the migration crisis. Italy has become the focal point for millions of migrants and refugees hoping to reach Europe ever since the route to Greece was effectively cut off by a repatriation deal with Turkey. More than 155,000 Muslim freeloaders posing as asylum seekers have arrived in the country this year alone after crossing the Mediterranean from Libya on rickety smugglers' boats. But Austria, Switzerland and France to the north have shored up their borders meaning almost all of those have become trapped in Italy, placing a huge strain on services and local communities. Speaking to the talk show Porta a Porta last night, Mr Renzi blasted: 'Either we block the influx by 2017 or Italy will not handle another year like the past year.' And he warned: 'Right now we can manage it. Winter is coming and sea conditions will worsen, but we have six months maximum.' Mr Renzi also strongly hinted that he will veto the EU budget in retaliation for the critical situation unless Brussels steps in and forces member states to take in their fair share of migrants. He blasted: 'If the Eastern countries who are growing with the help of our money do not open their doors to migrants as has been agreed, then we'll put a veto on the future European budget.' An EU Commission to impose migrant quotas on countries has run into difficulty following furious opposition from eastern European countries and a less than enthusiastic response from others already struggling with the pressures of mass migration. A number of member states including Hungary, which recently held a referendum where 98 per cent of voters rejected migrant quotas, are even taking legal proceedings against the EU in a bid to hold up the scheme. And Italy's interior minister, Angelino Alfano, backed up Mr Renzi's extraordinary ultimatum to veto the EU budget and withhold funds from Brussels unless it resolves the impasse. He said: 'We must use the veto. We give our money so that, in exchange for these duties, the others honour their commitments. 'Money does not go through walls. You know what? If they don't help us, we will not give more money.' Referring to the country's net budget contribution under its former leader, the technocrat Mario Monti, he added: 'The Monti government determined that we give 20 billion [euros] and receive 12, but if Hungary and Slovakia give us moral lessons about our money and then refuse to give us a hand on migrants, that doesn't work.'

BNI Store Nov 2 2016 BREAKING BOMBSHELL: NYPD blows whistle on new Hillary emails: Money Laundering, Pay to Play, Perjury, Sex Crimes with Children, Child Exploitation New York Police Department (NYPD) detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner have turned over a newly-found laptop he shared with wife Huma Abedin to the FBI with enough evidence 'to put Hillary (Clinton) and her crew away for life,' NYPD sources said. TruePundit NYPD sources said Clinton's 'crew' also included several unnamed yet implicated members of Congress in addition to her aides and insiders. The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday. But new revelations on the contents of that laptop, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said. NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to: Money laundering Sex crimes with minors (children) Perjury Pay to play through Clinton Foundation Obstruction of justice Other felony crimes NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the department's highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices. 'What's in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,' the NYPD Chief said. 'There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.' The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton. 'People are going to prison,' he said. Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said. 'If they don't cooperate they are going to see long sentences,' a federal law enforcement source said. The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epstein's island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries. Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein's guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island.

BNI Store Nov 2 2016 'We are losing control of the streets,' say police as Angela Merkel's Germany descends into chaos and lawlessness GERMAN Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing catastrophe over her failed mass Muslim migration policy, according to a new report. Germany has been hit by a tidal wave of horrendous violent crime including rapes, sexual and physical assaults, stabbings, home invasions, robberies, burglaries and drug trafficking'¦not to mention Islamic terrorist attacks. UK Express Adding to the country's woes is the fact that thousands of people have gone missing after travelling there on invitation from Anegla Merkel. Germany took in more than 1.1million migrants in the past year and parts of the country are crippled with a lack of infrastructure. Now the true reality is hitting home ahead of next year's elections as the far right surges in the polls threatening to topple the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Mrs Merkel. According to a report by the international policy council the Gatestone Institute, local police in many parts of the country admit that they are stretched to the limit. Despite the mayhem caused by skyrocketing violent crime and terror attacks by Muslim migrants, German officials insist on blaming the unrest on the rise of the 'far right extremists' (aka German patriots). The report states: 'The rape of a ten-year-old girl in Leipzig, the largest city in Saxony, has drawn renewed attention to the spiralling levels of violent crime perpetrated by migrants in cities and towns across Germany. 'Thousands of migrants who entered the country as 'asylum seekers' or 'refugees' have gone missing. They are, presumably, economic migrants who entered Germany on false pretences. 'Many are thought to be engaging in robbery and criminal violence.' According to Freddi Lohse of the German Police Union in Hamburg, many migrant offenders view the leniency of the German justice system as a green light to continue delinquent behaviour, says the report. He said: 'They are used to tougher consequences in their home countries. 'They have no respect for us.' After the 'refugee' disaster that Angela Merkel has created, she is now unsettled about Europe returning to nationalism. Nationalism is a nightmare for all the liberal leaders working for a New World Order. 'During the first six months of 2016, Muslim migrants committed 142,500 crimes , according to the Federal Criminal Police Office. This is equivalent to 780 crimes committed by migrants every day, an increase of nearly 40 per cent over 2015. The data includes only those crimes in which a suspect has been caught. Muslim migrants committed 208,344 crimes in 2015 , according to a confidential police report leaked to Bild. This figure represents an 80 per cent increase since 2014 and is equivalent to 570 crimes committed by migrants every day, or 23 crimes each hour, in 2015 alone. 'Nearly 70 per cent of respondents said they fear for their lives and property in German train stations and subways, while 63 per cent feel unsafe at large public events.' The report added: 'The growing sense of lawlessness is substantiated by an October 24 YouGov poll which found that 68 per cent of Germans believe that security in the country has deteriorated during the past several years. Germans are taking to the streets in the thousands in weekly protests against the Muslim invasion started by the Obama/Soros/Clinton Arab Spring and aided and abetted by Angela Merkel. Meanwhile a female police officer has admitted that officers are under attack and that the courts are a 'joke.' In a new book, Tania Kambouri, a German police officer, said: 'For weeks, months and years I have noticed that Muslims, mostly young men, do not have even a minimum level of respect for the police. 'When we are out patrolling the streets, we are verbally abused by young Muslims. 'There is the body language, and insults like 's*** cop' when passing by. 'If we make a traffic stop, the aggression increases ever further, this is overwhelmingly the case with migrants. 'It cannot be that offenders continue to fill the police files, hurt us physically, insult us, whatever, and there are no consequences. 'Many cases are closed or offenders are released on probation or whatever. 'Yes, what is happening in the courts today is a joke.' The construction of a small mosque, the first in the German state of Thuringia, created controversy after the Alternative for Germany party labeled it a 'land grab project' and announced a massive anti-Islam rally.

FLORIDA: Designated Terrorist Group CAIR demands 'hate crime' investigation of anti-Islam graffiti on mosque, blames Trump The entrance sign at the Al Amin Islamic Center in Boynton Beach was spray-painted with graffiti containing anti-Islamic and anti- Islamic terrorist messages. ABC News The Palm Beach Sheriff's Office said deputies responded to a report of vandalism this morning, and that it occurred sometime after midnight and was captured on surveillance video.

BNI Store Nov 2 2016 IN BRITAIN, Paki Muslim sex traffickers who rape and pimp out young white children go free but Christians who throw bacon at a mosque get thrown in jail Two British men have been jailed for going to a mosque and throwing bacon at a Muslim man in what the sharia-compliant British officials call a 'callous hate crime.' There you go, Londoners, keep on electing Muslim politicians and soon you'll be stoned to death for insulting Islam. Metro Piotr Czak-Zukowski was found with an empty packet of bacon in his pocket when he was searched by police officers after the incident. He and Mateusz Pawlikowski had confronted worshippers at the Al-Rahman Mosque in Crowndale Road, Kings Cross, north London on October 2. BACON BANDITS Mateusz Pawlikowski and Piotr Czak-Zukowski Pawlikowski, 22, of Wilton Road, in Muswell Hill, north London, swore at a man and threw a rasher of bacon towards him, and chucked more bacon on the floor of the prayer room. The pair fled but Pawlikowski was detained near the mosque and Czak-Zukowski, 28, of Sneath Avenue, in Brent Cross, north London, was found at Camden Lock. Both men admitted criminal damage and a religiously aggravated public order offence last month. They were jailed for eight months at Blackfriars Crown Court. DC Tracey McMath, from the Camden Community Safety Unit, said: 'The defendants showed a complete disregard for the faith and belief of others in this callous and highly offensive incident; and I hope their convictions highlight that we will not tolerate hate crime in any form.

BNI Store Nov 2 2016 WHITE FLIGHT? Or is it white fright? British multiculturalism has created segregation in towns where the white population is fleeing as the Muslim population is exploding White and mainly Muslim minority groups are now more isolated from each other than ever before '“ while white populations in towns and cities have sunk to record lows '“ now less than 50% in the last decade alone, it has been revealed. UK Express In Newham, east London, just 16 per cent of the population are white compared to 33 per cent 10 years ago. And Blackburn has ranked as one of the most segregated town in Britain, where in the Whalley Range area 95 per cent of people are Muslim and a local butcher has admitted he has never served a white person in the whole of his time there. Mohammed Tabrez Noorji, who opened his halal butcher shop last year, said: 'I do sometimes speak to the white people when they walk past but there is nothing for them to buy here. 'It is not good that we all live separately but how can we fix this problem? Muslim families like to live in the same area as each other so we can support one another, but then the white people move out. 'It's not that we deliberately choose to live separately '“ it is just what happens. We want to live in this area because we are close to the mosques and all our families are very close to each other.' And experts warn matters will increase in the same direction. Academic Ted Cantle, a Government advisor on community adhesion, has warned the 2021 census will reveal polarisation has got even greater. The research, published by Open Democracy, calls on the Government to do more to promote mixed communities. The calls have been made particularly relevant in light of the spike in hate crime reported since the Brexit referendum on June 23. But not everyone wants 'community adhesion' to be encouraged. Retired taxi driver Ian Goodliffe, who previously worked at a 'white only' taxi firm, said: 'There are certain areas where white people no longer go and the same for Muslims. They lead very separate lives. 'There is an element of fear on both sides and then there is of course this awful racism. I hear it all the time. 'It is sometimes a gang mentality and everyone wants to stick to their own. There are whole parts of Blackburn where a white person would not buy a house but then there is the same for the Muslims. 'There is a mutual distrust and the only way to change that is for people to mix, but we are at a total impasse and it is only going to get worse.' Professor Cantle also said he met a Yorkshireman who said he was the first Muslim to move into a street and within three years all the white families had gone. He said: ' Some of those families made no bones about it '“ they are moving out because 'they' are moving in.' The study, conducted by integration experts Professor Cantle and Professor Eric Kaufman, has revealed that white and minority groups are now more isolated from each other than ever before '“ even though England as a whole is more ethnically mixed. Polarization mainly occurs in urban areas, with some places in the UK seeing a decrease in the white population of more than 50 per cent between 1991 and 2011. Towns and cities, such as Birmingham, Leicester, Slough, Luton, Bradford and London have seen the 'striking' decrease occur more rapidly than other parts of the UK, it has been claimed. P rofessor Cantle said: 'The focus of policy needs to shift, this is not just about minorities. 'Politicians and policy-makers need to encourage white British residents to remain in diverse areas. 'To choose, rather than avoid, diverse areas when they do re-locate, encouraging similar choices with respect to placing pupils in diverse schools. 'In other words to create a positive choice for mixed areas and a shared society.' The study comes as the Government is about to deliver a major review into integration, segregation and extremism. Labour's Chuka Umunna, chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration, said: 'During a year in which our country has seemed more divided than at any point in modern history, there are few questions which require investigation more urgently than the matter of how well we are living together. 'Equally, however '“ at a time in which our political debate has become yet more polarized and media headlines yet more fraught '“ there are few questions which it can seem harder to get to the bottom of. 'It's clear that, whilst the UK is becoming increasingly diverse, levels of integration are not keeping pace.'

FBI Sources believe Clinton Foundation case is 'likely moving toward an indictment' Fox News Channel's Bret Baier reports the latest news about the Clinton Foundation investigation from two sources inside the FBI. He reveals five important new pieces of information: 1. The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year. 2. The laptops of Clinton aides Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them. The investigation has interviewed several people twice, and plans to interview some for a third time. 3. Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clinton's secret server on Anthony Weiner's laptop. They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature. 4. Sources within the FBI have told him that an indictment is 'likely' in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation, 'barring some obstruction in some way' from the Justice Department. 5. FBI sources say with 99% accuracy that Hillary Clinton's server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that information had been taken from it.

Apparently, Donald Trump has already activated the 'reset button' with Russia And this is why Hillary Clinton never could. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed his bewilderment at why European countries were taking in so many migrants given the increasing number of rapes sweeping the continent, asserting that a society which cannot protect its children 'has no future'. Putin made reference to a story out of Austria where an Iraqi migrant was not punished for raping a 10-year-old boy at a swimming pool in Vienna after he claimed it was a 'sexual emergency' and that he didn't understand the boy didn't want to be raped. 'I can't even explain the rationale '“ is it a sense of guilt before the illegal alien Muslim migrants? A society that cannot defend its children today has no tomorrow, it has no future,' warned Putin, adding that he would not look to Europe for advice on Russia's immigration policy given the situation that is unfolding there.

PARIS: After destruction begins on their squatters camps, Muslim illegals scream that they are 'humans, not beasts' But nobody is buying it. Illegal alien Muslim invaders have staged a mass protest in Paris over their treatment by French authorities following destruction of their makeshift camps. Masses of Muslim freeloaders sleeping in the streets joined local bleeding hearts to demonstrate at their encampment near the Stalingrad Metro station. UK Daily Mail (h/t therezam) One man held up a sign saying 'human, no beast' as a man used a loud speaker to lead the march, which happened late last night. It came 24 hours after violence broke out at the site with gangs of men attacking each other using sticks as makeshift clubs. The fighting unfolded just hours after demolition workers supported by riot police began smashing up an illegal camp full of UK-bound migrants in Paris. It also came in the wake of the destruction of the Calais Jungle which saw refugees transported around the country. It is not yet known what caused the fight in Paris. There had already been scuffles on Monday as mainly Afghans and Eritreans tried to save their possessions during the raid, which started soon after 8am. It followed thousands of Muslim freeloaders arriving in the French capital following the razing of the Calais Jungle refugee camp last week. While some 5000 Jungle residents agreed to be bused to resettlement centres around France, many others headed off independently, saying they still wanted to get to Britain. Up to 3000 set up tents on the pavements around the Stalingrad Metro station, which is close to the Gare du Nord Eurostar hub in the north of Paris. Shortly before Monday's clearance French president Francois Hollande said: 'We won't tolerate the camps any longer.' Referring to the Paris clearance, Mr Hollande said: 'We are going to carry out the same operation as in Calais.' CRS riot police around Stalingrad said there would be a 'gradual operation' which is likely to go on all week until all the camps are gone.

Very concerned about Islam-sanctioned persecution of gays by Muslim, gays come out in force for Trump Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump kicked off a marathon day of campaigning with a speech to over 4,000 supporters at the Jacksonville Equestrian Center on Thursday. And John LaBarbera and Craig Starling, wearing rainbow 'Gays for Trump' T-shirts, made sure they were there. Breitbart 'We're concerned about the possibility of Musilm terrorism and anti-gay violence such as the deadly attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando,' Starling told Breitbart News. 'Trump is better on security and immigration.' LaBarbera, who drove with Starling from Savannah, Georgia, to attend the rally, agreed, adding that he also preferred Trump's economic policies. He said that he had lost several yard signs to theft, and had endured hate on Facebook. But he added that people at Savannah's gay pride rally had been 'kind' when they set up a booth for Trump, and that Trump fans at the rally had been 'supportive' as well. Other 'Gays for Trump' signs have been popping up at Trump rallies elsewhere in the Sunshine State. One supporter waved a homemade sign at Trump's rally in Orlando on Wednesday. And Trump emerged onstage in Colorado on Sunday holding a rainbow flag with the words 'LGBTs for Trump' written on it. More and more gays are supporting Donald Trump.

GERMANY: Christian priest gets stoned by illegal alien Muslim children shouting 'Allahu Akbar' The Ethiopian vicar was visiting the town of Raunheim on the outskirts of Frankfurt when the pre-teens started throwing stones at him. The three Muslim children, aged between 10 and 12-years-old, shouted 'Allahu Akhbar' as they threw the stones, the other priest who was visiting from a nearby church said. UK Express Dressed in traditional priest's gear and wearing a cross around his neck, the 47-year-old was walking to the Russian Orthodox chapel in Frankfurter StraÃŸe with a local priest, who wished to remain anonymous, when he was attacked. Both priests tried to take photos of the children with their mobile phones, but the youngsters were too quick and managed to escape. Raunheim social worker Dr Isack Majura said he was going to do everything possible to get hold of the children. He said: 'What happened is absolutely unacceptable.' (Get used to it) There have been a number of news reports of Christians facing attacks by Muslims at German camps, such as a case from October 2015 where a convert to Christianity was reportedly beaten unconscious with a baton by Muslim refugees at a camp in Hamburg-Eidelstedt. For example, a report earlier this year revealed that there had been no less than 743 reported attacks by Muslims upon Christians in invader centers in Germany. Yesterday, Express.co.uk revealed pupils at a girl's primary school in the German ski resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen are being forced to chant 'Allahu Akhbar' and 'there is no God but Allah.' A father of a pupil claimed his daughter had been 'forced' by teachers to memorize the Islamic chants. Weeks before, parents complained their children's nursery was refusing to acknowledge 'Christmas rituals' such as putting up a Christmas tree or singing carols to accommodate the 'diverse (Muslim) cultures' of other pupils. In Germany, Christian refugees have to be separated from Muslim refugees because they are being peesecuted by the Muslims in the asylum centers.

BNI Store Nov 4 2016 Wife of Muslim jihadist who killed and wounded over 100 in Orlando nightclub massacre says she 'knew nothing' 'I was unaware of everything,' says Omar Mateen's wife, 30-year-old Noor Salman (whose whereabouts were a matter of controversy for some time after the massacre), has given her first interview since the Pulse Nightclub massacre to the New York Times. The New York Times piece does not go into detail about her movements since the FBI seemingly lost track of her, although it suggests she is still a person of interest to law enforcement. Her lawyers pop up early in the article to insist she 'did nothing wrong' and to forbid questions about her discussions with federal agents. Salman said she had no idea what Mateen was up to on the day of the attack. She knew her husband watched jihadist videos, but she did not think much of it. But how could she have not suspected what her husband was planning '“ she knew he had the weapons, she drove him to the nightclub and dropped him off: Noor Salman, wife of Orlando shooter Omar Mateen, had all the hallmarks of a willing accomplice to her husband's jihadist slaughter. Georgia State University professor Mia Bloom told The Times that studies show relatives and friends are aware of budding terrorist activities about 64% of the time and argued that Mateen's abusive relationship with Salman 'doesn't give her a free pass as a bystander to not come forward.' Salman insists she had no dark suspicions about several trips she took with Mateen that have been viewed as preparation for his terrorist career, although the lawyers notably intervened to prevent her from discussing the most notorious of these incidents '“ the April 2015 trip to Disneyworld that Mateen may have used to case the park for an attack. Salman did nothing to warn the police of her husband's intentions. When the FBI first questioned Salman, she admitted to bringing Mateen ammunition and a holster. The piece describes her as 'shattered and afraid,' to the point that she sometimes has trouble getting out of bed. (Awww'¦I bet those 49 people her husband slaughtered in cold blood in Orlando would love to have that problem)

BNI Store Nov 4 2016 'MODERATE' INDONESIA: Protest against a Christian governor turns violent as more than 100,000 Muslims demand death for Christian governor who 'blasphemed' Islam JARKARTA: The biggest street protest in years shook this sprawling capital today in a stark display of the more conservative, militant strain of Islam taking hold in the world's largest Muslim country. ( Which Hillary Clinton has called a 'shining example of a 'moderate' Islamic country' ) WSJ Police said an estimated 100,000 people turned out for a rally called by hard-line Muslim groups against the capital's Christian governor, whom they accuse of having committed blasphemy. Blasphemy is a criminal offense in Indonesia and prosecutions have increased in the past decade. President Joko Widodo had met with other political leaders amid calls for calm, but critics say he has been too slow since taking office in 2014 to respond to worsening tension for fear of being labeled anti-Muslim. 'Religiosity is rising, especially among the middle class,' said Yon Machmudi, an Islamic politics expert at the University of Indonesia. 'A sense of identification is increasing.'' Protesters were taking aim at Basuki Tjahaha Purnama, known as Ahok, who is the most prominent politician among the country's often-persecuted, ethnic Chinese minority. He was elected deputy governor in 2012 and elevated to the top job in 2014 after his boss, Mr. Widodo, was elected president. Some hard-liners had tried to block his ascent then, saying Muslims shouldn't be ruled by a 'kafir,' or nonbeliever. Mr. Purnama, now running for re-election, angered the groups again by citing a verse of the Quran in a public address in late September. He has apologized and said he would cooperate with a police investigation, but has since been the target of protests. Vice President Jusuf Kalla met a group of protest leaders and said afterward that police would pursue a blasphemy case against Mr. Purnama. Nearly 90% of Indonesia's 250 million people are Muslim and are becoming more radical every year as seen by head scarves for women, once rare, are now widely worn and Islamic schools are expanding. A movement to ban alcohol is gaining steam and sales have been banned from convenience stores. Travel to Mecca for the minor pilgrimage of umrah, once a relatively uncommon undertaking for middle-class Indonesians, is newly popular. Security experts say the rising conservatism paves the way for potential violence , pointing to some religious hard-liners who have rebranded themselves as cells of Islamic State. 'What we've seen in the last 18 months to two years is increasing crossover from organizations that started out 'nonviolent but hard-line' to organizations which are now committed to using violence,' said Sidney Jones, director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict.

Because rightly or wrongly, people project their view of the world onto others.We live according to the golden rule and don't do to others that which we do not want them to.do to us. Many cannot fathom or conceive just how vile the followers of the murderous paedophile can be. It's incomprehensible. Even animals that have been traumatised and abused don't behave like that when rescued. Europeans have mostly been peaceful for the last 70 years because they made a concerted effort to live in peace and to uphold dignity of life and human rights. That came at a price. Followers of the paedophile savage are socialised differently. They are pathetic and emotionally infantile. In the West we are taught to take personal responsibility for our actions. They are taught to blame everyone but themselves often turning victims into the guilty in the case of raped women. In the West violent displays of anger are frowned upon and we are taught to apologise for our wrong doIngs. Muslims have a warped and messed up sense of honour. An honour they will gladly kill their families to restore. In short they accept everything that is a crime in our countries as somehow permissible. Incompatible. In the West they are given human rights they don't deserve and freedoms they can't handle. Proven recipe for disaster. You have to be very very naive to believe that people who are fed a steady diet of intolerance, opression and hatred since birth will miraculously change just because they cross a border from hell hole to civilsed country. It should be obvious by now that Muslims born in europe cannot be integrated so what hope do we have integrating the rest. Nicolai sennels wrote a great paper on why islam is prone to creating monsters. Puts it all into perspective and is a must read in my opinion.

MAINE GOVERNOR joins Kansas, Texas, and New Jersey in withdrawing from the federal (Muslim) refugee resettlement program Gov. Paul LePage is withdrawing the state of Maine from the federal refugee settlement program, citing a loss of confidence in its ability to safely and responsibly run the program. Maine has become one of the Obama Regime's favorite dumping grounds for unskilled, illiterate, welfare-dependant large Somali Muslim families. Obama doesn't need a religious test for refugees because most of them are Muslims WCSH6 (h/t kafir) In a letter Friday, Gov. LePage informed President Obama and notified the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) that Maine would no longer be participating in the program. 'The federal government has proven to be an unwilling partner with states in ensuring that refugee settlement does not unduly put American lives at risk,' LePage wrote. Maine joins Kansas, New Jersey and Texas in severing ties with the ORR. In the letter, LePage included the case of refugee Adnan Fazeli of Freeport, who was revealed in August through an FBI investigation to have died last year while fighting for the Islamic State. 'I sincerely hope that the federal government will re-evaluate its current refugee policy '” both the quantity and nation of origin of refugees it resettles and the vetting process they are subjected in '” in order to best protect the safety and interests of the American people,' LePage wrote. The typical size of Somali Muslim refugee families places an unfair burden on hardworking American taxpayers who must fund welfare for them According to LePage's office, the governor has directed the state Health and Human Services Department (DHHS) to work with federal counterparts to implement a transition out of the ORR program. The ORR was created after the passing of the 1980 Refugee Act, which provided the legal basis. By withdrawing from the federal program, LePage has removed state workers from the integration assistance process but has not stopped refugees from entering or living in Maine.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN being sued for humiliating Skittles candy by comparing it to Syrian Muslim infiltrators It was a campaign ad that ignited a firestorm: Donald Trump Jr. tweeted a photo of a bowl of skittles and compared the colorful candy to Syrian jihadists posing as refugees. Now, the man who took the photo is suing Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence for copyright infringement. Liberals accused the tweet of being insenstive, racist, and a micro-agression which forced them to seek shelter in the nearest safe room. CBC David Kittos, an expert photographer and former Cypriot refugee, says he never gave permission and never would give permission for his photo to be used in the ad. 'The image, the way it was used is reprehensible,' said Kittos from his home in Surrey, England, in an interview with CBC News. 'It's ignoring the plight of the refugees and it's completely unacceptable that someone who was born into privilege would steal my picture and use it to make this political point.' Kittos says when he first saw the tweet, he was 'in shock.' He explains he took the photo in 2010 as an experiment using artificial lighting and posted it on Flickr . 'I just couldn't believe my humble picture of some Skittles would just be used by someone so powerful.' Kittos says his lawyer reached out to the Trump campaign to discuss the matter but got no response. So he reported a copyright violation to Twitter, and about a week after it was posted his Skittles photo was removed from Trump Jr.'s tweet. Even though his photo is no longer connected to the ad, Kittos decided to file a lawsuit at a federal court in Illinois. He says he wants to ensure the Trump campaign never uses the work again. As well, he wants to spread the message that 'they can't go around stealing from authors like myself. They're not above the law.' The Trump campaign told CBC News it's not commenting on the case at this time. Back in September, Trump Jr. defended the tweet. 'I am surprised by the reaction simply because it is a metaphor for risk,' he said at a campaign stop in Boise, Idaho. Trump's election campaign has called for 'extreme vetting' of immigrants to the U.S., especially Muslims, to help weed out anyone who could be a danger to American citizens. While Trump's position is popular with some Americans, his eldest son's tweet ignited outrage on social media. 'Sorry kid. For all we know you could be a poisonous Skittle,' someone tweeted along with a well-known photo of an injured and bloodied young Syrian boy. 'The stupidity ensues,' commented another person. Even the Skittles owner, Mars, Inc., weighed in. 'Skittles are candy. Refugees are people,' tweeted Denise Young, vice-president of corporate affairs. Kittos is seeking yet to be determined damages as part of the lawsuit. But he says he's not in it for the money (sure he isn't) and would have settled a for a public apology. Because that didn't happen, he says he's pursuing the lawsuit because 'it's the right thing to do.'

BNI Store Nov 5 2016 Muslims regularly use 'Inshallah' ('God Willing' in Arabic) and nobody calls it 'Christophobic' hate speech'¦so why is 'Deus Vult' ('God Willing' in Latin) graffiti being called 'Islamophobic' Crusader hate speech? At the newly sharia-compliant University of Southern Maine, moronic school officials say 'Deus Vult' Graffiti of Crusades' rallying cry is being referred to the state Attorney General's office after the Latin phrase used by Christians was written on a desk and wall in a student government office. Press Herald The phrase was used as a rallying cry for Christians during the Crusades in medieval times, and more recently has now is being called an anti-Muslim insult. In an email to the campus community, USM President Glenn Cummings condemned the 'anti-Muslim graffiti' found in the office in the Woodbury Campus Center. 'I want you to know that addressing this is our highest priority. Our campus security is fully investigating what we believe to be a hate crime,' Cummings wrote. 'A team from our Dean of Students is working hard to uncover the facts while providing opportunities for intergroup dialogue and supporting students directly and indirectly affected by this reprehensible act. (It's free speech, you idiot, and Muslims use the exact same phrase everyday, especially when trying to impose their death cult on non-muslims) British member of ISIS Mostly, to our Muslim students I want to express how sorry I am this has happened. Please know that such actions affect all of us. This is not who USM is or wants to be.' (USM is a school of politically correct asswipes who should be fired) According to USM's student body president (a Muslim, of course) , Muhammad 'Humza' Khan, a male student who is not part of student government drew the graffiti Tuesday afternoon, while two student Senate members were in the office. Khan, who declined to identify the student because of the investigation, said the two witnesses have said they didn't understand the meaning of the phrase '“ which was written in small letters on an electrical wire cover on a wall, and on a wooden desk. USM officials also have not released the student's name. In a Facebook post, USM student body Vice President Matt Raymond condemned the graffiti. 'I just wanted to say that all this happened a day after five Muslim students asked for applications to Student Government to become Senators. I believe this act of 'criminal intimidation' (Seriously? You should be taken away in a straitjacket) to be linked to that fact,' Raymond wrote, adding that student government is open to all students of any race, gender, religion, sexuality, economic background or nationality.' (It is, but you can't blame students for hating Muslims, the biggest threat to America) Southwest Airlines knows what it means and acted accordingly Humza Khan, myself, and our Cabinet under the Executive branch condemn in the harshest terms this crime of bias and intimidation. Let's show folks that USM is a diverse and inclusive university for all moving forward!' A group of about 40 students rallied in support of Muslim students at lunchtime Thursday. Raymond said he plans to ask the student Senate to vote out two members who he believes did not respond appropriately to the incident. Khan said he believes the person who wrote the graffiti intended to intimidate Muslim students who have expressed interest in joining the student Senate. 'The way Muslims see (that Latin phrase,) we see it indirectly as 'Let's kill Muslims,' ' said Khan, who is Muslim. (But Muslim students who keep saying Death to Israel/Death to America are said to be exercising their freedom of speech) 'It's not immediately seen as racist, it's not a racial epithet, but it's still there to intimidate a specific group of people,' Raymond said. 'And it served its purpose, even though it was coded language.' (One can only hope. Muslims should be banned from holding office anywhere America. Look at the mess the Muslim in the White House has made)

Why did the Toronto Police Force hire a Saudi-born radical Islamic fundamentalist as a Muslim chaplain? MUSLEH KHAN: Born in Saudi Arabia, Khan now lectures in Toronto's Muslim community on subjects like Islamic Law and marriage. On October 26th of this year, Khan was officially appointed Muslim Chaplain for The Toronto Police. Among Khan's radical beliefs: ' A woman should ask her husband permission before leaving the home'¦ she should take care to seek permission from her husband before going out of the home that he has provided her . ' The Muslim prophet Mohammed's marriage to a nine-year-old is somehow instructive. Khan says puberty is the right time to get married (and, if that occurs when a girl is 9, so be it) '” and, don't forget, according to Khan, married women are forbidden from withholding sex from their husbands, even if they want to play with their Barbie dolls instead.

ALL IN'¦IN THE HOOD'¦for Donald Trump! Donald Trump is on track to win more of the African-American vote than any other Republican in modern memory, said John Yob, CEO of a Michigan-based polling firm, Strategic National . And that's why Barack Hussein Obama is running around campaigning so hard against him for Hillary. While that so-called 'racist' Donald Trump along with Rosa Parks and Muhammad Ali, were receiving the Ellis Island Medal of Honor from the National Ethnic Coalition Organization'¦ '¦Hillary Clinton was singing the praises of Democrat Senator Robert Byrd, former leader in the Ku Klux Klan before becoming a U.S. Senator. Breitbart On Friday, a poll of 506 Pennsylvania voters by Harper Polling showed Trump has the support of 18.46 percent of African-Americans. An Oct. 30 poll of 1,249 likely voters in Pennsylvania showed Trump has 19 percent support among African Americans, while another 7 percent remain undecided. That poll has a error margin of 2.77 percent. In next-door Michigan, two nights of a tracking poll conducted for Fox 2 of 1,150 likely voters showed Trump with 14 percent support and 19 percent support. That's equivalent to a two-point shift from Clinton to Trump in the state. Trump is gaining in Michigan partly because many African-American voters '” especially younger voters who backed Sen. Bernie Saunders '” distrust Clinton, said W ayne Bradley, state director of African-American engagement for the Michigan Republican Party. That distrust has helped cause a sharp drop in the number of absentee ballots mailed in from Detroit, even as other part of the state send in more ballots that before, Bradley said. Faced with a low turnout, the Clinton campaign is trying to frighten African-Americans to vote, but 't hat's not a convincing enough argument,' he said. Trump's gain among African-American voters is happening in many states, alongside an overall reduction in African-American enthusiasm and support for Obama's designated successor. That drop-off in support from Obama's 93 percent level will likely reduce the turnout for Clinton. That's a problem for Democrats, because a 7.5 percent drop in nationwide African-American turnout would be equal to a one-point drop in a nationwide vote for Clinton. Reports say the early-voting turnout by Africans Americans has dropped by up to 10 percent in North Carolina and by somewhat less in Florida . President Barack Obama and other top Democrats have hopscotched through the states to push that turnout back up by election day. But pollsters face problems when trying to gauge opinions in a high-stakes emotional competition. Some concerned people lie to pollsters. For example, roughly 7 percent of college grads hide their support for Trump when they're ask by pollsters over the phone, perhaps out of fear of penalties if their choice was made public. So when polls show a non-answer from respondents, for example, many undecided voters, the votes may be hiding a weak or strong preference for Trump. These factor may be impacting polls of African-Americans, who are being hammered by claims from Clinton and Obama that Trump is supposedly a racist. 'If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers '” the Klan '” and hesitate when asked about that support, then you'll tolerate that support when you're in office,' Obama told an African-American crowd in North Carolina on Nov. 3. (See above for Hillary's support of the KKK) A national poll by TIPP showed Clinton at only 75 percent support among all non-whites, including Hispanics, African-Americans and Latinos. That poll showed Trump getting support from 15 percent of non-whites , leaving 5 percent undecided and 5 percent supporting other candidates. Amid the disagreement, rivalries and complexity, Bradley is confident that Trump will do well among African-Americans. His final tally as the GOP candidate 'will be a higher number that it has been in the past'¦ [because] he's working, he's coming to these cities to deliver the message.' The African-American vote may even be enough to help push Trump over the so-called 'blue wall' of Democratic northern states that stands in his path to the White House. Some say Trump is likely to get 16-25% of Black vote.

BNI Store Nov 5 2016 MINNESOTASTAN: Tagging the Muslim Student Association (MSA) sign with 'ISIS' is NOT a hate crime but an accurate description of what the MSA stands for The discovery of ISIS graffiti on the MSA sign at the University of Minnesota campus has the local chapter of designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) calling for a hate crime investigation. CAIR-MN says that 'Islamophobic' vandals spray-painted 'ISIS' on the Muslim Student Association's sign on campus. However, if you are familiar with the background of the MSA, it's easy to understand why ISIS is an appropriate tag for them. MSA, like CAIR, is a North American affiliate of the terror-linked Muslim Brotherhood organization (original founders of al-Qaeda), whose headquarters, originally in Egypt (from which it has been banned by the al-Sisi government for its terrorist activities) now is in Qatar, a well-known state sponsor of terrorism, including the Islamic State (ISIS). FOX9 Naturally, the CAIR thugs think you are too ignorant to know this, so they perform their usual 'Islamophobia' tap dance, demanding yet another time-wasting state and local hate crime investigation for some harmless graffiti which was likely painted by Muslim students themselves. 'University administrators and state religious and political leaders must speak out forcefully against the rising anti-Muslim hate in our society that results in such disturbing incidents,' said a statement from CAIR-MN executive director Jaylani Hussein. 'We urge campus police and other relevant law enforcement agencies to investigate this incident as a hate crime.' Hussein cited the 'Islamophobic rhetoric in the presidential election campaign,' particularly from Donald Trump, as a possible contributing factor to these types of incidents. (No, it's the abhorrent behavior of Muslims themselves that cause so many people around the world to hate Muslims)

BNI Store Nov 6 2016 GERMANY: Bigger than the Berlin Wall, the 12-foot-high 'Munich Wall' is being constructed to protect local residents from illegal alien Muslim invaders Locals campaigned for the wall, in the suburb of Neuperlach SÃ¼d, after authorities decided that some 160 young (up to age 40) unaccompanied Muslim illegals will move into a large shelter which is less than 100 metres from a residential estate. UK Daily Mail Critics say the wall is further proof of the alienation voters feel with Chancellor Angela Merkel's refugee policy. Deputy District Chairman Guido Bucholtz, said: 'I was frightened when I saw this monster of a wall.' (Not as frightened as Germans are of the Muslim invaders) He added that he thinks the wall is too high as another similar structure designed to fence off a migrant camp was just three metres high. He said: 'This whole propaganda really sucks.' (Yeah, I guess you don't like it when people find out you've been lying to them) However residents from the neighbouring housing development from the asylum centre went to court to get the wall built. One of their arguments for the wall was the fear that the value of their homes would plummet if there was nothing to separate them from the refugees who could be there for years to come. Local residents said they are fearful of the 'noise and behaviour' of the Muslim thugs. The judge of the Administrative Court in Munich confirmed the wall in a judgment '“ noted that the migrants should not use if for 'ball throwing games' or other 'leisure use'. The fact that it is higher than the Berlin Wall of the Cold War is not lost on locals and officials. But engineers said it had to be that high to provide an effective sound insulation. The wall is nearly finished. Locals say they do not care about how it looks; only that it will separate them from the unaccompanied Muslim freeloaders, rapists and jihadists who have often been at the centre of friction with locals in other German towns.

GERMANY: 'We are Somali Muslims, we don't have to pay' In Wabern, Hesse, a group of five Somali Muslim freeloaders sat down and had drinks at the 'Piano' pub. The group was there for the first time and Albayrak [the owner] didn't know them. They drank 'eight beers, two vodkas' and put everything on a tab. When Albayrak want to collect payment, there was anger. 'We are Somalis, we don't pay.' Source Two of the savages stood up and went out. Albayrak banned the other three from the establishment and threw them out. 'They were very aggressive, they were upset,' says Albayrak. The pub owner then shut the door. Suddenly, the owner heard a noise from outside. There was a 'boom, boom' sound. Albayrak looked out and saw two of the Somali Muslim thugs with iron rods beating on the pub door, shattering the glass. 'I was afraid they were going to kill me,' says the 58-year-old. He called the police but they didn't arrive for a half hour, and by then, the savages were already gone.

GERMAN INTERIOR MINISTER demands that Italy send all new illegal alien Muslim invaders back to Africa Germany's Minister of the Interior has launched a controversial proposal to return African Muslim male invaders home rather than bringing them to Italy, in order to discourage more economic freeloaders from attempting the dangerous crossing. Even worse, Italy has been rescuing them near Libya, not even waiting until they get within spitting distance of Italy. So, where are all the women and children? @moas_eu the taxi service just outside of Libya is part of the pull factor 
'” The Champ (@audioexpression) November 5, 2016 Breitbart Minister Thomas de MaiziÃ¨re said Sunday that those 'saved in the Mediterranean should be sent back to Africa' instead of taking them to Europe. According to a spokeswoman for the minister, this measure would serve a twofold purpose: discouraging new migrants from coming while also demolishing the organizations of human traffickers that organize the crossings. Germany's interior minister Thomas de Maiziere threatened to close Italy's border with Austria if Rome starts sending migrants north. With the migrant route through the Balkans from Greece closed, migrants are instead crossing the Mediterranean from North African countries such as Libya and arriving in Italy. De MaiziÃ¨re is not alone in his approach. 'The prevention of illegal migration does not start at our internal borders,' said Helmut Teichmann, director of the Germany's Federal Police. 'The aim of the federal government is to stop the refugees before they reach Europe,' he said. On Saturday, 2,200 more people tried to cross the Strait of Sicily in 16 different vessels, and were rescued in a series of operations coordinated by the Italian Coast Guard who later brought them to Italy. Rescuers also recovered ten bodies of migrants who drowned during the attempt. Critics were quick to remark that part of the incentive for attempting the crossing in the first place is the knowledge that migrant rescuers are providing a free 'taxi service' to Italy. Protesters have raised their voices in opposition to De MaiziÃ¨re's plan, claiming it was a 'scandal' that would effectively deny potential refugees the right of asylum, but the Minister did not back down. 'Eliminating the prospect of reaching Europe could keep them from risking their lives in a dangerous journey.' In point of fact, this year has seen the deaths of a record number of migrants during the perilous trip. On Thursday, some 240 migrants drowned in two shipwrecks off the coast of Libya, bringing the year's death toll in the Mediterranean to 4,220, compared with 3,777 in the whole of 2015. The Minister suggested that once the migrants were returned to Tunisia, Egypt or other North African countries, they could submit their asylum applications which, if approved, would allow them to reach Europe safely. 
As of 2 November, 159,496 people had reached Italy by sea so far in 2016, according to the International Organization of Migrants (IOM).

AUSTRIA: Freedom Party leader calls Chancellor Angela Merkel the 'most dangerous woman in Europe' Heinz-Christian Strache (right), chairman of the anti-Islamization Freedom Party roasted the German Chancellor for allowing an unlimited amount of Muslim illegal aliens which he claims has left Europe on the verge of civil war. Talking to supporters, Strache argued 'the uncontrolled influx of migrants alien to our culture who seep into our social welfare system'¦ makes civil war in the medium-term not unlikely.' Austrian Freedom Party (FPOe) party leader Heinz-Christian Strache (L) and Freedom Party's presidential candidate Norbert Hofer UK Express (h/t Terry D) Strache added that his party's presidential candidate, Norbert Hofer, 'will be there for all Austrians' in a rallying speech to drum up support ahead of the general election. Hofer has attempted to keep a neutral tone in a bid to broaden the typical appeal of the Freedom Party from an anti-immigration stance to the wider Austrian population ahead of a re-run of the earlier election. Yet the 45-year-old's recent election posters carry the phrase 'so help me God' '“ a term which has been slammed by both Islamic and Christian officials who say introducing God into the campaign is not appropriate. 'Vienna must not become Istanbul' He says what Vienna thinks Three branches of the Protestant church in Austria released a joint statement denouncing the slogan. It reads: 'God cannot be instrumentalised for one's own intentions or for political purposes. 'We consider that mentioning God'¦ to attack other religions and cultures indirectly amounts to an abuse of his name and religion in general.' The Freedom Party claim Hofer used the rallying phrase as it came 'directly from the heart' and 'is strongly anchored in Christian and Western values' which the party holds. Two-thirds of Austrians identify as Catholic while just four per cent are Protestant. The Freedom Party narrowly lost the election by just 31,000 votes to Alexander Van der Bellen's left-leaning Green party, but the result was ruled void after voting irregularities were discovered. The initial re-run of the election was due to take place in October but has been pushed back to December after defects were found in the postal vote envelopes.

BNI Store Nov 6 2016 UK: Muslim family who converted to Christianity forced to flee Manningham home as violence and threats by Muslims against them continue to escalate A British Christian convert who said he suffered 'seven years of persecution' from Muslims has been forced to flee his home under armed guard amid fears for his safety. Nissar Hussain was with his family when police arrived and moved him to a safe place. The Telegraph and Argus Mr Hussain said the culmination of the 'extreme persecution' had devastated his family and the dramatic arrival of armed police was a complete surprise. 'My family are distraught and extremely traumatised to be leaving,' said Mr Hussain. 'But when your life is at stake there is no other choice.' Mr Hussain converted to Christianity 20 years ago, but says in recent years he has been subjected to harassment and violence by sections of the Islamic community. 'This extreme persecution by certain people in the Muslim community because we are converts has broken us as a family,' he said. From left to right, Leena, Anniesa, Nissar, Sarah, Kubra, Issar, and Miriam Hussain, a Christian family who have been threatened with death for converting from Islam in West Yorkshire, England. 'We are fragmented and I do not know how we will recover from this. We haven't functioned properly for years.' He said 'serious questions' needed to be answered. Last year, Mr Hussain was hospitalized after his kneecap was smashed and his hand broken during an attack outside his home in St Paul's Road, Manningham . Two hooded men, one armed with a pick-axe handle, assaulted him in a vicious attack caught on CCTV. (See video below) At the time, Mr Hussain said he and his family were being driven out of the city and he was making plans to leave. This week he had started packing up his belongings when the police arrived on Thursday. The 50-year-old, who was a nurse before leaving work due to post-traumatic stress disorder, said his six children, aged eight to 24, and wife would never see their friends again. Nissar Hussain, 49, was hospitalised on 17 November 2015 with a smashed kneecap and broken arm after a violent attack which was captured on CCTV. He said he was attacked because he converted from Islam to Christianity and that his troubles started after he appeared on a Channel 4 documentary on how Islam converts are treated. He had been expecting an attack for some months, but when the police arrived he was 'none the wiser' that he was at such serious risk. 'The armed police arrived at about 3pm on Thursday,' he said. 'I had been loading a van up with our belongings for eight hours, having to stealthily check no-one could see what I was doing, before they arrived. Hussein stands in front of his car that was vandalized by Muslims 'It took me completely by surprise, but their [the police] professionalism was deeply reassuring, and they escorted my family and I to a safe haven outside Yorkshire.' Last night, a West Yorkshire Police spokesman said 'Our priority has always been to work effectively with our partners to minimise the risk to Mr Hussain and ensure that we maximise opportunities to put control measures in place to safeguard him, his family and consider any wider impact upon the communities across West Yorkshire,' he added. Neighbors demand justice for the persecuted Hussein family 'We are disappointed that Mr Hussain and his family have decided to leave Bradford, particularly as police and partners have been working together for some time to try and resolve the situation to the benefit of all parties concerned. 'All the incidents reported by Mr Hussain have been recorded in line with National guidance and we continue to proactively pursue lines of enquiry to identify the perpetrators and are committed to ensuring that a thorough and effective investigation is undertaken to mitigate the threat posed in the first instance and where possible bring the perpetrators to justice.

BNI Store Nov 7 2016 HERE THEY GO AGAIN! Muslims trying to claim that the Hebrew-language Dead Sea Scrolls are Arab Muslim in origin So, let me get this straight. The Dead Sea Scrolls are demonstrably written in Hebrew. But the Palestinians are now saying these ancient documents are, like Jerusalem's Temple Mount , the holiest site in Judaism, Arab Muslim in origin.That is how ridiculous the campaign to delegitimize Israel has become. Israel Today Carmel Shama-Hacohen '“ Israel's ambassador to the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) '“ said the Palestinians raised the matter informally during a recent meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin. JERUSALEM POST The dead Sea Scrolls are about 900 documents and Biblical texts, discovered in one of the greatest archaeological finds of the 20th century in the 1940's and 50's in caves in and around Qumran on the northwest shore of the Dead Sea. The texts include some of the only known surviving copies of Biblical documents made before 100 B.C.E., and preserve evidence of Jewish life during the Second Temple period. According to the ambassador and to representatives of the Israel Antiquities Authority who were present at the meeting, the Palestinians intend to make a formal claim to the Dead Sea Scrolls when the committee next convenes in 2017. 'This is another provocative and audacious attempt by the Palestinians to rewrite history and to erase our connection to our land,' Shama-Hacohen told The Jerusalem Post . 'The Dead Sea Scrolls are factual and weighty archeological evidence of the presence of the Jewish people in the Land of Israel.' '[The accusation is] part of an ongoing effort to deny the continuous Jewish presence in Israel. The Dead Sea Scrolls provide incontrovertible proof of the historical facts that underpin the legitimacy of Israel as a Jewish state,' David Koschitzky, chairman of the UJA Federation in Toronto. 'As such, they pose a threat to the ongoing attempts to obscure the unique relationship of the Jewish people with the land of Israel.

BNI Store Nov 7 2016 BIGGEST MUSLIM LIE OF THE DAY: 'White supremacists are openly threatening Election Day violence'¦so the FBI is hassling Muslims' Is it the inbreeding? Or just that they think they can promote any fantastical lie or obfuscation and the Kardashian-worshipping American public won't notice. It's been reported for days that The Islamic State/al-Qaeda is calling for the 'slaughter of U.S. voters' on Election Day. But that didn't stop officials from designated terrorist group CAIR from inventing a fake potential threat against Muslims'¦to deflect the fact that the FBI is questioning potential terror-linked suspects in the Muslim community. USA Today Ritz Katz, director of the SITE Intelligence Group, said Saturday on Twitter that the threats appear in an essay carried by the Islamic State's Al Hayat media center that declares militants 'have come to slaughter you and smash your ballot boxes.' 3) #ISIS urges Muslims to refuse participate in #Elections2016 & to announce that they 'have come to slaughter you & smash your ballot boxes'

Murtadd is an apostate who turns his back on Islam. The essay, which uses lengthy religious arguments in an effort to justify such attacks, also declares there is no difference between the Republican and Democratic parties in their 'policies against Islam and Muslims' In an article from the perpetually Muslim-sympathizing Fusion website: As if Muslim Americans haven't had it hard enough during this presidential campaign'”what with Donald Trump's steady drumbeat of Islamophobic racism'“now comes reports that federal agents are paying surprise visits to Muslims across the United States ahead of the November 8 election. According to officials from the Council on American Islamic Relations, representatives from the FBI have questioned Muslims living in at least eight states leading up to November 8, reportedly searching for information pertaining to a possible Election Day al Qaeda threat . Over the weekend, the designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American Islamic Relations) received reports from Muslim-Americans in eight states, who said they were approached by FBI agents who wanted to speak to them about the alleged threat. Those states included California, Washington State, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kansas Oklahoma, Florida and Texas. Hassan Shibly, executive director of CAIR's Florida offices, called the reported questioning 'completely outrageous,' and 'borderline unconstitutional,' telling the Washington Post : 'That's the equivalent of the FBI visiting churchgoing Christians because someone overseas was threatening to blow up an abortion clinic. It's that preposterous and outrageous.' The people who were interviewed this weekend were asked if they knew anyone who might want to harm Americans at home or abroad. Shibly said all of those interviewed appeared to be of Afghani or Pakistani descent. Shibly says such sweeps are dangerous to Muslim-American relations.'Unfortunately we're dealing with an environment that's not very friendly to American Muslims,' he said. 'The environment is very hostile to the American Muslim community.' On Twitter, CAIR's Dallas-Fort Worth director Alia Salem posted a short video updating her followers about the FBI visits, and offering a series of resources for anyone approached by law enforcement. 'It was made apparent to us that the FBI has a list of a couple hundred people they are wanting to visit,' Salem told the Dallas Morning News . 'And ask a series of eight generic questions intended to drum up information about the attacks.' The FBI's sudden scrutiny of Muslim Americans comes as the United States is experiencing a surge in white nationalism and militia groups , fueled in no small part by Donald Trump's KKK-backed candidacy . Militant Trump supporters have, in fact, explicitly stoked fears of violence come Election Day. (But it's Muslims who actually carry out terrorist attacks on Americans) 'Prior to this campaign season, these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the American political landscape,' Ryan Lenz, a researcher at the anti-American, Muslim-funded Southern Poverty Law Center told Reuters . 'Now these ideas are legitimized.' Perhaps while the FBI is questioning Muslim Americans over vague international threats, they should check in with some of the no-longer-fringe radicals on America's far right wing, too.
