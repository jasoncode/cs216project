Posted on October 26, 2016 Blacks and Liberals Want to Abolish Science Dan Roodt, American Renaissance, October 26, 2016 The South African 'fallist' movement finds another target. 
On my recent visit to Stockholm for the Identitarian Conference, some Swedes and I compared notes on whose country was the most crazy-liberal and anti-white. The Swedes pointed to a short video recently released by an NGO that said Swedes should 'integrate' into the culture of third-world immigrants to form a 'new country.' 
My Swedish colleagues agreed with French author Renaud Camus. Writing on Free West Media , he argues that, whereas white populations everywhere seem determined to be replaced by third-worlders, 'the case of Sweden is even more tragic, more extreme, more insane. Nowhere else do a people and a nation show a stronger will to suicide.' 
But I believe South Africa is worse. We have actual laws, regulations and policies that require corporations, universities and sports bodies to replace whites. Our country has become the world champion of anti-white, anti-Western ideology. Together with our northern neighbor Zimbabwe, we are to multiculturalism what Pol Pot's short-lived Democratic Kampuchea was to communism: its most extreme expression. Pol Pot waged genocide against the entire middle class of Cambodia in order to start a 'new society.' 
South Africa's ruling elite also wants a 'new society' that will be cleansed of Western influences and even the white race. As Robert Mugabe put it during his famous 2015 visit to Soweto: 'I don't want to see a white face.' 
The current upheavals at our universities'“known absurdly as the 'fallist movement''“have been widely reported. Enraged black students, egged on by 'understanding' whites, have demanded that one thing after another must 'fall,' each accompanied by its own hashtag. First it was #RhodesMustFall (the statue of Cecil Rhodes at the University of Cape Town), then #AfrikaansMustFall (blacks want to eliminate Afrikaans as a language of university instruction), followed by #FeesMustFall (they want tuition fees abolished) and now, #ScienceMustFall. 
In a video that has had nearly a million views, a female black student at the University of Cape Town called for science to be scrapped, saying: 
If I personally were committed to decolonization, science as a whole is a product of Western modernity and the whole thing should be scratched off. So if you want practical solutions to how to decolonize science, we have to restart science from'“I don't know'“from an African perspective, from our perspective, from how we've experienced science. For instance, I have a question for all the science people: There is a place in KZN called Umhlab'uyalingana. They believe that through the magic, the black magic'“you call it black magic, they call it witchcraft'“you are able to send lightening to strike someone. Can you explain that scientifically because it's something that happens? 
The initial reaction was widespread ridicule from ordinary whites, but I knew that her dismissal of Western science was not taking place in a vacuum and was connected with the cultural-Marxist ideas swirling through most Western universities. After all, Herbert Marcuse, one of the founders of cultural Marxism wrote this in 'An Essay on Liberation' in 1969, at the height of US student radicalism: 
This is the Hippie subculture: 'trip,''grass,''pot,''acid,' and so on. But a far more subversive universe of discourse announces itself in the language of black militants. Here is a systematic linguistic rebellion, which smashes the ideological context in which the words are employed and defined, and places them into the opposite context'“negation of the established one. Thus, the blacks 'take over' some of the most sublime and sublimated concepts of Western civilization, desublimate and redefine them. (p. 35) 
Needless to say, Marcuse approved of the black 'take over,' and if he were alive today, he would surely applaud what is happening in South Africa. Not only are blacks taking over Western concepts and changing them into their opposites, they are taking over our institutions as well. 
In universities and the mainstream media there was actually praising this young 'fallist.' I was only slightly surprised to read a piece in Afrikaans entitled, ' #ScienceMustFall nie so belaglik soos dit mag klink ' (#ScienceMustFall not so ridiculous as it sounds). It was written by Liezel de Lange, the managing director of our Sunday newspaper Rapport , which once supported apartheid and segregation. 
Miss De Lange first confessed ignorance because she attended the University of Pretoria in the days when it still taught Western ideas and culture. She laments that when she studied English literature 'almost all our prescribed works were from Britain (and Ireland), as well as the USA. I have to give my lecturers at the time credit for assigning readings from Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe and Ngugi wa Thiong'o.' Most Westerners no doubt have deficient educations because they have not been taught Ngugi wa Thiong'o. 
Although Liezel de Lange did not exactly endorse the science-must-fall idea, in defense of the young fallist she evoked the mythical 'medieval African university' of Timbuktu as evidence that Africa's vast contributions to world learning are being ignored. In fact, Timbuktu was a center for Islamic and Tuareg schools, not a hub of forgotten African or black science. Nor are Africans themselves united in wanting to preserve what is left of the 'medieval African university.' Recent Al Qaeda activity in the region has been so destructive that the New Yorker recently ran a story called ' Has the Great Library of Timbuktu Been Lost? ' 
I asked Liezel de Lange on Twitter whether she was an Afrocentrist, but she evaded the question, answering that she merely 'posits that not all knowledge, wisdom and insight come from the West.' It's hard to disagree with that. 
Miss De Lange's column was just a watered-down version of a more radical piece she had read on the left-wing website The Daily Maverick by Joel Modiri, called ' In the Fall: Decolonisation and the rejuvenation of the academic project in South Africa .' 
Mr. Modiri is a black academic at UNISA (University of South Africa), which has been racially 'transformed''“meaning that whites have been all but banished. It is Africa's largest correspondence university, naturally founded by South African whites. Mr. Modiri explained that 'her [the fallists] error proves her point.' He decried: 
the presentation of knowledge by South African universities as predominantly the product of the West, and the failure to recognize that some of the major scientific disciplines (medicine, physics, astronomy, mathematics, among others) have deep heritages in Africa, China and India . . . . 
In other words, she is a victim of the false, Eurocentric view that science is Western to begin with. Some American blacks have long maintained that the West stole its knowledge from Africa. They never explain how science could be 'stolen' from one people by another, leaving no trace behind. Knowledge is not like the Mona Lisa, which cannot exist in more than one place, so it is strange that the wise Africans who conceived of science and culture no longer possessed it once it was 'stolen' from them. 
But we have to remember Samuel Huntington's dictum in his book The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order : 'culture follows power.' If anything, this is what the rest of the world might learn from South Africa: Whoever dominates politically will impose his culture and beliefs, even if they are more primitive than those it replaces. Once the scientist has been politically and culturally subjugated he may have to bow down to the witchdoctor. 
Unfortunately, it is not only pseudo-intellectual blacks such as Mr. Modiri who hate the West. One of the most Europhobic statements in support of the black UCT student came from Stuart Theobald, a white-liberal English South African academic who 'divides his time between London and Johannesburg.' 
In the same Rapport that Liezel de Lange edits, Mr. Theobald writes of the need to 'decolonize' science because 'it has been used to justify racism' and to support 'biological racism.' He continues: 
We are kidding ourselves if we pretend that colonial attitudes are not still affecting the way science works today. This is why a deliberate effort to decolonise science is valuable and South African universities have the opportunity to lead the charge. 
He adds that we need a new paradigm in science 'that recognises the racism embedded in much of scientific practice and methodology,' and that 'a postcolonial science' that is 'shorn of the straitjacket of past thinking' will solve problems that now baffle us. He notes the 'fuss' made over the fallist student's comments and then asks: 'But when you see the entanglement of racism and science, can you blame her?' 
Are South African blacks and white liberals ready to ditch science in favor of the 'dark arts' as Harry Potter would say? If they have tooth aches or appendicitis, I suspect they will submit to the humiliation of 'colonial science' rather than look for a cure in the traditional rituals and voodoo of Africa.

A Lot of People in the US Are Suddenly Identifying as 'White' Eric D. Knowles and Linda R. Tropp, Quartz, October 25, 2016 
Many political commentators credit Donald Trump's rise to white voters' antipathy toward racial and ethnic minorities. However, we believe this focus on racial resentment obscures another important aspect of racial thinking. 
In a study of white Americans' attitudes and candidate preferences, we found that Trump's success reflects the rise of 'white identity politics''“an attempt to protect the collective interests of white voters via the ballot box. Whereas racial prejudice refers to animosity toward other racial groups, white identity reflects a sense of connection to fellow white Americans. 
We're not the first to tie Trump's candidacy to white identity politics . But our data provide some of the clearest evidence that ongoing demographic changes in the United States are increasing white racial identity. White identity, in turn, is pushing white Americans to support Trump. 
White identity 
When we talk about white identity, we're not referring to the alt-right fringe, the white nationalist movement, or others who espouse racist beliefs. Rather, we're talking about everyday white Americans who, perhaps for the first time, are racially conscious. 
{snip} 
Non-Hispanic whites are projected to become a minority in the year 2044. This increasing diversity across the country is making whites' own race harder and harder to ignore. {snip} 
Trump and white identity politics 
As whites increasingly sense that their status in society is falling , white racial identity is becoming politicized. Trump's promise to 'make America great again' speaks to these anxieties by recalling a past in which white people dominated every aspect of politics and society. {snip} 
{snip} 
To test our ideas about Trump and white identity politics, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of about 1,700 white Americans. The survey covered racial identities, attitudes, and political preferences. In examining the relationship between white identity and ethnic diversity, we chose to focus on an ethnic minority of particular salience in contemporary politics: Hispanics. {snip} 
Do whites from heavily Hispanic neighborhoods show stronger white racial identity? To measure identity, we used a widely-used questionnaire . On a five-point scale, participants rated their agreement with items such as 'Being a white person is an important part of how I see myself' and 'I feel solidarity with other white people.' As shown in the graph below, there is a positive relationship between exposure to Hispanics and white respondents' sense of racial identity. 
And does white identity lead to support for Donald Trump? We examined the relationship between white identity and respondents' likelihood of supporting Trump for the presidency versus Hillary Clinton or several Republican primary challengers. Consistent with others' analyses , white identity strongly predicts a preference for Trump. 
Whites at the high end of the racial identity scale are more than four times as likely to support Trump than those at the low end of the scale. Perhaps that's because whites highest in racial identity are also the ones most likely to harbor negative attitudes against Latinos. Indeed, we found white identity was significantly correlated with another characteristic'“prejudice. 
However, differences in prejudice don't explain the relationship between white identity and Trump support. The pattern in the figure above was tested while statistically controlling for levels of anti-Hispanic prejudice. Because the relationship between identity and support for Trump remains strong, we are confident that white identity independently predicts greater Trump support. 
We've seen that living close to Hispanics leads whites to develop a strong sense of racial identity and that strong racial identity is associated with support for Donald Trump. We should therefore expect that whites in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods support Trump more often than those in neighborhoods with fewer Hispanics. This prediction gains credence from work by political scientist Ryan Enos, who finds that everyday exposure to Latinos can increase support for restrictive immigration policies. 
Whites' support for Donald Trump is, in fact, greatest in areas with a large Hispanic population.

Feds: 275,000 Born to Illegals in One Year, Would Fill City the Size of Orlando Paul Bedard, Washington Examiner, October 26, 2016 
Moms in the United States illegally gave birth to 275,000 babies in 2014, enough birthright U.S. citizens to fill a city the size of Orlando, Florida, according to an analysis of data from the National Center for Health Statistics. 
The data showed that newborns to illegals accounted for 7 percent of all births in 2014, according to the analysis from the Pew Research Center. 
{snip} 
The analysis also found that the growth in the birthrate of America is entirely driven by immigrants. 
'While the annual number of babies born in the U.S. has fluctuated in recent years'“most markedly during the Great Recession when there was a significant drop in births nationwide'“the trajectory over the past four decades or so has been upward. In 2014, there were 4 million births in the U.S., compared with 3.74 million in 1970,' said Pew. 
'This growth has been driven entirely by the increasing numbers of babies born to immigrant women. In 2014, immigrant women accounted for about 901,000 U.S. births, which marked a threefold increase from 1970 when immigrant women accounted for about 274,000 births. Meanwhile, the annual number of births to U.S.-born women dropped by 11 percent during that same time period, from 3.46 million in 1970 to 3.10 million in 2014,' added Pew.

Surge of Migrants Illegally Crossing U.S.-Mexico Border Ahead of Election Manuel Bojorquez, CBS News, October 25, 2016 
Every day, dozens of men, women and children stream through the streets of McAllen, Texas to a migrant center at Sacred Heart Catholic Church. 
They have just illegally crossed into the U.S. and have been released by border patrol, with ankle monitors, while they file for asylum. 
{snip} 
'We're getting mass spikes of people crossing and turning themselves in,' said Agent Chris Cabrera, who is with the local border patrol union. 
Cabrera said on some days, they've encountered up to a thousand immigrants along this stretch of the border. He said the election is partly to blame for the surge. 
'The smugglers are telling them if Hillary gets elected, that there'll be some sort of amnesty, that they need to get here by a certain date. They're also being told that if Trump gets elected, there's going to be some magical wall that pops up overnight and once that wall gets up, nobody will ever get in again,' Cabrera said.

Hispanic Crowd Boos Marco Rubio off Stage Rafael Bernal, The Hill, October 25, 2016 
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) took the stage in Orlando at Calle Orange, a Puerto Rican-themed festival, on Sunday when some in the crowd started booing, NPR reported . 
The jeering got louder as the Cuban-American senator, seeking reelection after dropping his presidential bid earlier this year, was introduced. 
And when the emcee asked for applause as Rubio took the same, boos drowned out any supporters in the crowd, NPR added. 
'Thank you for having me today,' Rubio said in Spanish. 'I want you to enjoy this day. We're not going to talk about politics today. Thank God for this beautiful day, and for our freedom, our democracy, our vote, and our country. God bless you all, thank you very much.' 
He left the stage to more boos from the crowd, according to the report. 
{snip} 
Rubio is running against Rep. Patrick Murphy (D), and the latest average of polls in the race shows Rubio ahead by about 3 points. 
Murphy's campaign seized on the Sunday incident and blasted out video it says shows the booing. It also noted that Murphy attended the festival 'with a leader for Puerto Rican communities, Rep. Nydia Velazquez,' while 'Marco Rubio was booed off the stage.' 
Rubio's campaign shared a video with The Hill Monday that it says counters what the Murphy campaign sent out and shows him being greeted enthusiastically as he moves through the crowd. 
{snip} 
Festival attendants said they disapproved of Rubio's endorsement of Trump, who is deeply unpopular among Hispanics. 
'When we have someone like Trump, who hits our Mexican brothers, our Latino brothers, then you jump on that bandwagon after all that stuff he says not only about you personally . . . as a Latino, you're a freaking sellout. I would not vote for him if they paid me,' Calle Orange attendant Angel Marin told NPR about Rubio.

Loading Posted on October 26, 2016 Justice Department Faces Uphill Battle Should Officer Daniel Pantaleo Be Charged in Eric Garner Case, Experts Say John Marzulli, NY Daily News, October 25, 2016 
As the Justice Department looks to indict NYPD Office Daniel Pantaleo by year's end in the civil rights probe of the Eric Garner police chokehold case, experts said Tuesday that bitter in-fighting between prosecutors has made a potential trial a defense lawyer's dream. 
The probe is now firmly in the hands of the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., which appears to have overruled recommendations from Brooklyn prosecutors and FBI investigators not to indict the NYPD cop, sources said. 
The New York-based feds determined they could not bring a criminal civil rights case against Officer Pantaleo for Garner's death'“leading the Department of Justice to take control of the case. 
Defense lawyers and former prosecutors said the unusual split opens a trove of evidence that could potentially help Pantaleo if he's indicted. 
When U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch gives the department's civil rights division the green light to charge Pantaleo with violating Garner's civil rights, it could reveal the deep division between the branches of the Justice Department. 
The key, however, is the defense getting its hands on the information and being allowed by a judge to quiz witnesses about it, the sources said. 
{snip} 
The federal civil rights criminal case would hinge on proving that Pantaleo 'intended' to violate Garner's civil rights, which is a high threshold because it aims to get inside the cop's head when he brought Garner to the ground. 
{snip} 
Defense lawyer Eric Franz said he would seek any prosecutorial memos regarding justification of a federal civil rights charge to examine the factual reasons behind the Brooklyn office's recommendation, but agreed it remains a longshot. 
A greater problem is the damage this dispute is doing to the Justice Department's credibility, Franz said. 
'I have enormous respect for Mr. Capers (Robert Capers, Brooklyn U.S. attorney) and his office, and they were in the best position to determine whether charges are warranted,' he said.

Anti-Trump Violence Sweeps the Nation Matthew Vadum, LifeZette, October 26, 2016 
While the mainstream media has been working day and night promoting Hillary Clinton's candidacy, it has largely ignored or downplayed violent attacks against supporters of Donald Trump. 
But assaults on Trump supporters appear to be growing increasingly common as Election Day approaches and tensions intensify. Reports of Trump lawn signs and banners being stolen and defaced are everywhere on social media. 
Making matters worse, undercover video evidence emerged showing senior Democrat operatives Robert Creamer and Scott Foval acknowledging using dirty, likely illegal tricks against the Trump campaign. Their goal was to generate negative media coverage of Trump rallies by fomenting violence at them. The media eagerly used the various fisticuffs and melees the Democrats created to attempt to discredit Trump by depicting his supporters as violent, knuckle-dragging crazies. 
{snip} 
Despite their aversion to covering stories that put Trump in a sympathetic light, members of the media had no choice but to cover the extremely newsworthy Oct. 15 weekend firebombing of Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. Gov. Pat McCrory called the arson 'an attack on our democracy,' while one GOP official called it an act of 'political terrorism.' Spray-painted on the building next door were a swastika and the sentence 'Nazi Republicans get out of town or else.' 
Meanwhile, most physical attacks on Trump supporters make only local news outlet'“if that. Rarely do such assaults get mentioned on the evening TV broadcast news or in The New York Times or The Washington Post. That's because they don't fit the leftist narrative that Republicans are violent, racist, Islamophobic homophobes. 
{snip} 
Here is a compilation of some of the attacks on Trump supporters: 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, 'Why can't they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?' 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. 'The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by 'some thugs' that a barmaid called out from the back.' Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a 'Blue Lives Matter' shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a 'Make America Great Again' baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
On Sept. 26 at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota, as the first presidential debate was about to get underway, a woman wearing Trump campaign apparel was assaulted while heading to a debate watch event. {snip} 
On Aug. 19 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Trump supporters had to run a gauntlet of angry protesters to get into a Trump fundraiser at the Minneapolis Convention Center. When they left after the event they were hit, pushed, and spit on. 
{snip} 
On Aug. 3 in Bloomfield, New Jersey, an assailant attacked a 62-year-old man who was walking down the street wearing a pro-Trump T-shirt, local police said. 'The motorist inquired why [the man] was wearing the shirt, directing profanities at him,' a police spokesman said. 'The [victim] continued to walk away as [the] motorist followed him.' The motorist hit the man several times with a crowbar, causing injuries to his arms, hands, and thighs, 
{snip} 
This is not an exhaustive list of violent attacks on Trump supporters. 
No doubt there will be plenty more such assaults in the final two weeks, as Americans head to the polls. 
And Hillary Clinton's campaign may be involved in those attacks.

Fearing Election Day Trouble, Some US Schools Cancel Classes Newsmax, October 26, 2016 
Rigged elections. Vigilante observers. Angry voters. The claims, threats and passions surrounding the presidential race have led communities around the U.S. to move polling places out of schools or cancel classes on Election Day. 
The fear is that the ugly rhetoric of the campaign could escalate into confrontations and even violence in school hallways, endangering students. 
'If anybody can sit there and say they don't think this is a contentious election, then they aren't paying much attention,' said Ed Tolan, police chief in Falmouth, Maine, which decided to call off classes on Election Day and put additional officers on duty Nov. 8. 
{snip} 
Schools are popular polling places because they have plenty of parking and are usually centrally located. It's difficult to say how many school-based polling places have been moved this year, given how decentralized the voting process is across the country. 
But state and local officials say voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere. 
'There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering, that we didn't have 15 or 20 years ago. What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something?' said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. 'If that happens at a school, then that's certainly concerning.' 
{snip} 
Easton Superintendent John Reinhart wanted to get voting out of schools altogether but was rebuffed by county election officials. So the school board canceled classes on Election Day. 
'If you take the personalities away and cast the emotion with the election aside, one has to ask the question: 'Are our schools the best places for that activity to take place?'' he said. 'I just think we've reached the point where we need to look at other locations.'

Minnesota Somali Groups Join to Speak with One Voice at Capitol Mila Koumpilova, Star Tribune, October 25, 2016 
Minnesota's largest Somali nonprofits are teaming up to present a unified lobbying front to the state this winter. 
In recent months, the leaders of eight Somali community groups joined forces on several projects, hired a lobbyist and scored face time with the state's lieutenant governor. Now, the new coalition is gearing up to ask state legislators for about $11 million for Somali community initiatives, building on $2 million Gov. Mark Dayton earmarked for such projects in this year's budget. 
'Why not combine our separate efforts and do a better collaborative effort?' said Mohamud Noor, head of the Confederation of Somali Community, a coalition member. 
Spearheaded by the Minneapolis Foundation, the initiative is also a bid to nudge Somali-American nonprofits to better track and report results. 
A University of Southern California study last year found Somali-Americans celebrate the work of some leaders of 35 registered nonprofits and a host of more informal groups. But they distrust others. Study participants perceived some self-styled community leaders'“dubbed 'the Pretenders''“as adept at applying for grants but with little to show for it. 
{snip} 
This year's state budget includes $2 million for investments in the Somali community'“part of Dayton's package of $35 million for addressing racial disparities in Minnesota. The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, and the nonprofit Youthprise each received roughly half of the money, which they will distribute in grants. The department is now weighing 30 proposals worth a total of $6.7 million for its half. 
'The $2 million wasn't even close to being sufficient,' Warfa said. 'We are asking for more money.' 
Weli says the group also wants to push the state to entrust Somali-led nonprofits with funds directly, rather than steering resources to state agencies. 
'The system is not structured so that people of color serve themselves,' she said. 'They are always the recipients of services.' 
{snip} 
The group is calling for investments to encourage entrepreneurship and homeownership, expand mental health services, provide culturally sensitive prenatal care and spur youth leadership. 
A more specific proposal is still a work in progress, leaders acknowledge. 
{snip} 
Mohamed Ahmed, a creator of cartoons lampooning extremists, who is not part of the coalition, says many in the community feel acute mistrust of local nonprofits and community leaders. 
'You can literally throw a stone and hit a nonprofit in the community; there are so many of them, God help us,' said Ahmed, whose Average Mohamed initiative recently became a nonprofit as well. 'Accountability and monitoring effectiveness are big issues.' 
Ahmed says Warfa is well-respected, and a group of nonprofits that will hold each other accountable is a promising step.

Gambia Joins South Africa and Burundi in Exodus from International Criminal Court AFP, October 26, 2016 
Gambia has announced its withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC), accusing the Hague-based tribunal of the 'persecution and humiliation of people of colour, especially Africans'. 
The announcement late Tuesday comes after similar decisions this month by South Africa and Burundi to abandon the troubled institution, set up to try the world's worst crimes. 
Information Minister Sheriff Bojang said in an announcement on state television that the court had been used 'for the persecution of Africans and especially their leaders' while ignoring crimes committed by the West. 
He singled out the case of former British prime minister Tony Blair, who the ICC decided not to indict over the Iraq war. 
{snip} 
The withdrawal, he said, 'is warranted by the fact that the ICC, despite being called International Criminal Court, is in fact an International Caucasian Court for the persecution and humiliation of people of colour, especially Africans'. 
The ICC, set up in 2002, is often accused of bias against Africa and has also struggled with a lack of cooperation, including from the United States, which has signed the court's treaty but never ratified it. 
Gambia has been trying without success to use the court to punish the European Union for deaths of thousands of African migrants trying to reach its shores. 
{snip} 
South Africa's decision followed a dispute last year when Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir visited the country despite being the subject of an ICC arrest warrant over alleged war crimes. 
Earlier this month, Burundi said it would leave the court, while Namibia and Kenya have also raised the possibility.

Our New Country: Women And Minorities Hardest Hit Ann Coulter, VDARE, October 26, 2016 
Every ethnic group except whites bloc-votes for the Democrats. Coincidentally, the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. 
It doesn't help that white voters can't agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. In 2012, working-class whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the out-of-touch rich guy they saw in Mitt Romney. This year, the out-of-touch rich guys say they'll vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross. 
The sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats'“the top .01 percent. The rest of us will be their servants. 
The people who will be worse off are everybody else'“the working class, the middle class (who will soon be working class) and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. 
Look to Mexico for your future'“or any Third World country. Or to Univision's Jorge Ramos. The ruling class in Mexico is composed of European-looking, white descendants of Spanish conquistadors who raped the native population, giving them only their Spanish names in return. (British settlers in America brought women with them.) 
Explaining Latino culture's acceptance of incest and child rape, criminal justice researcher Shana Maier writes in a book about rape that 'the male is the head of the household, and women are subordinate to men. . . . Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to blame the victim. The victim, not the perpetrator, is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family.' 
One American detective said that, today, police are being taught to keep an 'open mind' about child rape because 'it's a cultural thing.' 
{snip} 
, our media already have a totally 'open mind' about incest and child rape'“and murder!'“when it's committed by immigrants. 
{snip} 
Immigrant women arrive in America, thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable, only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country, too'“provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled. 
{snip} 
Perhaps American men could do better, but, as American women may soon discover: They never had it so good. 
Manifestly, the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help Americans'“or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like America. They are designed to funnel welfare-dependent voters to the Democrats and cheap labor to the rich. {snip} 
Our country will be Zimbabwe, but'“if all goes according to the Democrats' plan'“they'll get to be Mugabe! 
That's Hillary's dream. If she wins, Joe Sobran's parody of the typical New York Times headline (about anything) will come true: 'Women and Minorities Hit Hardest.'

Trump Promises 'New Deal for Black America' Ben Kamisar, The Hill, October 26, 2016 
Donald Trump called for a 'new deal for black America' in a Wednesday afternoon address as he works to bridge the gap he faces with the crucial voting bloc less than two weeks from Election Day. 
Speaking in Charlotte, N.C., the GOP presidential nominee criticized years of Democratic rule for leaving black America behind and outlined his plan to help. 
My 'deal is grounded in three promises: safe communities, great education and high-paying jobs,' Trump said, speaking off what appeared to be scripted remarks 
'Whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion. We live in a very divided country, and I will be your greatest champion.' 
{snip} 
'African-American citizens have sacrificed so much for our nation. They fought and died in every war since the Revolution and from the pews and the picket lines, they've lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for civil rights. Yet too many African-Americans have been left behind.' 
Trump called for incentives to move companies into blighted neighborhoods to bolster employment, help African-Americans get better access to credit and push cities to declare 'blighted communities' disaster areas to help rebuild infrastructure. 
He also said he'd support increasing the number of police officers in such areas, connecting a lack of officers to a rise in murder rate in major cities. 
But while Trump's call focused on removing 'gang members and criminal cartels,' he blamed Clinton for promoting a 'war on police.' He did not mention the accusations of police brutality by minorities who feel that they are disproportionately targeted.

Are Detroit's Most Terrible Schools Unconstitutional? Geoffrey R. Stone, New York Times, October 21, 2016 
At one Detroit school, just 4 percent of third graders scored proficient on Michigan's English assessment test. At another, 9.5 percent did. Those students are among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed last month that asserts that children have a federal constitutional right to the opportunity to learn to read and write. 
Illiteracy is the norm at those 'slumlike' schools and others in Michigan's biggest city, according to the plaintiffs. The facilities are decrepit and unsafe. The first thing some teachers do each morning is clean up rodent feces before their students arrive. In some cases, teachers buy the books and school supplies, even the toilet paper. 
Lawyers for the students are arguing, in effect, that Michigan is denying their clients the right to a minimally adequate education, an issue that has been raised over the years in courts in other states under their state constitutions. 
{snip} 
Now the litigation in Detroit is raising this issue under the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court has never addressed whether disparities among schools would be constitutionally permissible if, as the court put it in 1973, a state failed 'to provide each child with an opportunity to acquire the basic minimal skills necessary' for success in life. 
In that bitterly divided 5-4 decision, San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, the court upheld a Texas law that produced unequal levels of education to students living in different school districts based on the property tax revenues of each district. 
The majority maintained that the law was constitutional because it served a rational policy of permitting each school district to decide for itself how much money to spend on education. Whether the level of education was at least minimally adequate in the state's poorest schools was not at issue in the case. 
In what is likely to be the opening chapter in a long legal saga, a federal district judge in Michigan must determine if a state can constitutionally provide a vast majority of its students with an excellent or at least adequate education while a minority of students receive an education that denies them the chance to acquire the minimum skills the court spoke of 43 years ago in Rodriguez. 
{snip} 
But in the case of children who are attending a public school, how do we know whether a state has denied some of its children even the minimal level of education required by the 14th Amendment? That is the burden that the plaintiffs in the Detroit case must meet. After reviewing their evidence, the case seems to be open-and-shut. 
As the plaintiffs demonstrate, 'decades of state disinvestment in and deliberate indifference to the Detroit schools' have denied these children 'access to the most basic building block of education: literacy.' At the schools involved in this litigation, which serve almost exclusively low-income minority children, the student proficiency rates 'hover near zero in nearly all core subject areas.' At one school, for example, 100 percent of the sixth graders scored below proficiency in reading.

Demonstrators Protest Outside Blue Cat Cafe, Say Graffiti Didn't Come from Them Katie Hall, Statesman, October 21, 2016 
More than a dozen people participated in a heated protest against gentrification outside an East Austin cafe Friday evening, but organizers denied being involved in the vandalism discovered at the business earlier today . 
The protest was organized by Defend Our Hoodz , which pointed at Blue Cat Cafe, located at East Cesar Chavez and Navasota streets, as one of many examples of gentrification in the area. 
{snip} 
The protest was heated at times. At one point, a few of the protesters surrounded and yelled at the cafe's owner, who argued with them while standing outside the cafe. 
{snip} 
Blue Cat Cafe opened its doors a year ago on Oct. 17. It replaced the family-run piÃ±ata store Jumpolin, which was demolished in February 2015. Jumpolin's owners said the eight-year-old business had been torn down with no notification, and the demolition sparked protests as people argued that the event symbolized how Austinites and Austin landowners are pushing out minority residents and business owners as the city grows. 
{snip} 
On Friday morning, the owner of Blue Cat Cafe discovered graffiti on the business' walls that read 'you gentrified scum.' The doors had also been glued shut, temporarily trapping the cafe's cats inside. 
{snip} 
The cafe's owner asked the Statesman not to use her name because of multiple death threats that she said she's gotten from protesters who opposed the demolition of Jumpolin. 
'The vandalism and the mental anguish they've caused me and the cyber-bullying they do'“it's really out of control,' the owner said. 'They show up with megaphones and they yell profanity; they send me emails with pictures of dead cats and pigs.'

Jenice Armstrong, Philly, October 26, 2016 
The Temple attacks were about troublemaking teens'“not race. 
The youngsters who jumped those college students as they walked to campus Friday night are delinquents who need to be put in check before it's too late. 
They were nothing but miscreants who took out their aggression and misdirected rage on random passersby. Why? Because they felt like wilding out that night. They were out to create chaos, so they did. 
So, don't talk to me about gentrification in North Philly. 
Don't talk to me about poverty. 
Don't talk to me about race relations. 
Those are whole other conversations and not what these attacks were about. 
No one was safe from these teens that night. Not the six Temple students who were injured. Not the Temple police officer knocked from her bicycle by a 15-year-old. Not even a police horse. Anyone could have gotten caught up in that madness. 
According to news reports, a crowd of 150 youngsters started gathering after an Instagram advertised an 8 p.m. meet-up at the AMC North Broad Street 7 (formerly the Pearl Theater at Avenue North), on Broad Street near Oxford at the southern end of the campus. 
{snip} 
Most of the high schoolers who responded to the online posting were good kids looking to socialize. But then the delinquents did what they often do and ruined it for everybody. 
According to police, a group of 20 to 30 boys and girls in their early to late teens randomly attacked Temple students as they returned from a football game at Lincoln Financial Field. 
{snip} 
People keep trying to make this a racial thing because at least two of the victims were white and all of the assailants were African American. They make that assumption even though we don't know the race of the other injured students. (Lots of African Americans go to Temple.) Nor do we know the race of the injured officers. 
Street violence is street violence. It knows no skin color. {snip} 
{snip} 
Another student, a junior environmental science major who didn't give her name, told a website called theTab.com, 'My boyfriend ran and got away but the second I tried to run, they grabbed me by my hair and started beating my head and back. 
'I remember shoes coming for my face and after that I heard other kids from the group saying, 'Yo chill, yo chill, it's just a girl,' and they pulled my attackers off me.' 
{snip} 
Temple has promised increased security, but when it comes to random street violence, anything can happen to anyone'“black or white.

Chicago 'Hits Back,' Strips Trump of Honorary Street Designation Fran Spielman, Chicago Sun-Times, October 25, 2016 
Chicago aldermen on Tuesday hit Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump where it hurts'“in his formidable ego'“for using a spike in homicides and shootings to paint a 'distorted caricature' of the city. 
The City Council's Transportation Committee unanimously agreed to strip Trump of a recognition he covets: 'Trump Plaza,' the honorary designation for the east side of Wabash Avenue between Illinois Street and the Chicago River, outside the 96-story Trump International Hotel & Tower. 
'We can actually use his own words against him: 'When you hit us, we hit back,' ' said Transportation Committee Chairman Anthony Beale (9th). 
'You've hit Chicago numerous times. . . . When you hit Chicago, Chicago hits back.' 
{snip} 
As for the honorary street designation, one of the Trump Plaza signs already has been stolen. So only one more needs to be removed. That will be done post-haste, if the full City Council approves the punishment, thanks to a so-called 'pending passage' letter that Beale promised to sign. 
Reilly said Trump no longer deserves the honor after making political hay at Chicago's expense in a way that has damaged the city's reputation on the global stage. 
Trump's decision to portray Chicago as a 'war zone' that needs stop-and-frisk during the first presidential debate was the final straw. 
'He was comparing us to a war-torn, third-world country. That was a set of comments that didn't just insult me. It insulted anyone who loves this great city,' Reilly said.

Don't Root, Root, Root for the Racist, Red-Face Team from Cleveland Paul Thornton, Los Angeles Times, October 26, 2016 
How I wish it were the Dodgers who took the field Tuesday night in Cleveland. Yes, we're all sad in Los Angeles that our team is now one year closer to celebrating the 30th anniversary of its last World Series appearance, but this goes beyond provincialism and wounded civil pride. 
The Dodgers deserved the chance to humiliate a Cleveland baseball team that not only persists in identifying itself as the 'Indians,' but also resurrected the laughably racist, red-faced mascot Chief Wahoo just in time for the playoffs. 
For those who haven't kept up with the baseball drama, here's a summary: The Cleveland team drew the curtain on its regular-season minstrel show in the spring, having replaced Chief Wahoo on its caps with a vintage red 'C.' It never officially retired the offending mascot, but Wahoo remained confined only to uniform sleeves throughout the regular season, leading reasonable people to believe that the team ownership had finally seen the light where other franchises such as the NFL's Washington Redskins remained defiantly in the dark, and was easing its fans into the post-'Indians' era. 
Or so we thought. Chief Wahoo reappeared when the Cleveland team began its impressive playoff run against the Boston Red Sox, and he hasn't left. He remained stitched on hats and held aloft by adoring Cleveland fans as the team convincingly defeated the Toronto Blue Jays, even surviving a legal attack by advocates of Canada's indigenous peoples that threatened to forbid even so much as the use of the term 'Indians' while the team was on Canadian soil. 
{snip} 
It's tempting to look past all this and take pity on a city that's had it as rough as Cleveland. The Cubs' championship drought has famously lasted for 107 baseball seasons, but the Cleveland team boasts a pitiable 67 years without a World Series title. Beyond sports, Cleveland's decline as an important American metropolis is arguably unmatched, having tumbled from a population peak of 900,000-plus in 1950 to less than 400,000 today. {snip} 
But Cleveland? Hey, I know some generous, wonderfully caring people from that part of Ohio, which makes wishing for their team's brutal defeat personally difficult. But being on the right side of a moral dispute isn't supposed to be easy, especially when the team in question isn't the evil Washington Redskins and its infernal owner, Daniel Snyder. Cleveland's municipal misery doesn't excuse the disgraceful exalting of Chief Wahoo any more than white men's economic hardship makes Donald Trump's popularity OK.

Students to Protest 'Mikado' for Lack of Engagement with Controversial Past Derek G. Xiao, Harvard Crimson, October 27, 2016 
A group of Asian American students is planning to protest the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players' upcoming production of 'The Mikado' for how it handles the racial stereotypes that characterize traditional performances of the opera. 
Organized by George S. Qiao '18, the group of students had publicized their protest over various email lists, describing what they consider inadequate attempts to remove the Japanese stereotypes and appropriation of Japanese culture that remained latent in the adapted production's storyline. But later Qiao said that he thought the tone of his initial concerns was unfair to the Players. 
'I fully believe that members of the Gilbert and Sullivan Players put their blood, sweat, and tears into trying to improve this staging of the production,' Qiao said. 'However, I believe that there is still insufficient critical engagement [with] this play's history of Japanese cultural misrepresentation.' 
Penned in 1884, 'The Mikado' is a comical opera, set in the fictional Japanese town of Titipu and meant to satirically mask criticism of British political culture and bureaucracy with grossly exaggerated 'Asian' names and stereotypical cultural caricatures. 
{snip} Hoping to avoid these issues in their own production, the board of the Gilbert and Sullivan Players made some changes to the setting and script of the opera, characterizing their rendition as a 'reimagining' of the original production. 
'The board of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players, whose mission is to produce the full canon of Gilbert and Sullivan's shows, faced a dilemma this past January,' Kathleen C. Zhou '17, the president of the Players, wrote in an op-ed for The Crimson Tuesday. 'Strike 'The Mikado' from our season, and ignore one of the most problematic but well-known G&S; shows, or try to confront it by reimagining it and subverting authorial intent.' 
The setting of their show is no longer the 19th century town of Titipu, and instead is now 20th century 'Las Vegas themed Oriental hotel.' And, the opening number 'Gentlemen of Japan' has been rewritten as 'Gentlemen of the Strip.' 
{snip} 
Zhou said in an interview that in rethinking the comical opera's script, the complete omission of all of the original production's issues was 'an erasure in itself in that it does not acknowledge how problematic the show has been to [Asians].'

Japan's Population Declines in 2015 for First Time Since 1920 Japan Times, October 27, 2016 
Japan's population stood at 127,094,745 as of Oct. 1, 2015, the final results of the census showed, down 0.8 percent from the previous census five years earlier and marking the first decline since the survey began in 1920. 
Of the total population, including non-Japanese residents, those aged 65 or older accounted for a record-high 26.6 percent, while those below 15 years old fell to a record-low 12.6 percent, the internal affairs ministry said. 
The government data showed that the number of people 65 or older rose 3.6 percentage points from the previous census in 2010 to 33,465,441. In contrast, those 14 or younger fell by 0.6 points to 15,886,810. 
Comparing the new census figures against U.N. estimates, Japan remains the 10th-most populous nation. However, among the top 20 countries, it was the only one whose population declined between 2010 and 2015. 
The latest results by the census, conducted every five years, also showed that the population is concentrated in Tokyo and its vicinity. 
Of the 47 prefectures, the capital and neighboring Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures accounted for 28.4 percent of the total population. 
The population rose only in eight prefectures'“the four above as well as Aichi, Shiga, Fukuoka and Okinawa. 
The population of Japanese nationals totaled 124,283,901, while the number of non-Japanese residents in the country totaled 1,752,368, the government data showed. 
By nationality, Chinese nationals accounted for the largest number of expatriates at 511,118, followed by people from both South Korea and North Korea together at 376,954. 
Of the country's 1,719 municipalities, the populations in 1,419 of them decreased, according to the census. 
The male population totaled 61,841,738, while the female population stood at 65,253,007. 
Tokyo had the lowest number of people in a household at 1.99, falling below 2 for the first time since the government began compiling such information in 1970, the data showed. The national average of members per household is 2.33. 
The preliminary figures for the census, released in February, showed the country's population fell by 947,305 from 128,057,352 in 2010.

Chinese Immigrants Demand Protection from Paris Muggers David Chazan, Telegraph, August 21, 2016 
Thousands of angry Chinese immigrants demonstrated in a Paris suburb yesterday (Sun) to demand police protection from muggers who they say prey on them because they are seen as easy targets. 
The death of a 49-year-old Chinese tailor after being badly beaten in a robbery earlier this month has lent new urgency to the long running complaint that Asian immigrants are systematically attacked and robbed in the French capital. 
'The Chinese community is dying in silence,' read a slogan on a T-shirt splashed with red to symbolise bloodstains worn by one demonstrator, Maike Song. 
He said he joined the protest in Aubervilliers to pay homage to Chaoling Zhang, the father of two who died on August 14 after being punched to ground in the north-eastern suburb that is home to some 4,000 Chinese immigrants. 
No arrests have been made over the attack. 
About 100 Chinese residents of Aubervilliers have been attacked and robbed since November, according to the Franco-Chinese Friendship Association. 
'It is because of prejudices that Chinese people are weak, docile and wealthy,' said Fang, a young female student. 'I've been attacked three times in three years and my friends are suffering the same thing. Some have moved away from this area because of it. I don't go out with a handbag any more.' 
Community workers say many muggings are committed by members of other minorities living in the area, generally of Arab or African origin. 
Paris officials corroborated the figures but declined to identify the robbers by ethnic origin. 
Many Chinese immigrants own restaurants or shops and tend to be relatively well-off, but are often reluctant to go to the police. 'Some victims have been illegal immigrants,' said Dominique Darden, a social worker. 
The Chinese community of Paris has held other protests in recent years over the attacks. 
'They happen almost every day because of poverty but it's unbearable,' said a spokesman, Olivier Wang. 'No one should have to put up with this.'

Facebook Lets Advertisers Exclude Users by Race Julia Angwin and Terry Parris Jr., Pro Publica, October 28, 2016 
Imagine if, during the Jim Crow era, a newspaper offered advertisers the option of placing ads only in copies that went to white readers. 
That's basically what Facebook is doing nowadays. 
The ubiquitous social network not only allows advertisers to target users by their interests or background, it also gives advertisers the ability to exclude specific groups it calls 'Ethnic Affinities.' Ads that exclude people based on race, gender and other sensitive factors are prohibited by federal law in housing and employment. 
{snip} 
The ad we purchased was targeted to Facebook members who were house hunting and excluded anyone with an 'affinity' for African-American, Asian-American or Hispanic people. ( Here's the ad itself .) 
When we showed Facebook's racial exclusion options to a prominent civil rights lawyer John Relman , he gasped and said, 'This is horrifying. This is massively illegal. This is about as blatant a violation of the federal Fair Housing Act as one can find.' 
The Fair Housing Act of 1968 makes it illegal 'to make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.' Violators can face tens of thousands of dollars in fines . 
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 also prohibits the 'printing or publication of notices or advertisements indicating prohibited preference, limitation, specification or discrimination' in employment recruitment. 
{snip} 
Facebook says its policies prohibit advertisers from using the targeting options for discrimination, harassment, disparagement or predatory advertising practices. 
'We take a strong stand against advertisers misusing our platform: Our policies prohibit using our targeting options to discriminate, and they require compliance with the law,' said Steve Satterfield, privacy and public policy manager at Facebook. 'We take prompt enforcement action when we determine that ads violate our policies.' 
{snip} 
He said Facebook began offering the 'Ethnic Affinity' categories within the past two years as part of a 'multicultural advertising' effort. 
Satterfield added that the 'Ethnic Affinity' is not the same as race'“which Facebook does not ask its members about. Facebook assigns members an 'Ethnic Affinity' based on pages and posts they have liked or engaged with on Facebook. 
When we asked why 'Ethnic Affinity' was included in the 'Demographics' category of its ad-targeting tool if it's not a representation of demographics, Facebook responded that it plans to move 'Ethnic Affinity' to another section. 
Facebook declined to answer questions about why our housing ad excluding minority groups was approved 15 minutes after we placed the order.

Posted on October 28, 2016 Media Self-Destruct over Trump Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, October 28, 2016 Their hysteria and dishonesty have backfired. 
From the start of Donald Trump's campaign, the media have covered him dishonestly. They have consistently portrayed him as a closet 'white supremacist' who deliberately appeals to 'racists.' They have tried to tie him to a wicked movement known as the 'Alt-Right.' They are now working on another dishonest angle: that Donald Trump is 'mainstreaming hate' and bringing 'racism' into public discourse. The media clearly want to stampede voters into Mrs. Clinton's camp so as to spare us the agony of a 'racist' in the White House. 
The demonization campaign has backfired. By trying to hang racial dissidents around Donald Trump's neck, the media have given American Renaissance and other organizations far more publicity than ever before. At the same time, constant shouts of 'racist' and 'bigot' don't seem to hurt Mr. Trump: instead they are wrecking what is left of media credibility. The biggest irony, though, is that Donald Trump is probably not one of us at all. But even small deviations from the cast-iron orthodoxy of race are enough to plunge our rulers into dark fantasies about Donald Trump as a secret David Duke fan. 
Media dishonesty started immediately. When Mr. Trump pointed out that some immigrants from Mexico were criminals, the press acted as if he had said all Mexican immigrants are criminals. Then, when alert news hounds discovered that those of us they love to call 'haters' and 'white supremacists' liked Mr. Trump, there was no end of articles with titles such as: ' Meet the Horde of Neo-Nazis, Klansmen, and Other Extremist Leaders Endorsing Donald Trump ,' ' Top Racists And Neo-Nazis Back Donald Trump ,' ' 'Heil Donald Trump': Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists Show Support ,' and ' The White Nationalists Who Support Donald Trump .' 
These articles had a simpleminded purpose: discredit Mr. Trump by parading before the reader any Nazi, Kluxer, or racially conscious white person who had anything nice to say about the candidate. The implication was that if 'racists' were going to vote for Donald Trump he must be 'racist,' too. 
This was deceitful and one-sided. When the chairman of the American Communist Party endorsed Hillary Clinton , no one suggested this meant she was a communist. 
It is true that Mr. Trump gave the media just enough of an excuse to pretend he really is a closet 'bigot' because he did not repudiate 'racists' with the snorts of indignation respectability requires. There was the famous exchange in February when a reporter pushed Mr. Trump to disavow an endorsement from David Duke. As The Hill reported it: ' 'David Duke endorsed me? OK, alright. I disavow, OK?' Trump said, seeking to quickly move on to another question.' 
That same month, there was another famous exchange with Jake Tapper of CNN : 
Tapper : Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don't want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election? 
Donald Trump : Well just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke, OK? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don't know. I don't know, did he endorse me, or what's going on? Because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. 
The media leaped on these exchanges with shouts of joy. 'Trump refuses to disavow white supremacists! That's because he is one!' 
There are far better explanations. First, Donald Trump is a pugnacious man. He doesn't like being pushed around by anyone, especially not by journalists who hate him. If Mr. Tapper had belligerently demanded that Mr. Trump agree that the sky is blue, Mr. Trump would have bridled at that. 
Second, Donald Trump probably doesn't know anything about David Duke or white supremacy. I would be astonished if he has ever looked into the thinking of David Duke or any other alleged 'white supremacist.' It is his feistiness and his ignorance of white advocacy that explain his answers, not some carefully concealed racial consciousness. 
The press has also pounced on Donald Trump's retweets of 'racist' material, which is supposed to be yet more proof that he is a secret supremacist. Business Insider, for example, published this shocking story: ' 5 times Donald Trump has engaged with alt-right racists on Twitter .' Not one of these tweets is obviously 'racist,' and it would be surprising if Mr. Trump or his skeleton staff took the time to vet the sources of the thousands of tweets @realDonaldTrump has sent during the campaign. 
Now the press is working on another smear-Trump angle. Recently, I have been contacted by journalists from such places as Bloomberg News, Reuters, and the New York Times , who clearly want to write that Donald Trump is 'mainstreaming hate,' that he is responsible for a huge surge in the Alt-Right. They want to know about all the people who have been flocking to AmRen.com because of what Donald Trump says. They want me to tell them about people who have been 'emboldened' to 'speak out against minorities' because Donald Trump has led the way. They would love to find someone who now thinks he is free to run down the street shouting 'nigger!' because Mr. Trump wants to take a hard look at Muslim immigrants. 
I have explained to them as patiently as I can that they have it the wrong way around. No one comes looking for AmRen.com because Donald Trump wants to build a wall. They come looking for us because the media have written about us in their attempt to convince the world that Mr. Trump is a 'racist.' They come looking for us because Mrs. Clinton kindly called attention to us by complaining about the Alt-Right and her 'basket of deplorables.' I also try to explain that if the media had not launched its malicious campaign of trying to hold Donald Trump responsible for the views of certain people who support him, few people would have heard of the Alt-Right. In their zeal to paint their enemy in the darkest colors, they are promoting the Alt-Right, not Donald Trump. 
I explain that racial dissent has been growing like never before, for reasons that have nothing to do with the campaign. It is Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Black Lives Matters, and black rioters who are sending hundreds of thousands of frustrated white people our way'“ not Donald Trump. This will not change whether Mr. Trump wins or loses. The top landing pages on AmRen.com are analyses of race and crime'“something Mr. Trump never talks about. 
I also explain to reporters that it is idiotic to think Mr. Trump has mainstreamed 'hate,' by which they mean sensible observations about race. I ask them to name a single person who has been 'emboldened' to say something 'racist' just because Donald Trump is the GOP nominee. Of course, they can't. If anything, it is the opposite. Mr. Trump has been called every name under the sun for the mildest, most common-sense observations about Muslims and immigration. Anyone tempted to come out of the closet is likely to hesitate more than ever. Things could change if Mr. Trump becomes president, but the candidate himself has done very little to spread our ideas. 
What Donald Trump has done is spark an unprecedented interest in politics among disaffected young people who recognize that Mitt Romney and John McCain are no different from Barack Obama when it comes to preserving whites, their society, and their culture. I know a number of millennials who never bothered to vote before but who certainly will in November. I know some who have made their first political contribution or who have spent weekends volunteering for the Trump campaign. 
I point out to reporters that this is what elections are supposed to be all about: giving the voters real choices. I note that the Trump/Clinton contest will almost certainly produce a record voter turnout for a modern election. Haven't our rulers been wringing their hands over a lack of political engagement, especially among the young? Well, now they have engagement, alright, but they don't like it. They don't like it because so many people are stumping for the candidate they love to call a ' threat to democracy .' Liberals are such transparent hypocrites. They claim to love democracy, but suddenly start worrying about its health if the people refuse vote the way they tell them to. 
The whole Trump-is-a-racist fracas shows just how painfully fragile orthodoxy has become. I may be wrong, but I have no reason to think Donald Trump thinks at all as we do. He has never said or done anything to suggest he is anything more than an ordinary American with normal instincts: He doesn't want criminals sneaking across the border, he thinks sanctuary cities for illegals are crazy, he doesn't see why we need more Muslims, and he is angry when immigrants go on welfare. Millions of ordinary Americans clearly agree with him, and not because they are racially aware. It is because they are decent, fair-minded people who also have a nagging sense that the country is changing in unwelcome ways. 
I am convinced that Mr. Trump does not have a sophisticated understanding of race. So far as I can tell, he doesn't have a sophisticated understanding of much of anything. He has stumbled by instinct onto a few sensible policies that white advocates have been promoting for a long time, but not because he is one of us. 
Maybe'“just maybe'“he will move in our direction. It's not impossible to imagine a President Trump asking, in an offhand way, 'What's wrong with white people wanting to remain a majority in the United States?' Or he might casually note that you can't expect as many blacks as Asians in AP classes because they don't have the same levels of intelligence. But I can imagine the opposite, too: President Trump so bogged down in Beltway baloney that he never even builds the wall. 
There is one thing that Donald Trump has changed. He has proven that Republican bromides about taxes and small government don't excite people. He has proven that there is tremendous anger against political insiders of both parties. He has proven that Americans do want their country to come first. They don't want it to try to save the world or to be a dumping ground for people who have wrecked their own countries. 
And even if he has not 'mainstreamed racism,' he has shown that if you have a backbone you can withstand what is surely the most intense and concentrated program of hate ever directed at an American. On October 11, Roger Cohen wrote in the New York Times that Donald Trump is a 'phony, liar, blowhard, cheat, bully, misogynist, demagogue, predator, bigot, bore, egomaniac, racist, sexist, sociopath,' and a 'dictator-in-waiting with a brat's temper and a prig's scowl.' This must be one of the most unhinged, hysterical outbursts in the history of American political journalism. And it is unusual only for its wordiness, not its tone. 
Don't the editors of the Times realize that this kind of frothing explains why more Americans believe in Bigfoot (29 percent) than trust newspapers (20 percent)? Virtually the entire industry is so consumed with rage at Donald Trump and contempt for his supporters that it cannot control itself. Open, petulant bias is driving more and more Americans to social media and to sites like AmRen.com for their news. 
Despite the concerted shrieking of virtually the entire American ruling class, Donald Trump is going to get close to half of the vote on November 8. Some 60 million people are going to vote for a man for whom Roger Cohen has emptied his dictionary trying to insult. Only one major newspaper has endorsed Donald Trump. Only one . And this is a man whom the American people might choose as their president. What better proof could we have of the stark difference between printed opinion and public opinion, between what Americans think and what our rulers want us to think? Donald Trump has ripped away whatever was left of the pretense of media objectivity. 
Whether he wins or not, whether he is one of us or not, Donald Trump has laid bare the collusion between big media and a political system in which both parties collaborate to run the country in their interests and those of their big donors. Voters'“finally'“have a chance to vote against the entire corrupt system. On November 8th they could bring it crashing down, but even if it still stands, it is visibly weakened, badly discredited.

Some Cities Want Their Noncitizen Immigrants to Vote Caroline Winter, Bloomberg Businessweek, October 28, 2016 
'Look at illegal immigrants voting all over the country,' Donald Trump recently claimed in a Fox News interview, part of his ongoing effort to cast doubt on the integrity of the presidential election. There's no evidence to support the Republican nominee's claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include noncitizens. 
The latest is San Francisco, where the Nov. 8 ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the city's public schools to vote in school board elections. The right would be extended to those with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all. 'One out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesn't have a voice,' says San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, the son of Taiwanese immigrants. 'We've had legal immigrants who've had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.' Undocumented immigrants should also have the right, Chiu adds, to bypass the 'broken immigration system in this country.'

Today there are six jurisdictions in Maryland that let noncitizens vote in local elections. Chicago allows them to take part in elected parent advisory councils but not to vote in school board elections. Four towns in Massachusetts have moved to allow noncitizen voting and are awaiting state approval. And in New York City, where noncitizens make up 21 percent of the voting-age population, the city council is drafting legislation that would allow more than 1.3 million legal residents to take part in municipal elections. The city previously allowed noncitizens to vote in school board elections, but that ended when New York's school boards were dissolved in 2002.

Illinois Senator Draws Fire for Racially Charged Attack on Opponent's Family Alexandra Jaffe and Traci G. Lee, NBC News, October 28, 2016 
Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk is again under fire for making racially-charged comments, this time for questioning the military service of his Democratic opponent's family. 
During Thursday night's debate between Kirk and challenger Rep. Tammy Duckworth, Duckworth spoke about her desire to be in the Senate as a voice of reason and referenced her family's history of service, saying, 'My family has served this nation in uniform, going back to the Revolution. I'm a daughter of the American Revolution. I've bled for this nation. But I still want to be there in the Senate when the drums of war sound. Because people are quick to sound the drums of war, and I want to be there to say this is what it costs, this is what you're asking us to do. . . . Families like mine are the ones that bleed first.' 
Kirk responded: 'I had forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.' Tammy Duckworth is a vet who lost both legs in Iraq. Her family has served since the Revolutionary War. And yet'¦ pic.twitter.com/DHd3kWrUsN

Though Duckworth, who was born in Thailand to a Thai mother of Chinese descent and an American father, did not respond on the stage, she tweeted a photo after the debate of herself with her parents'“her father displaying medals of service on his coat. 'My mom is an immigrant and my dad and his family have served this nation in uniform since the Revolution,' Duckworth wrote. 
Duckworth's late father, Franklin, served in World War II and has 'traced his lineage back to an ancestor who fought in the American Revolution,' according to a 2012 Mother Jones profile on Duckworth's run for Congress.

On Friday, Kirk tried to tamp down the backlash and tweeted 'sincere apologies to an American hero.' 
It's not the first time the Illinois senator has courted controversy with racially-charged comments'“he previously said President Obama was 'acting like the drug dealer in chief' for the administration's cash payment to Iran in exchange for the release of American prisoners, and talked about fostering opportunities for African-American entrepreneurs so 'that the black community is not the one we drive faster through.'

Go Back to Where You Claim Home,' Kansas Lawmaker Tells Protester Dion Lefler, Wichita Eagle, October 25, 2016 
Kansas state Rep. Joe Seiwert commented on Facebook that an African-American singer who knelt while performing 'The Star Spangled Banner' at a Miami Heat game should 'go back' to where she claims as home. 
Seiwert, R-Pretty Prairie, posted that comment and a longer follow-up on an anti-black meme that was originally posted to a pro-Donald Trump Facebook group and then shared by one of Seiwert's constituents. 
Seiwert confirmed the comments were his and said he was exercising his First Amendment right to free speech, as he says the woman in the meme did when she wore a Black Lives Matter T-shirt and knelt while singing the anthem. 
{snip} 
The photo in the meme is of Denasia Lawrence, a Miami social worker and, according to the Miami Sun-Sentinel, a part-time game-night employee of the Heat professional basketball team. The team has issued a statement saying team officials were unaware that Lawrence planned to protest when they asked her to sing the anthem at Friday's preseason game with the Philadelphia 76ers. 
{snip} 
To which Seiwert responded: 'I am where I claim home and like it, they want to claim it and it is their right to go where ever they like, so if they don't like it here, I believe that their freedom completely allows them to go wherever they believe is more free and non racist if that's what they believe.' 
Seiwert said he didn't see the profanity in the meme when he commented and didn't do anything wrong. 
'I have a personal life besides a legislative life,' he said. 'Maybe it was inappropriate; I don't believe so, because I said nothing derogatory. And I believe that (if) people are that upset with the national anthem, they can do whatever they want to on their own time, but when they're using it on national TV to make a statement, that's not right. 
'I said if she (Lawrence) doesn't like it here, then go where she would like it. What's wrong with that?' he said. 
Asked why a person should leave rather than try to change things where they are, Seiwert responded: 'Because maybe there's other people who don't want their place changed.' 
He also said he did not think his comments had anything to do with race. 
'It don't make any difference if they're black, white or green, it's the disrespect to our country,' he said. 'And why does everybody put the color to it?' 
{snip} 
The person who made the meme took a photo of Lawrence from the web and added, in capital letters, 'KNEELING WHILE SINGING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM . . . I'M SO SICK OF THESE ANTI-AMERICAN BLACKS . . . (Expletive) BLACK LIVES MATTER.' 
Seiwert's comment, directed at Lawrence, was: 'Go back to where you claim home than (sic).'

Rancher Yearns for Trump Wall on US-Mexico Border AFP, October 28, 2016 
To many, Donald Trump's pledge to build a wall along the US-Mexico border is unrealistic. But for Jim Chilton, it's the only way he'll get a good night's sleep. 
The 77-year-old, a fifth-generation rancher on the Arizona border with Mexico, says he has grown weary of seeing drug smugglers'“rather than just cattle'“on his ranch and a wall is the answer to his troubles. 
'I really admire Trump for having the insight and the knowledge to know what's wrong with the current border system,' he said, as he surveyed the sprawling desert plains of his 75-square-mile ranch that stretches to the Mexican border. 
'We need a wall. I've been saying that for 10 years . . . and we need roads along the boundary and the border patrol to be deployed there and not let anybody in,' he added. 'It would make my life so much better and I'd feel more secure.' 
{snip} 
Chilton, who admits that Trump was not his first choice among the Republican candidates for the White House, says building a barrier to secure the 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) US-Mexico frontier not only makes sense but is also a question of national security. 
{snip} 
'I live in a no-man's land. I live in a land that is occupied by the Sinaloa drug cartel,' he sighed, pointing to mountains on his ranch where he said scouts equipped with sophisticated equipment are posted as lookouts for smugglers. 
'I have seen cartel scouts on these two mountains before . . . and even in my front yard,' he said. 'I wave at them and they often yell 'hola' and wave back.' 
Chilton'“who keeps a gun holstered on his hip, a rifle by his front door and a pistol by his bedside'“added that he and other ranchers are also in favor of beefed up security in remote border areas as extremist groups like Islamic State (IS) may be using them to slip operatives into the United States. 
{snip} 
But beyond the drug cartels and threat of terrorism, Chilton insists that Trump's wall is all the more necessary for humanitarian reasons. 
'It's just outrageous for me to find a dead body on my ranch. It's outrageous for the border patrol to find a dead body and it's outrageous for my cowboys,' he said, referring to migrants who often die making the crossing into the US through the brutal desert. 
'This is as big a humanitarian issue as it is a national security issue.' 
{snip} 
According to the US Border Patrol, nearly 2,600 bodies have been recovered since 1998 from the desert in the Tucson, Arizona sector which covers 262 miles of the border.

49ers Fans Care More About Victories Than Kaepernick Elliott Almond, Mercury News, October 24, 2016 
Colin Kaepernick's first home start in a year didn't stop the pessimism that has left red-jerseyed 49ers' patrons in a football funk. 
Thousands of empty red seats at Levi's Stadium underscored San Francisco's freefall that continued unabated Sunday in a 34-17 defeat to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
Few were thinking about Kaepernick's season-long activism in which he again kneeled during the national anthem to protest oppression against minorities. These days, fans just want to see their team win a game after six consecutive defeats. 
{snip} 
After leading the 49ers to a promising 14-0 first-quarter lead, Kaepernick and the offense sputtered. He completed just 16 of 34 passes for 134 yards with one touchdown and one interception. 
Kaepernick's scrambling'“he led the team with 84 rushing yards on nine carries'“and occasional flashes of accurate downfield passing, weren't enough, even with the 49ers firmly in the game midway through the fourth quarter. 
{snip} 
Kaepernick donned a T-shirt Sunday paying tribute to the Black Panther Party, an Oakland activist group that celebrated its 50th anniversary this weekend. The quarterback said the shirt was a gift from his girlfriend, MTV host Nessa Diab. 
Last week, he wore a shirt with Muhammad Ali's face before the game at Buffalo. 
Kaepernick's protest against police shootings of unarmed African Americans has been divisive because some say it is disrespectful to veterans. A recent survey by Yahoo Sports and YouGov found that a decline in NFL ratings partially is attributed to the quarterback's action. 
'I don't know much about ratings and how they are affected,' he said in a postgame interview. 'But I don't understand why ratings would go down fighting for justice for people, to try to stop oppression, especially in the league that is predominately black.'

Dutch Anti-Islam MP Wilders to Snub Hate Speech Trial AFP, October 28, 2016 
Defiant Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders said Friday he will refuse to attend his hate speech trial next week, dubbing it a travesty aimed at silencing him as the country prepares for 2017 elections. 
The trial opens on Monday before a three-judge bench with the far-right politician facing charges of insulting a racial group and inciting racial hatred for comments he made about Moroccans living in the Netherlands. 
'It is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country,' Wilders said in a statement Friday, dubbing the case 'a political trial, in which I refuse to cooperate'. 
It comes as opinion polls have shown his far-right Freedom Party (PVV) doing well ahead of March elections. 
After riding high amid the migrant crisis, the party is now polling neck-and-neck with Prime Minister Mark Rutte's Liberals each predicted to win between 25 to 29 seats in the 150-seat parliament. 
Set to last until November 25, the trial focuses on a comment made at a March 2014 rally when Wilders asked supporters if they wanted 'fewer or more Moroccans in your city and in the Netherlands?' 
When the crowd shouted back 'Fewer! Fewer!' Wilders answered: 'We're going to organise that.' 
{snip} 
Wilders said Friday he would leave his defence in the hands of his lawyer Geert-Jan Knoops and instead 'go to work' in the parliament in The Hague. 
{snip} 
Judges earlier this month dismissed arguments by Wilders' lawyers that the trial was 'politically motivated' adding they did not believe it will impact the PVV's election campaign. 
Politicians 'are granted broad freedoms of expression because of their official position,' the judges ruled last month. 
'Precisely therefore politicians have an important role to avoid feeding intolerance by making these kind of public statements.' 
Wilders hit back Friday saying 'it is a travesty that I have to stand trial because I spoke about fewer Moroccans.' 
'Millions of Dutch citizens (43 percent of the population) want fewer Moroccans,' he claimed. 
'Not because they despise all Moroccans or want all Moroccans out of the country, but because they are sick and tired of the nuisance and terror caused by so many Moroccans.'

More Migrants Pitch Tents on Paris Streets as Calais Camp Shuts Ingrid Melander, Reuters, October 28, 2016 
The number of migrants sleeping rough on the streets of Paris has risen by at least a third since the start of the week when the 'Jungle' shanty town in Calais was evacuated, officials said on Friday. 
Along the bustling boulevards and a canal in a northeastern corner of Paris, hundreds of tents have been pitched by migrants'“mostly Africans who say they are from Sudan'“with cardboard on the ground to try and insulate them from the autumn chill. 
While the presence of migrants there is not new, it has grown substantially this week, Colombe Brossel, Paris deputy mayor in charge of security issues, told Reuters. 
'We have seen a big increase since the start of the week. Last night, our teams counted 40 to 50 new tents there in two days,' Brossel said, adding there was now a total of 700 to 750. 
This means there are some 2,000-2,500 sleeping in the area, up from around 1,500 a few days before, she said. 
{snip} 
After years as serving as an illegal base camp for migrants trying to get to Britain, the 'Jungle' at Calais was finally bulldozed this week and the more than 6,000 residents of the ramshackle camp near the English channel were relocated to shelters around France.

Ama, a 24-year-old Sudanese who is six months pregnant, said she had come to Paris from Calais, but that was months ago. 
'I was in Calais before but I did not find the route (to Britain),' she said. 'I couldn't stay over there being pregnant, it was too hard.' 
Deputy Mayor Brossel said it was up to the central government, and not city authorities, to act. 
'These people must be sheltered,' she said.

Lukas Mikelionis, Heat Street, October 24, 2016 
{snip} According to Misao Dean, Professor of English at the University of Victoria, the canoe can be a symbol of colonialism, imperialism and genocide due to history. She also accused the canoers of cultural appropriation because they are primarily white men and have a privileged place in society. 
In a radio interview for CBC Radio , which wasn't picked up by the Internet until several months later, she claimed 'we have a whole set of narratives that make the canoe into a kind of morally untouchable symbol, something that seems natural, that seems ordinary, and seems to promote values that we ascribe to.' 
'But I think if you look a little further that narrative obscures or erases another narrative'“and that narrative is about, to be blunt, it's about theft and genocide', the professor said.

'It's not a coincidence that it was white men of a certain age . . . Certainly the majority of wilderness canoers are people who have a very privileged place in society. They're frequently highly educated people. They're almost completely white,' she said. 
CBC Radio host Jim Brown then asked a question: 'Should we look at the canoe as a non-controversial symbol or should we look at it as a symbol of colonialism?' 
To which the academic replied: 'Absolutely a symbol of colonialism. It seems to me that this narrative we tell ourselves about the canoe about how canoeing makes us in touch with nature, how canoeing makes us in some way guiltless of the terrible things that the Canadian government and Canadians in general did to First Nations people.'

Posted on October 28, 2016 The Chinese Who Saw the Perils of Westernization Sacco Vandal, American Renaissance, October 28, 2016 They cautioned their countrymen 100 years ago. 
Many Westerners fear the decline of their own society while they foresee Chinese ascension and impending dominance'“with alternating tones of fear or enthusiasm. The United States is growing demographically and may remain a viable cultural entity, but the consensus is that Europe faces demographic disaster. China and the West seem to be approaching an inversion of their relationship of just over a century ago, during the late Qing period, when the West was dominant and China was peripheral. [1] 
Patrick Buchanan described the Western dilemma in 2008: 
What happened to us? What happened to our world? When the twentieth century opened, the West was everywhere supreme. For four hundred years, explorers, missionaries, conquerors, and colonizers departed from Europe for the four corners of the Earth to erect empires that were to bring the blessings and benefits of Western civilization to all mankind. . . . Whatever became of those men? Somewhere in the last century, Western man suffered a catastrophic loss of faith'“in himself, in his civilization, and in the faith that gave it birth. [2] 
Although the United States remains the strongest'“but not the sole'“superpower, European peoples are in decline everywhere. In another book, Mr. Buchanan points out that 'In 1960, people of European ancestry were one-fourth of the world's population; in 2000, they were one-sixth; in 2050, they will be one-tenth. These are the statistics of a vanishing race.' [3] Mr. Buchanan is hardly the first to warn of impending doom for the West. The lamentations of Oswald Spengler (1880'“1936) are well known. Less known, however, are the Chinese from the same period who dreamed of a resurgence for China and warned of Western decline. These voices from the late Qing Dynasty may now seem prescient. 
Spengler saw the First World War as a sign of the West's inevitable decline. Many of the Chinese literati who had at first been smitten with the dynamism of the West also came to see the war in the same way: Western civilization was in a state of crisis that would lead to its destruction. Today, Mr. Buchanan also calls the First World War a 'mortal wound' that was 'inflicted upon our civilization.' [4] Meanwhile, the Chinese, who have resurrected many of the tenets of their traditional civilization after decades of Maoist rule, argue that Western liberalization and democratization are not the True Way by which they will inherit the Earth. As China begins to return to traditional Chinese pragmatism and the West implodes, certain late Qing intellectuals now appear vindicated. Devastation after WWI. 
First among them were Yan Fu (1854'“1921) and Liang Qichao (1873'“1929). The dynamism of the West at first impressed them, leading them to promote Westernization in China. However, by the end of their lives, both men had come to see the dynamism of the West as self-destructive. They exhorted China to take a middle path between traditionalism and modernization, hoping that this might by the key to supplanting the West. 
China in trouble 
In the latter half of the 19th century, China was at a technological and military disadvantage. It lost a series of wars with Western powers and was forced to accept unequal treaties. This led various ministers of the Qing Dynasty, such as Li Hongzhang (1823'“1901) to advocate mild forms of modernization. Meanwhile, the Meiji government in Japan had started an ambitious effort of full-scale Westernization beginning in 1868. And in 1895, after Japan defeated China in the Sino-Japanese War, it became obvious to most Chinese intellectuals that their nation's program of limited modernization was not enough. 
Until the mid 19th century, Europe had been an inconsequential backwater for China. As late as 1793, a British attempt to establish a greater amount of trade with the Qing was rebuffed with the assertion by the Qianlong emperor (1711'“1799) that China 'possesses all things in prolific abundance and lacks no products within its own borders,' and thus had 'no need to import the manufactures of outside barbarians.' [5] By the mid 19th century, industrialization had made the West vastly more rich and powerful. However, some Chinese thought the sudden dynamism of the West also had intellectual origins. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, China found itself at the mercy of the Western powers that it once looked down upon. 
Darwin's dangerous idea 
In 1895, Yan Fu was superintendent of the Beiyang Naval School. In an explanation of Western civilization to fellow Chinese intellectuals, he focused on the theory of evolution. As a young man, he had studied in England and become familiar with social Darwinism, and came to see it as the cultural fountainhead of wealth and power. 'Since the publication of [Darwin's The Origin of Species ],' wrote Yan, 'of which nearly every household in Europe and America now has a copy, there has been a tremendous change in the scholarship, politics, and religion of the West. The claim that the revolution in outlook and intellectual orientation occasioned by Darwin's book exceeds that of Newtonian astronomy is hardly an empty one.' [6] Yan spent the next ten years translating works on English evolutionist thought by men such as Herbert Spencer (1820'“1903) and Thomas Huxley (1825'“1895) in the hope of converting his colleagues to social Darwinism. Yan Fu was attracted to social Darwinism while studying in England. 
Perhaps it took an outsider to see the power of evolutionary thought. Darwin's theory shook Westerners but it also gave them a certain will to power. Herbert Spencer, who coined the term 'survival of the fittest,' led the transformation of Darwinism into social Darwinism, which called upon Western man to glorify victory in social competition. Victory in competition was the purpose of all life everywhere. 
Yan quickly saw the winning-at-all-costs ruthlessness of social Darwinism as a remedy for China. Writing in his work on Yan's life, Benjamin Schwartz writes: 
What interests [Yan] is not so much the Darwinian account of biological evolution qua science. It is precisely the stress on the values of struggle'“assertive energy, the emphasis on the actualization of potentialities within a competitive situation. The image of 'nature red in tooth and claw' does not depress him. It exhilarates him. [7] 
Yan nevertheless worried that it might be too late for China to adopt social Darwinism, and that his country would be overwhelmed by the nations that had. In a 1895 newspaper essay, 'On Strength,' he wrote: 
Months and years slip by, and with rapacious neighbors all around, I fear that we will be too late, that we will follow Poland and India, providing an example of Darwin's [elimination] before we have been able to implement Spencer's methods. . . . Alas, our individual lives are not worth the worry, but what of our descendants, and the 400,000,000 of our race? [8] 
The battle for reform 
After defeat in the Sino-Japanese war, many Chinese intellectuals, such as Yan, began to advocate full-scale Westernization. Japan had already adopted social Darwinism in its pursuit of Western wealth and power, and the Chinese intelligentsia began to believe that China should follow suit. In 1898, the Guangxu emperor (1871'“1908) appointed the minister Kang Youwei (1858'“1927) to head a reform movement after Kang had requested permission to imitate Japan: 
As to the republican governments of the United States and France and the constitutional governments of Britain and Germany, these countries are far away and their customs are different from ours. Their changes occurred a long time ago and can no longer be traced. Consequently I beg Your Majesty. . . to take the Meiji Reform of Japan as the model for our reform. The time and place of Japan's reform are not remote and her religion and customs are somewhat similar to ours. Her success is manifest; her example can easily be followed. [9] 
The emperor agreed, and the minister initiated a flurry of Meiji-style reform. A bright young man named Liang Qichao worked with Kang as his protÃ©gÃ©, and he became one of the most influential Chinese advocates for Westernization. However, Kang and Liang's efforts were quickly aborted after an imperial coup under the Empress Dowager Cixi (1835'“1908). Liang Qichao 
After the Empress Dowager cut short what later became known as the Hundred Days Reform, Kang and Liang escaped political persecution by fleeing to Japan. Once there, Kang continued to support the Qing dynasty and to justify an agenda for Chinese reform via cautious appeals to Confucianism. Liang, however, ultimately broke with Kang and'“like Yan'“began to espouse 'a new view of world history strongly colored by social Darwinism: a struggle for survival among nations and races.' [10] 
He wrote: 
If we wish to make our nation strong, we must investigate extensively the methods followed by other nations in becoming independent. We should select the superior points and appropriate them to make up for our own shortcomings. [11] 
Liang increasingly came to see social Darwinism as the fuel of the West's dynamism, one of the 'superior points' that China would do well to 'appropriate.' Writing from Japan, he exerted great influence on young Chinese. Together, Yan and Liang instilled in an entire generation of Chinese students a fervent desire for change. But this influence did not bring social Darwinism to China. Instead, it brought the 1911 Revolution, the New Cultural Movement (1915'“1921), and the May Fourth Movement of 1919'“perturbations that would spin China into over half a century of upheaval. 
Accommodative versus transformative thought 
Despite their attraction to social Darwinism and their sometimes radical calls for reform, Yan and Liang were not revolutionaries. Indeed, although Liang and'“especially'“Yan attacked various instances of Chinese backwardness, they continued to support the Qing Dynasty, advocating slow transition into a constitutional monarchy based on the British model. Once the 1911 Revolution succeeded, however, Liang grudgingly threw his support behind the new republican government, but Yan continued to support monarchy. 
Questioning the West 
The First World War was a shock to reformers who wanted to embrace the West. As the war dragged on, aging reformers such as Yan and Liang became increasingly disillusioned with not only transformative revolution, but Westernization and even the West. Yan wrote that the carnage of the war was a consequence of Western traits: 'Such has been the effect on the human race of civilization and science! When I look back on our [Chinese] sacred wisdom and culture, I find that it foresaw this even at that early date. . .' [12] 
Yan explained further: 
As I have grown older and have observed the seven years of republican government in China and the four years of bloody war in Europe'“a war such as the world has never known'“I have come to feel that [the West's] progress . . . has lead only to selfishness, slaughter, corruption, and shamelessness. When I look back upon the ways of Confucius and Mencius, I find that they . . . have profoundly benefited the realm. This is not my opinion alone. Many thinking people in the West have gradually come to feel this way. [13] 
Liang wrote that 'recently many Western scholars have wanted to import Asian civilization as a corrective to their own,' and, indeed, the latter half of the 20th century saw the importation of philosophical, religious, and cultural curiosities from the East and into the West. In the meantime he stated his goal for China: 
I therefore hope that our dear young people will, first of all, have a sincere purpose of respecting and protecting our civilization; second, that they will apply Western methods to the study of our civilization and discover its true character; third, that they will put our own civilization in order and supplement it with others' so that it will be transformed and become a new civilization; and fourth, that they will extend this new civilization to the outside world so that it can benefit the whole human race. [14] 
Because of the devastation of the First World War, these two thinkers who had once promoted modernization and Westernization instead advocated a modernization without Westernization (or at least minimal Westernization). They seemed to believe that the course of the West was not sustainable and that the West could be supplanted by China if it modernized in a way that was compatible with its nature and culture. They seem to have realized that social Darwinism was a false promise, and that the forces it unleashed could destroy the West. 
China and the West today 
In the end, China did not follow Japan down the path of Westernization. A burgeoning Chinese nationalism grew up around anti-Japanese sentiment, and this enmity was extended to the West after Japan instead of China was awarded Germany's Chinese concession at Versailles in 1919. Ultimately, communism on the Soviet model provided the Chinese with an alternative to both Chinese traditionalism and the West. China entered a period of socialist tyranny under Mao Zedong (1893'“1976). 
After Mao's death, China began to abandon Maoism. It is still nominally communist, but since the 1980's, it has followed the example of Hong Kong and Taiwan and has increasingly returned to the teachings of Confucius and Mencius. Chinese now praise Yan and Liang for their wisdom and prescience. The post-Mao leadership of the People's Republic of China'“beginning with Deng Xiaoping'“has espoused views nearly identical to those advocated by Liang over a century ago. [15] Statue of Liang Qichao in Tianjin. 
At the same time, Westerners are now studying the warnings of Yan and Liang about the inherent instability of the West. As Western liberals such as Martin Jacques herald the coming Chinese domination, there may be a generation of European and American scholars who find themselves in a position similar to that of Yan and Liang: struggling to understand why their civilization has fallen behind that of a rival whose inferiority was once taken for granted. 
Thus, while China has found its way back to the middle path, balancing its modernization and Westernization with pragmatism, caution, and Confucianism, the West is disintegrating in a chaos of heterogeneity and decadence. The warnings of Spengler have come true, and Patrick Buchanan forecasts the death of the West. Russia and parts of Eastern Europe are trying to save themselves from liberalism and democracy, but success is not guaranteed. 
Thinkers in the Alt-Right are wrestling with the question of how to save our own white civilization. The old order is collapsing due to challenges from abroad and the immigrant invasion. Non-whites are chopping up the West the way the West once chopped up China. We are Yan Fu and Liang Qichao. We must forge a plan for the preservation of our race.

War With the Comanche Duncan Hengest, American Renaissance, July 2010 
Fort Sill, north of Lawton, Oklahoma, is home to the Army's Field Artillery School as well as many field artillery brigades. Over the decades, thousands of Americans have learned how to crew cannon there, and I am one of them. A posting to Fort Sill allowed me to explore what remains of the Wild West when I was off duty. I'd always been a fan of Westerns and of the real history of America's pioneering conquest of the continent, and the Lawton area was and is the center of Comanche territory. 
During the early days of the Texas Republic, the Comanche were the world's best light cavalry. In fact, they were such fantastic fighters that the Spanish never even tried to subdue them, and the Comanche halted the expansion of settlements into the panhandle and northern Texas for nearly 50 years. Yet the Comanche today are a pitiful group, the defeated remnants of a terrible racial conflict. 
Everywhere you go in Lawton, you see obese Indians. In Oklahoma each tribe has its own license plates, so you can tell a person's tribe by watching him get into his car. (I tried to get a license plate that said 'Comanche' but the DMV would not give me one.) Sometimes it seems as though all the Comanche are unhealthy; the white man's diet does not seem suited to a people adapted to living on game from the North American prairie. When the Comanche get sick they go to the Public Health Service Indian Hospital at the eastern end of Lawton. If you drive by you are likely to see ancient Indians '” poor and disheveled '” holding out their thumbs for a ride. Their hands tremble. 
It seems that the Comanche are as badly adapted to the white man's economy as to his diet. I once watched a heavy Comanche woman slowly pushing pennies towards a white cashier. She carefully slid each coin across the counter as though it was very difficult to part with. 
The Comanche's misery is the result of their absolute defeat during a fierce conflict with whites in the 19th Century. The Comanche War, as that conflict has come to be known, was lengthy and cruel. This terrible war that cursed both the Indians and the Americans was largely inherent in their circumstances; different races and cultures, especially aggressive ones, should not try to share the same territory. 
Always against us 
The name Comanche is a Spanish corruption of the Ute word Kohmahts , meaning enemy, stranger, or those who are always against us. Like many tribes, the Comanche called themselves simply 'the people,' or Numunuh in their own language. They are an offshoot of the Shoshone, who hail from the area of today's southern Idaho. Sometime during the 1500s, they left the mountain northwest and settled in southwest Oklahoma. There, they acquired horses from the Spanish, and began to dominate the high plains of western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, and Eastern New Mexico. This vast territory was well watered and its grasslands fed the Comanche's horses, endless herds of buffalo, and other smaller game. With the horse, the Comanche could travel rapidly on the planes, and easily kill buffalo. 
In the mountain Northwest, the Comanche had been a poor, foot-bound people; with the horse they became lords of the western plains. Their population exploded. There was no census, but estimates of their numbers vary from 10 to 30 thousand. As they grew more powerful, they started raiding their neighbors. They raided the Apache and Pueblo in Arizona and New Mexico, and the Pawnee in Eastern Kansas. They traded with the Spaniards around Santa Fe but also raided settlements in Mexico and Texas. They often took captives in Mexico and ransomed them back to traders in Santa Fe for finished goods. Neither the Spanish Empire nor the Mexican Republic had the means to stop this well-organized piracy. 
Despite constant raiding, some time around 1790 the Comanche made a lasting alliance with the Kiowa. Like the Comanche, the Kiowa had come from the mountain Northwest, moved into the southern plains, and acquired the horse. The Kiowa and Comanche spoke different languages, but lived in a very similar manner. The Kiowa were a much smaller tribe, and perhaps they fitted into a special niche: not worth raiding and too small to be a threat, but useful allies. This alliance between two extremely warlike people held year after year. The two tribes raided together so consistently that Comanche raids were often Comanche-and-Kiowa raids. 
The Comanche came to the attention of Americans when Texas became free of Mexico. Shortly after independence, in 1838, the new republic signed its first peace treaty with the Comanche '” a treaty that was probably doomed from the start. It was made with only one Comanche band, it did not define a boundary between Texas and Comanche lands, and it was never ratified by the Texas Senate. Essentially it required that the Comanche stop attacking whites '” a not unreasonable demand '” and some Comanche may have intended to abide by it. However, the Republic of Texas was a young, independent state with relatively wealthy white newcomers living in isolated settlements. They were irresistible targets for raiders, and the treaty was soon broken. 
Comanche raids were striking examples of military precision and stealth. Raiding parties could number up to 1,500, and could move undetected across the grassland. Attacks on this scale had proven brilliantly successful against traditional Comanche targets: larger villages of mostly unarmed Mexicans or other Indians. These villages had no way to fight off the Comanche or pursue them as they retreated. 
Raiders were most active during the full moon, when they could see at night. The waxing of the moon became a source of dread for Texas whites, who began to call the full moon a 'Comanche moon.' When they sacked Texas farmhouses they usually killed the men and captured the youngsters and women. Comanche women often tortured and mutilated older girls and women to make them less attractive. The women also took the lead in torturing men. They might cut the skin off their feet, tie them to a horse, and make them walk behind until they collapsed and were dragged to death. 
By 1840, just two years after the treaty, relations between whites and Comanche were murderous and getting worse by the day. In March, the Texas government sent Colonel Henry W. Karnes at the head of a group to meet a delegation of Comanche chiefs at the San Antonio Council House. Karnes was charged with recovering Texas captives and trying to improve relations. The Texans estimated that the Comanche held some 200 captives, and promised that their return would be taken as a gesture of goodwill. 
The meeting went badly. The Comanche arrived with only one of the promised captives, a young girl whose nose had been burned off. She was badly bruised from beatings, and said she had been repeatedly gang-raped. Texan soldiers, who were already angry over the raids and the broken treaty, killed the chiefs outright. Other whites opened fire on the Comanche who were outside the courthouse. 
To the Comanche, the Council House slaughter was treachery of the lowest sort. What the Texans considered savagery '” raiding, torture, and slaughter of captives '” were to them the normal practices of war. From this mutual incomprehension, and from the slaughter of the chiefs, the seeds of long-term hatred were planted. The Comanche never forgave the Texans. Throughout the decades they were pillaging Texas, Comanche could have raided Kansas '” it was no farther away than many parts of Texas '” but they saved their wrath for Texas. 
The Comanche did not wait long for revenge. In early August they launched a massive attack on the coastal towns of Victoria and Linnville. In Victoria, the local militia, often called 'Minutemen,' managed to drive off the attackers. They fired from inside buildings, and the Comanche, unused to city fighting, retreated. At Linnville, the raiders killed some 20 residents; the others survived only by boarding ships and moving just off shore, where they watched as the Comanche burned the town to the ground. Linnville never rebuilt, and the area is now a residential part of Calhoun County. 
Linnville and Victoria are hundreds of miles from the center of Comanche territory in Oklahoma, and the attacks demonstrate the extraordinary reach and mobility the raiders enjoyed. At that time, the Comanche often hunted and camped in territory as far south as Austin. The barbed wire fence had yet to be invented, so there was little to stop them. Indeed, Texans had settled only the eastern and coastal parts of the state, so the coast was well within range of inland tribes. 
The warfare that began with the council house killings and the revenge raids on Linnville and Victoria lasted until the late 1870s, and this nearly 40-year war can be divided into three stages. The first, which lasted until Texas joined the Union in 1845, pitted the Comanche against locally-organized whites supported by a Texas government that was highly sympathetic to them. The second, from 1845 until 1861, was much like the Cold War in that the federal government contained the Comanche but did not destroy their ability to make war. In the last stage of the conflict, after the Civil War, a vindictive Reconstruction government ignored bloody and repeated Comanche attacks on disarmed whites and supported the Comanche through a myriad of welfare and reform policies. Only after the post-Civil War elite was directly threatened did it take action, permanently ending the Comanche threat in 1879. 
Texans strike back 
Immediately after the great raids on Linnville and Victoria, the Texans called out the militia and assembled Ranger companies, and defeated the retreating Comanche force at the Battle of Plum Creek on August 14, 1840. The Comanche were slowed by the burden of their loot from Linnville, and also faced an enemy that was better armed and organized than their earlier Indian and Mexican antagonists. Since the 1830s, Texas Rangers had carried six-shooter revolvers as well as long rifles. The Comanche were still mostly armed with bows and arrows as well as lances, and usually retreated on their fast horses in the face of sustained gunfire. When the mounted Rangers could catch them, they would ride next to the Indians and inflict terrible losses with their six-shooters. 
Another important ingredient in subsequent successes against the Comanche was the leadership of the dynamic and aggressive Texas president, Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar. Lamar was a Georgian who had moved to Texas to escape disappointments in his career and personal life. He fought at the Battle of San Jacinto, where the Mexican Army was defeated and Texas won independence. The Texas constitution allowed for a single presidential term in office, and Lamar was elected to succeed Sam Houston. One of the new president's first challenges was the Comanche. As he put it, 'The fierce and perfidious savages are waging upon our exposed and defenseless inhabitants, an un-provoked and cruel warfare, masacreing [sic] the women and children, and threatening the whole line of our unprotected borders with speedy desolation.' 
After the victory at Plum Creek, Lamar began a policy of retaliatory raids on villages in the Comanche sanctuary in the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma. Colonel John H. Moore, accompanied by Lipan Indian scouts, led the initial foray. The Rangers moved on an area that is now Colorado City, Texas, and the Lipans discovered a village with little security. Moore sent a detachment to cover a likely escape route, and ordered the main body of his command to attack. He caught the Comanche by surprise and killed 50 in the village. The ambush detachment killed another 80 retreating Indians. The killing was somewhat indiscriminate and included women and children. Moore's tactics of attack and ambush were duplicated by the Rangers, and later, by the US cavalry. 
(Interestingly, this was the same basic plan George Custer used at Little Big Horn in 1876. The difference was that the Sioux village was massive. The Indians also had lever-action rifles and pinned down the ambush detachment while sending a larger force to overwhelm the 7th Cavalry's main attack. Custer never had a chance.) 
Lamar saw the conflict as a race war, and made no secret of his desire to rid the state of all Indian tribes. He probably would have exterminated the Comanche if he could have, but took different measures against less war-like tribes. His administration pointedly sent no aid when diseases swept through Indian territory. He began the process that moved the Cherokee, Caddo, and Tonkowa onto reservations in Oklahoma, but once they were settled peacefully, he never harried them. 
Against the Comanche, Lamar developed both defensive and offensive strategies. The Rangers' ability to defeat large groups prevented the Comanche from forming large raiding parties, and the Minutemen in the Texas settlements '” almost like local crime watches '” defended against smaller raids. The system was not perfect, but the raids became smaller and less frequent. Rangers also continued to maul Comanche villages. As T. R. Fehrenbach wrote in his definitive Comanche: A History of a People , there were many retaliatory actions 'no one bothered to report.' 
Part of the tragedy of the war is that although the Comanche had raided for generations, they had never faced an opponent like the Texans and did not understand them. Spaniards and Mexicans were disorganized prey, and could not mount a full-scale defense. Nor did they have a militia to call out. The Comanche assumed that white men were like themselves, loosely organized bands for whom an offence against one was not an insult to all. Texans saw things differently, and united against what they considered a threat to the entire state. 
Until they took on the Texans, the Comanche had always been safe from reprisal raids, so for them, the war was over when the raiding party came home. The Texans were different. Months after a raid, they would surprise an offending '” or completely innocent '” Comanche village and put it to the torch. Also, Comanche movements were limited by the seasons and buffalo hunts, whereas the Texans could campaign any time of year. By the end of Lamar's administration a generation of Comanche warriors was dead. T.R. Fehrenbach estimates that from 1838 to 1840, a quarter of the braves had been killed, most of them in the actions following the Council House fight. 
What saved the Comanche and kept the war alive were larger questions of geopolitics. The Texans were going broke. The country's finances were unsound, and the Comanche campaign was just one of several conflicts Lamar had to finance. There were constant Mexican incursions, and Lamar even sent troops into Mexico at great expense. The United States was receptive to annexation, so Texas joined the Union in 1845. The expensive Ranger companies were cut back and federal troops took over their job. At first, the Army sent only infantry to forts along the frontier, and they could not stop the Comanche from moving freely over the prairies. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis formed a cavalry regiment to send to Texas, which managed to prevent some raiding. Its efforts were helped by a cholera epidemic the 'Forty-niners' brought when they crossed the plains during the Gold Rush. It is estimated that the Comanche population dropped from 20,000 to 12,000 during this time. 
Whites began to push the internal Texas frontier forward. The east and south were settled by then, but the north and west '” where Wichita Falls and Amarillo are today '” were still raw frontier. With the Comanche more or less under control, white settlers began to fill the empty parts of the state. 
By 1860, the Comanche were on the defensive '” reduced by plague and harried by the US Cavalry. Their final defeat would have been just a matter of time, but the Civil War changed the balance of power. The federal troops left, and Confederate forces went East. The pressure lifted, and midway through the war the Comanche started raiding again. They went back to their old ways of rape, plunder, and torture, but with a new twist. They soon found they could steal Texas cattle and trade them with Comancheros '” Hispanic traders in the Rio Grande Valley '” for lever-action rifles. The Texans lost the advantage in firepower they had always enjoyed. The Comanche had always been able to get a few modern weapons, but massive industrial production and increasing trade made them much easier to get. 
The Texas Reconstruction government therefore inherited a new Comanche war that was blowing with a terrible fury, but did not take it seriously. The carpetbag elite was less interested in fighting Indians than in enriching itself at local expense and supporting the newly freed blacks. Things only got worse as the 1860s wore on, and T.R. Fehrenbach writes that by 1870, 'long-settled regions were regressing toward depopulation. Only hundreds of settlers were being killed, but meanwhile thousands were deserting the frontier. The panic was very real.' The frontier retreated '” an early form of white flight '” as farmers left their properties for safer areas. Those who stayed behind turned their haciendas into fortresses. The effect was to hold back growth; the panhandle could not be settled until the 1880s. Lyndon Baines Johnson's ancestors were among those the Comanche harried. 
Even as the Comanche were murdering white homesteaders, the government attempted a sanctuary, welfare buy-off, faith-based assimilation program that is reminiscent of modern times. During the final Comanche War from 1865 to 1879, Texas whites were disarmed by the Reconstruction government, and prevented by law from retaliatory raiding into Comanche territory. They could do little more than lobby a hostile occupation government for aid '” not always to much effect. Pro-Indian liberals in government as well as East Coast sentimentalists even prevented several murderous Indian chiefs from being hanged. Ironically, the attack those chiefs led was the very incident that caused the Army and federal government finally to act decisively. 
More humane policy 
One of the causes of federal inaction was a genuine desire to handle Indian troubles in a humane way. East of the Mississippi, Indian wars had been bloody affairs that ended with the Indians absolutely destroyed or confined. If anything, Northerners were slightly more violent than Southerners. Yankees tended to wipe out Indians and remove any survivors to small, out of-the-way reservations. In upstate New York, the Continental Army destroyed more than 40 Iroquois villages and left survivors to starve or seek aid from the British. In 1794 at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, American troops defeated an Indian force and then removed all remaining Indians from Ohio. After victories in the Midwest, whites paid the surviving Indians paltry sums for their land and sent them West with essentially no support. Abraham Lincoln's sole experience as a soldier was a brief period of garrison duty with the Illinois Militia in the otherwise bloody Blackhawk War, in which the Sac and Fox Indians were destroyed and forced out of Illinois and Wisconsin. 
In the South, the Cherokee were the source of the longest-running conflict, and held lands in Georgia long after the northeastern states had destroyed their Indians. As tensions with whites mounted, relocation became the favored solution rather than war and ad hoc expulsion, and was carried out mainly though an admittedly one-sided legal process. Cherokee removal was a relatively peaceful and fair solution to two incompatible peoples living close to each other with a long history of violence. Stand Watie, a Cherokee chief who later became a Confederate general, supported the move from Georgia to Oklahoma, and brought his band West well before the now-notorious 'Trail of Tears.' 
In that context it is understandable that after the Civil War, many pressure groups in the East, no longer threatened by Indians, pushed for more peaceful measures. Also backing the changes was the Office of Indian Affairs, which wanted more control over Indians at the expense of the Army. President Grant therefore tried to treat Indians as wards of government rather than independent nations, and to assimilate and civilize them rather than destroy them. 
In the past, Indian wars were often sparked when a dishonest Indian Agent stole government aid to the Indians for his own profit, so in 1869, Grant charged religious groups with carrying out his new policy of turning Indians into peaceful farmers. The denomination that got the Comanche assignment was the Society of Friends, or Quakers. Quakers are one of America's oldest and most influential founding groups. They live a life of piety and thrift, and disavow fancy dress and military action, but it may have been a mistake to pick a group religiously opposed to war in any form. 
President Grant's agent to the Comanche was Lawrie Tatum of Iowa, who had probably never seen an Indian before he answered his Church's call and headed West. Tatum arrived at Fort Sill in 1869 and enacted a sort of Great Society program. He started schools, gave deeds of farmland to the Comanche with instructions for farming, and established a mill for grinding grain. The Comanche also got free coffee, sugar, and blankets, and lived in safety. Soldiers secured Fort Sill and the agent's supplies, but did not interfere with Comanche activity or take to the field. Quakers would not use the military to keep the Comanche on their reservation and avoid war. 
Tatum worked hard to teach the Comanche to be civilized farmers but was defeated by circumstances. The Comanche culture's central focus was on warfare and raiding. Wealth and status could only be acquired through war, and Quaker pacifism was too foreign to graft onto their way of life. Also, welfare handouts are always unsatisfying. The Comanche were not happy with reservation rations and it was far more rewarding to plunder Texans. The Fort Sill Reservation became a sanctuary from which they could wage war. In 1871 there were even scalpings within a short distance of Army posts. Whites had sent a capable and honest agent to deal with the Comanche and bring about peace, but the Comanche were not willing to be peaceful. 
Sherman and the Comanche 
Just as it is today, it was whites who lived furthest from the menace who were convinced they knew best how to handle it. In Philadelphia or New York it was easy to talk about humane Indian policies, but on the frontier, whether in Confederate or Yankee territory, sentiments were different. In Minnesota in 1862, Sioux Indians attacked whites, killing hundreds. Many whites were fresh from northern Europe or descended from the very liberal Puritan and Quaker colonists. Yet they rallied and pushed the Sioux out of the state. 
In Colorado in 1864, Methodist minister and volunteer army officer John Chivington, a fervent abolitionist, led a force of mostly settler militia against a group of Cheyenne after a series of murderous raids. His militia massacred Indians without compunction but his force also included a few regulars from the East who were appalled by the killing and raised a stink. Chivington also made a bad mistake: He attacked a peaceful band of Indians, not the hostile Dog Soldiers, an out-of-control offshoot of the Cheyenne, who were actually doing the raiding. 
Also in 1864 an Army unit under Kit Carson fought the Comanche at the Battle of Adobe Walls, in Hutchinson County, Texas. The Indians surrounded the force but were held off with two mountain howitzers. The cannon were decisive. Carson's men were outnumbered nearly ten to one, but killed nearly 100 Indians for a loss of six whites. 
Texans therefore eventually got help from people who knew Indians first hand. Help arrived, ironically, in the form of William T. Sherman, who never had much faith in Grant's Indian policy. In 1871 he toured Texas to inspect damage from Comanche raids, and had a near encounter with Indians that had an effect on policy. A group of braves led by Set-tainte, Set-tank, and Big Tree attacked a wagon convoy of Army supplies that passed just minutes behind Sherman's lightly guarded inspection tour. The dozen men on the convoy fought back, but seven were killed, scalped, and mutilated. One man died after being tied upside down to a wagon wheel with a fire set under his head. 
Sherman was shaken by this close call, and sent out the cavalry under Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie to investigate. With information from Agent Tatum, Mackenzie cornered the three ringleaders. Set-tank died resisting arrest, but the other two were sent back to Texas for trial. 
Set-tainte and Big Tree were sentenced to death, but not executed. The trial became a circus, with the two Indians at the center of a political struggle they must have found bewildering. As T.R Fehrenbach explains, 'There was much popular sentiment in the East against hanging the aborigines; more important, the Indian Bureau and Department of the Interior strongly resented the army's interference in Indian affairs.' President Grant wired the Reconstruction governor Edmond J. Davis and asked him to commute the sentences to life in prison. Davis did so. Eventually the two were released after serving less than a year. Texans were outraged. Even Quaker Tatum, who by this time was thoroughly disillusioned with the peace policy, was indignant. 
Although President Grant had pushed for a pardon, he reconsidered the peace policy and quietly let Colonel Mackenzie take the field. Mackenzie brought along Gatling guns, which gave his men a real edge over larger forces. (Rapid-fire weapons were rarely used against mass charges of Indians '” they were too smart to try that '” but having them meant Mackenzie's men rarely had to face such charges. Things might have turned out differently for Custer if he had taken Gatling guns.) 
Mackenzie drove ruthlessly into Comanche territory. He was a hard man, who pursued Indians wherever they fled '” even into Mexico '” and his men certainly killed women and children. One of his harshest tactics was to capture any Indians he could '” women, children, elders '” and hold them hostage. This meant Comanche war parties were forced to move with their entire villages, lest their families wind up in prison camp or dead from a trigger-happy trooper. The Comanche had even more to fear from the militia. Local men who may have known people killed in raids were invariably more vengeful than professional soldiers. 
This policy of interning non-combatant Indians was part of one of the last full-scale campaigns against the Comanche, starting in August 1874, when Mackenzie pursued a force led by Chief Quanah Parker into the Llano Estacado of the Southern Plains. In late September, Mackenzie's men captured a New Mexican Comanchero trader and made him talk by stretching him over a wagon wheel. He revealed the location of a large Comanche village in a canyon. Mackenzie's men rode all night and stormed the canyon, capturing the horses, food stores, and teepees. The braves, always excellent fighters, held off the army until the women and children climbed out of the canyon, but Mackenzie burned their supplies and killed their horses. Over the next several days, he pursued and defeated the hungry, foot-bound Comanche. Many braves surrendered and returned to the reservation. 
These tactics greatly reduced the Indian menace by the end of 1875, but the Comanche faced yet another threat. The expanding railroads brought whites armed with new buffalo guns onto the prairie to hunt the buffalo for their skins. The result was a slaughter that nearly wiped out the great herds on which the Comanche had depended for generations. The hunters themselves were dangerous; one group defeated a larger force of Comanche with their excellent rifles in 1874, at the Second Battle of Adobe Walls. Constantly pursued by the Army, starving for want of game, by 1879 the Comanche were a beaten people and never again threatened Texas. From a possible high of 30,000 at the start of the 19th century, the Comanche were reduced to roughly 1,500 by 1878. A once-proud people finally submitted permanently to the reservation. 
The Comanche War is now history, its many tales preserved in movies and books. No Texan now living ever feared a Comanche moon. Today, tribal conflict takes different forms, and it is incursions from the South that are pushing back the white frontier. Clashes are not so sharp as those in the 19th century, but the outcome is no different. The destiny of Texas is being decided through immigration and demographics rather than armed conflict, but the questions remain the same: who will populate and who will rule? Earlier Americans understood what was at stake; today's Americans have been numbed into acquiescence.

Posted on October 31, 2016 'Birth of a Nation' Bombs Chris Roberts, American Renaissance, October 29, 2016 Are whites fed up with white-guilt films? 
The results are in: The new Birth of a Nation is a box-office disaster. Its ticket sales are going to fall several millions of dollars short of the cost to make and market the film'“maybe as much as ten million dollars short . This is excellent news for white America. Birth of Nation glorifies black-on-white violence at a time when black-on-white violence is on the rise , and the anti-white vitriol from groups like Black Lives Matter has never been more mainstream . 
The financial failure of Birth of a Nation is even better news when you consider the success of other recent films that cultivate white guilt and glorify black violence. In 2012, Django Unchained , another story of a black slave killing white southerners, made well over 150 percent of its production costs. In 2013, Twelve Years a Slave nearly tripled its production costs, and The Butler , the story of a sad black servant in the White House, did even better. 
Have American moviegoers lost interest in movies that tell them to feel guilty about their history? If so, the reason must surely be the rising disgust among whites at always being cast as the villains of history, and I suspect Donald Trump has had something to do with this. Win or lose, Mr. Trump has sparked a sense of pride in whites, and that affects many things, including movie-going habits. 
Think back to 2012 and 2013, when anti-white films were box office bonanzas. That 24-month period may well have been the lowest point for whites in American history. Politically, the implicitly white Tea Party movement disintegrated, and Mitt Romney lost to Barack Obama despite winning as much of the white vote as Ronald Reagan had decades earlier. Meanwhile, the number of journalists and commentators being purged for 'racism' was higher than ever: John Derbyshire, Jason Richwine, Robert Weissberg, Jack Hunter, Frank Borzellieri, Pat Buchanan, Leif Parsell, Peter Brimelow, Paul Gottfried, and Thomas Bertonneau all lost jobs. 
The white world outside of politics was not looking good either. The catastrophic waste of our wars in the Middle East had become obvious to anyone. Perhaps not by coincidence, the heroin epidemic in New England was starting and the white suicide rate was rising. The university system was becoming more and more aggressive with its theories of 'white privilege,' microaggressions, and gender fluidity'“and there seemed to be no one fighting back. The longstanding trends of black dominance in music and sports continued, and America seemed on its way to becoming this hemisphere's South Africa . 
In such a world, why not laugh along with black actor Jamie Foxx when he joked about enjoying killing all the white people in Django Unchained ? When the theory of 'white privilege' is all but doctrine, blockbusters naturally vilify whites. 
People often make their conditions worse. Frustrated young men often compound their problems by watching pornography. Frustrated jobless people often compound their problems by drinking too much. A few years ago, white America only hastened its cultural and political dispossession by going to the theater and watching The Butler . 
Things are different now. The George Zimmerman trial, the Michael Brown shooting, and Black Lives Matter have helped many whites shed their last feelings of guilt. At the same time, Donald Trump has arrived almost like a modern version of the ' redeemers ' who helped end Reconstruction in the South. All this helps whites give ' black grievance porn ' the cold shoulder. 
In any case, blacks and whites have always watched different movies. From about 1915 until the early 1950s, the ' race film ' industry produced no fewer than 500 movies that touted an 'all black cast,' or an 'all-star Negro cast.' Oscar Micheaux was a major black producer in his day, but the only whites who know about him now are dorky cinephiles. Blacks didn't want to watch Clark Gable or Joan Crawford, and when they went to a 'race film' they could sit anywhere they liked in the theater. The original (and excellent) Birth of a Nation , about the Civil War and southern resistance to Reconstruction, was boycotted by the NAACP , but a boycott by blacks was mostly symbolic. In the 1970s, blacks gorged themselves on ' blaxploitation ' films, while whites occasionally watched one out of curiosity. 
Today, playwright and film-maker Tyler Perry is overwhelmingly popular with blacks'“he made $130 million in 2011, making him the highest paid man in entertainment that year'“but many whites have never even heard of him. Who honestly thinks there are many blacks who watch contemporary white films such as Interstellar or The Lord of the Rings or Gravity ? 
Only in recent and unfortunate times have large numbers of whites watched movies made by black film makers like Spike Lee who are openly contemptuous of whites. Let us hope this has finally come to an end.

Scott McConnell, The American Conservative, October 31, 2016 
[Editor's Note: This article is worth reading in its entirety. A redacted version is below.] 
Twenty-one years ago I was assigned by Commentary to write about Jared Taylor'“today known as one of the eminences of the 'alt-right.' Taylor had written a grim book on American race relations, Paved With Good Intentions , which had been published by a mainstream house and was widely, if critically, reviewed. Though unusually skeptical about the prospect of blacks and whites living together harmoniously in the United States, it stopped well short of any systematically racist argument. The book had several fans among New Yorkers I knew prominent in journalism and city politics. 
When I referred to it in passing in a New York Post column, we quickly received a fax from Abe Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League stating that Taylor was far more extremist than I had let on. Curious to explore further, I queried Commentary '“where I then did most of my non-newspaper writing'“and they were interested. 
I interviewed Taylor, read back issues of his monthly newsletter, American Renaissance ( AR ), and drafted a piece. AR was devoted primarily to demonstrating that in American history racism was as accepted as apple pie and that this was by no means a bad thing. It contained large doses of the evolutionary and biological racial thought fairly commonplace amongst American elites in the '20s and '30s. A central contention was that the United States could not thrive as an increasingly multiracial and multicultural country and that American whites were facing a kind of cultural dispossession. 
I summarized this, quoting liberally, and concluded that the endgame vision of the AR crowd was potentially horrific, leading to national dissolution or civil war, while adding that continued mass immigration really would put the common culture of America under grave stress. If immigration rates went down, Taylor and AR would remain fringe players. If they rose, white racial anxieties would bubble to the surface, and Taylor might one day have his moment. 
The piece was never published: Neal Kozodoy, Commentary 's editor, told me I had indulged Taylor too much and asked for a shorter, tighter rewrite. By then my brief summer vacation had ended, other tasks intervened, and I eventually lost interest. 
Jared Taylor's moment has not arrived, but clearly he has edged into the national conversation. He has been pictured and quoted in an anti-Trump attack ad produced by Hillary Clinton's campaign, he has been a guest on Diane Rehm's show on NPR, and his core ideas have been broadcast'“and excoriated'“in magazines and websites great and small. He is now touted as one of the intellectual leaders of the alt-right, a diffuse movement of uncertain significance, but one deemed sufficiently important by the Clinton campaign for Hillary to devote a large portion of an August campaign speech to it. Donald Trump'“who has almost surely never read a single article by an alt-right figure'“is claimed by Clinton and other liberals to be under its influence and propagating its doctrines. 
The truth is quite different: parts of the alt-right have raised their own visibility by attaching themselves to Trump. At the same time, Trump and his unanticipated success in winning the Republican nomination are symptoms of the same political and civilizational crisis that makes alt-rightish themes'“at least in a more or less bowdlerized and soft-core form'“compelling to a growing number of people. 
â™¦â™¦â™¦ 
Taylor, 65, is old by alt-right standards, and is an atypical representative, though just how much so is difficult to discern, for much of the alt-right is anonymous. The movement fields no candidates, publishes few books or pamphlets. It is a creature of the web, strongest on Twitter. Pepe, an internet cartoon frog, is an alt-right character'“and has actually been formally denounced by the Clinton campaign. Alt-right internet trolling, sometimes ugly, blatantly racist and anti-Semitic, is also part of the movement. There is some debate whether it should be taken as an offensive and unfunny joke'“merry keyboard pranksters who enjoy pretending to be internet neo-Nazis, rather like punk rock bands of the late '70s deploying Nazi imagery for shock effect'“or is something more sinister, a genuine resurgence of hardcore racism and anti-Semitism. Likely it's more the former, but it's also likely that the alt-right banner has given the minute number of genuine neo-Nazis in the country a kind of protective shield. 
Richard Spencer may serve as a bridge between older white nationalists such as Taylor and a younger alt-right internet crowd. It's mistaken to call him or anyone else a leader'“the movement has no procedure for choosing leaders'“but he is clearly a pole of influence. He's an intellectual entrepreneur who arrived in DC roughly ten years ago from a Duke graduate program. He worked at TAC for seven or eight months, where he was kind of a square peg in a round hole. Sometime thereafter his ideology began to crystallize. He started a website called AlternativeRight.com and later revitalized a white-nationalist think tank, the National Policy Institute, and launched a journal, Radix . 
Spencer can be engaging and amusing, but his core doctrine is likely to remain, barring some sort of Mad Max-type Armageddon, well outside what most Americans would consider plausible or desirable. 
What is the doctrine? At a recent press conference in DC, Spencer explained that the core of alt-right thought is race. Race is real, race matters, race is foundational to human identity. You cannot understand who you are without race. Many people would agree'“at least privately or partially'“with the first two assertions, but the third is the critical one, and has never been true historically or sociologically. (Not that there haven't been groups of self-proclaimed pan-Asian or pan-African intellectuals who sought to make it true. Spencer fits into their tradition.) In any case, Spencer hopes somehow to spur whites into a kind of pan-white racial consciousness and galvanize them to become 'aware of who we are,' and to prepare themselves, one day somehow, to form a white ethnostate. He refers to Theodore Herzl's propagation of Zionism as a model for how such an ethnostate, seemingly a distant dream, could be eventually achieved. He fails to add that it took a Holocaust to make a Jewish State a reality. 
{snip} 
Prior to last fall, and before Hillary introduced the alt-right to a national audience, Spencer and Taylor held periodic conferences that could gather perhaps 200 people. (These were often held under shameful harassment by the leftist anti-First Amendment crowd, but that's a different issue.) Spencer says he sees the alt-right as a vehicle that will influence politicians and intellectuals, taking as its model neoconservatism. {snip} 
{snip} 
What spurred this sudden emergence? It was not white-nationalist conferences or doctrine, which had been around forever, but events. Last year the West received a nasty high-voltage shock of political reality. The first jolt was the Charlie Hebdo attack in January. France had experienced jihadist murders before, but this time, the strike came in the center of Paris, and France was alarmed to find no small amount of support for the killing among its five million Muslim residents, many of them second- and third-generation citizens. 
That spring and summer, European newspapers began to fill with reports of intensifying migrant and refugee flows, driven partially by the Syrian civil war and partially by the expansion and streamlining of people-smuggling routes from Africa. {snip} 
By 2016 the welcome had grown cold. Hundreds of migrants sexually assaulted German women in and around the central train station of Cologne on New Year's Eve, a mass assault that German authorities initially tried to cover up. {snip} 
If the sexual assaults could be seen as the cultural edge of the migrant surge, it was more difficult for even liberal 'anti-racist' European leaders to ignore or explain away the terrorism aspect. The Charlie Hebdo attack was followed by the mass slaughters at the Bataclan theater in Paris, at the Brussels Airport, then on a seaside promenade in Nice, culminating in the execution by knife of an aging French priest by two 'assimilated' Muslim migrants in his church outside of Rouen. {snip} 
{snip} Richard Spencer may be incorrect about America, but one remark from his press conference in DC last month was arresting: 
The refugee crisis in Europe is something like a world war. It is in many ways a race war. In terms of direct violence it does not resemble World War I or II. It is a demographic struggle, a struggle for identity, a struggle of who is going to define the continent, period. It is a new kind of war, a postmodern war, a war through immigration. There are no trenches, no guns. But it is a world war. 
Of course, it is not primarily a race war. Religion, or religious culture, plays a major and perhaps decisive role in the conflict, and conflict between Christendom and Islam is not new by any means. Still, there is something in the bluntness of Spencer's depiction that rings more true than 90 percent of what appears in the American media, which invariably depicts the refugee crisis in humanitarian terms and terrorism as a barely related law-enforcement issue. It is surely not a coincidence that the alt-right began making strides into American consciousness precisely at the moment Muslims were surging into Europe as refugees, while others were blowing up Parisian rock concerts or mounting mass sexual assaults on European women. 
{snip} 
Whatever one might say about the alt-right, it is not perplexed. Few other political factions in America had a vocabulary ready for'“or even made an effort to interpret seriously'“what was going on in Europe, at a time when many people were seeking one. 
{snip} 
American developments in the fall of last year, while less critical than those in Europe, also spurred the alt-right. The rise of Black Lives Matter put into question one of the outstanding domestic-policy advances of the past generation, the dramatic reduction in urban crime rates, which has made possible the revitalization of many cities. The lie which held that America's police forces were chock full of marauding racist murderers suddenly became mainstream, repeated endlessly on television and pushed in only slightly more subtle fashion by Obama's own attorney general. Meanwhile, some urban neighborhoods were looted by rioters, and others saw dramatic spikes in their murder rates. 
{snip} 
It was predictable that such developments, touching on visceral areas of personal security, national sovereignty, and freedom of expression, would stir desire for a muscular response. Donald Trump filled the bill, if not always eloquently. So too, occasionally, did segments of the more established conservative media. But there was a market for a pushback as scathing and polemically unafraid as the left's own polemicists, which might not have been the case four years earlier. This, as much as anything, accounts for the emergence of the alt-right, at least in its less ideologically extreme iterations. 
{snip} 
And though [Samuel] Huntington was a famous and deeply respected Harvard political scientist and a life-long Democrat, the concerns of Clash are those raised implicitly by Trump and explicitly by what I call the soft-core elements of the alt-right. There is, of course, much racism in American history, and there are enormous crimes for which Europe continues to strive to atone. But neither anti-racism nor respect for other cultures should be turned into a national or civilizational suicide pact. Here what Irving Kristol famously wrote about Sen. Joseph McCarthy comes to mind: 'There is one thing that the American people know about Senator McCarthy: he like them is unequivocally anti-Communist. About the spokesmen for American liberalism, they feel they know no such thing.' 
In the now global faceoff between Western civilization versus mass immigration fused with multiculturalism, Kristol's words describe with uncanny accuracy the dichotomy between Donald Trump and his supporters on one hand and those most feverishly denouncing him on the other. Among the former, for all their faults, are those who want, unequivocally, Western civilization to survive. About the latter, no such thing is certain.

Hate Rising with Jorge Ramos Fusion, October 28, 2016 
From the Ku Klux Klan to the so called alt-right movement, white supremacist groups are growing in numbers and influence. In 'Hate Rising,' Jorge Ramos shows us how their ideas, usually confined to private and secretive gatherings, are becoming mainstream thanks in part to the rhetoric on the campaign trail this election cycle.

Ben Cohen, American Thinker, October 31, 2016 
In his 'An open letter to cuckservatives', Jared Taylor wrote, 
Why do you evoke Martin Luther King when you call for a 'colorblind' America? You know he wanted quotas for blacks. You evoke King because you think he'll help you silence blacks and liberals. But it doesn't work, does it? That's because only whites'“and Asians, when it suits them'“even think in terms of 'colorblindness.' Blacks and Hispanics will squeeze every unfair advantage out of you they can. At what point will they ever abandon their aggressive racial agenda? When they're the majority just think how hard they'll squeeze your grandchildren. 
Advocates of white identity politics have two basic arguments at their disposal. The first argument could be called the racial preservationist argument, and the second could be called the collective interest argument. 
The first argument holds that national character reflects the genetics of the national population, therefore miscegenation and non-white immigration will radically alter the national character. As Jared Taylor put it, the future 'Afro-Hispanic-Caribbean-Asiatic America' will be totally unrecognizable to the founding fathers, and completely alien from the America we grew up in. 
Whatever relationship exists between national genetics and national culture, the preservationist argument has largely failed to persuade white Americans. In 1958 only 4 percent of Americans approved of white-black marriage, by 2013 87% of Americans approved of white-black marriage. For millennials, the numbers are even higher. 
But what about revealed preferences? For decades, white Americans have migrated from more homogeneous northern states to more diverse sunbelt states. In 2010, 9.4% of non-Hispanic white newlyweds married either a Hispanic person or a non-white person. 
Undoubtedly, passionate opponents of interracial marriage still exist'“not all of them white'“but their arguments haven't persuaded many people. Any argument for white nationalism or white identity politics centered on the need for racial purity is pretty much dead on arrival, because most white people don't care about racial purity. 
With appeals to racial purity out of fashion, racialists are left with appeals to collective interest. At the Alt-right press conference, Jared Taylor warned white people that their children wouldn't simply be a minority, but 'the way things are going, a hated minority.' 
This quote sticks out. Within our prison system, violent race riots have claimed the lives of many inmates. Prisoners largely segregate themselves by race, and enforce a fairly rigid system of racial separation. Based on past experience, race appears to be a particularly violent and nasty fault line. 
Even people who aren't racist will band together along racial lines, if they perceive themselves to be under threat. Most liberals find the idea of white people being persecuted ridiculous, and at the present moment it is. 
But the possibility of anti-white discrimination isn't as remote as many liberals would like to think. As J. Christian Adams documented, the Obama administration refused to prosecute minorities who engaged in voter intimidation. According to Adams they didn't simply drop charges against the NBPP members caught brandishing a club at voters in Philadelphia, they actually instructed the voting rights division not to prosecute any non-white person for voter intimidation. 
If a white president refused to prosecute racist white thugs for intimidating black voters, black people would be rightfully alarmed. There is no reason to expect whites to react differently. 
At this point, liberal readers will be saying to themselves, 'blacks are twelve percent of the population, what do we have to worry about?' 
Except, when America becomes a majority minority nation, future presidents will no longer have to depend on white votes to get elected. Future leaders could build a coalition of black and Hispanic voters, held together by shared interests. 
If this is starting to make sense to liberal readers, keep reading, it gets worse. Non-white immigrants benefit from a host of affirmative action and 'diversity' programs. In other words, immigration increases the political clout of affirmative action beneficiaries. Why exactly should white people welcome immigrants who will be favored over them? 
Especially galling is the fact that many affirmative action beneficiaries are neither poor nor disadvantaged. What are poor whites in West Virginia supposed to think about millionaire Cuban immigrants being favored over them? 
This author supports moderate immigration restriction of the type advocated by the likes of Jorge Borges or Mark Krikorian; however, he does not want white Americans to hate or fear non-white immigrants. Liberals, on the other hand, seem intent on pursuing policies almost guaranteed to revive white racism. 
This article began with a quote from Jared Taylor's letter to cuckservatives. He should add liberals to his mailing list. Liberals supplied Jared with his most persuasive argument; they deserve a thank you note and a gift card.

Professor Who Tweeted Against PC Culture Is Out at NYU Melkorka Licea, New York Post, October 30, 2016 
An NYU professor crusading against political correctness and student coddling was booted from the classroom last week after his colleagues complained about his 'incivility,' The Post has learned. 
Liberal studies prof Michael Rectenwald, 57, said he was forced Wednesday to go on paid leave for the rest of the semester. 
{snip} 
Rectenwald launched an undercover Twitter account called Deplorable NYU Prof on Sept. 12 to argue against campus trends like 'safe spaces,' 'trigger warnings' policing Halloween costumes and other aspects of academia's growing PC culture. 
He chose to be anonymous, he explained in one of his first tweets, because he was afraid 'the PC Gestapo would ruin me' if he put his name Â­behind his conservative ideas on the famously liberal campus. 
{snip} 
But the Twitter feed soon sparked a 'witch hunt' by the growing army of 'social justice warriors,' he said. 
In an interview published Monday in the Washington Square News, NYU's Independent Student Newspaper, the eight-year instructor admitted he was the Deplorable NYU Prof. 
'My contention is that trigger warning, safe spaces and bias hot-line reporting is not politically correct. It is insane,' he told the student paper. 'The crazier and crazier that this left gets .'‰.'‰. the more the alt-right is going to be laughing their asses off [and] getting more pissed.', he was quoted as saying. 
{snip} 
But Rectenwald says he began getting 'dirty looks' in his department and on Wednesday figured out why: A 12-person committee calling itself the Liberal Studies Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Working Group, including two deans, published a letter to the editor in the same paper. 
'As long as he airs his views with so little appeal to evidence and civility, we must find him guilty of illogic and incivility in a community that predicates its work in great part on rational thought and the civil exchange of ideas,' they wrote of the untenured assistant professor. 
'We seek to create a dynamic community that values full participation. Such efforts are not the 'destruction of academic integrity' Professor Rectenwald suggests, but rather what make possible our program's approach to global studies,' they argued. Rectenwald likened the attack to 'a Salem witch trial. They took my views personally. I never even mentioned them and I never even said NYU liberal studies program. I was talking about academia at large,' said the professor, a popular instructor who was graded 4.4 out of 5 on ratemyprofessors.com . 
The same day the letter was published, Rectenwald was summoned to a meeting with his department dean and an HR representative, he says. 
'They claimed they were worried about me and a couple people had expressed concern about my mental health. They suggested my voicing these opinions was a cry for help,' Rectenwald told The Post. 'Then they said I should leave and get help.' 
{snip} 
Students told him that professors openly discussed with students how he may be fired. 
The leave has 'absolutely zero to do with his Twitter account or his opinions on issues of the day,' said NYU spokesman Matt Nagel. 
But Rectenwald is disheartened. 
'I'm afraid my academic career is over,' he said Rectenwald. 'Academic freedom: It's great, as long as you don't use it.'

{snip} As a veteran of trolling leftists for an entire decade (the SPLC whines I have 'been playing * * * [this] same kind of game for many years' and that I am 'one of the Alt-Right's most vicious attack dogs' ; the student newspaper of Michigan State University noted in 2006 that my group planned to 'have more events such as chalking * * * [and] poster-hanging[s]' ; Michigan State University's President Lou Anna Simon releases a statement in 2007 which pertinently states 'In recent weeks, there have been incidents on campus that once again compel us to look at the issues of free speech and how we as a campus community engage with one another in ways that respect the views of multiple groups and individuals. * * * There are individuals who speak at campus events whose rhetoric and ideas I find reprehensible[.]' ), I have personal experience with postering campaigns, and as an attorney, I know exactly where the line is that cannot be crossed. Here are suggestions to Alt-Right activists who are interested in hanging up posters: Do not get caught. Targets for postering should be explored in advance of distribution so as to make sure that there are no security cameras in the vicinity. (Do not wear similar clothing when the venue is explored as is worn at the time of the postering in case cameras are present.) Use teams of at least three'“one person hangs up posters and two people watch for interlopers. The best time to poster is between 10:00 p.m. and midnight'”any earlier, and one is likely to run into Normies, and any later, one will attract unwanted attention. Tape is best to use for postering and the tape should be used along all four edges of the posters so as to prevent them from being ripped down; tacks can easily be removed to take down posters and glue should not be used because glue is too messy and time-consuming. Hanging up posters in university buildings that contain only classrooms at night is better than dormitories because one is less likely to run into people who may tear down the posters. Only hang up posters at public'“not private'“universities and on public bulletin boards. Public universities must comply with the U.S. Constitution'“and the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit government actors from discriminating against viewpoint or the content of speech. Only hang up posters on public bulletin boards since an argument can be made if one is caught that this is either a public forum or limited public forum . If one hangs up a poster on a wall of a building or on a non-public bulletin board, diversity-mongers who are offended by the posters may allege that criminal vandalism or criminal trespass occurred. Do not voluntarily disclose information if caught. If someone who is not a police officer demands one's identification, one is under no obligation to provide it. If a police officer demands one's identification, only the identifiers on a driver's license and identifiers that are not incriminating should be provided (name, address, phone number, birth date, etc). One should not say anything else to the police other than 'I respectfully invoke my right to remain silent, I respectfully invoke my right to have an attorney present, and am I being detained?' Such language invokes rights that are outside the scope of this brief article, but anyone who has ever watched an episode of Cops would know that statements made by a criminal suspect can be used against that person in court and lying to the police during an investigation is a crime in and of itself. If one's state is a one-party consent state for recording purposes , one should secretly record any and all interactions with law enforcement. One should immediately consult with a licensed attorney in their state who is experienced with criminal defense or civil litigation if police become involved due to one hanging up posters. Do not publish posters that target individual people. This could result in harassment-related criminal charges, a civil lawsuit, or a personal protection order being pursued by the victim. Posters that are merely generically inflammatory but which do not direct the viewers to 'imminent lawless action' are constitutionally permissible. Brandenburg v. Ohio , 395 U.S. 444 (1969) .

Agents Accuse Feds of Covering Up Record Border Detainee Numbers for 2016 Election Brandon Darby, Breitbart, October 30, 2016 
A record number of illegal aliens have crossed the U.S.- Mexico border and are in U.S. Border Patrol custody in Texas' Rio Grande Valley Sector (RGV), according to the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC). Border Patrol Agent and NBPC President Brandon Judd spoke exclusively with Breitbart Texas and condemned the leadership of the Border Patrol's parent agency, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), for allegedly 'keeping this information secret' ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
'We are at breaking point. We have the highest number of illegal aliens in custody in history in Border Patrol's RGV Sector and this information has been kept from the American public,' said Agent Judd. 'The talk of amnesty has once again created pull factors and encouraged people from all over the world to cross Mexico and then cross our porous southern border to illegally enter the U.S. We are simply overwhelmed.' {snip} 
Agent Judd told Breitbart Texas that Americans should vote their conscience, but they should do so with all of the information available. 'This is an issue of the federal government restricting crucial information from the public ahead of a presidential election and it is unacceptable. Americans deserve to know the truth. Our Border Patrol agents deserve for Americans to know what they are really facing. Too many Border Patrol agents have given their lives and left loved ones to grieve for CBP leadership to play these types of political games ahead of such an impactful election.' 
{snip} 
Historically, CBP, Border Patrol's parent agency, has had to correct false assertions and denials. Perhaps the most glaring example occurred in June 2014 when an official CBP Twitter account directly accused this reporter of publishing a false report, only to later admit the report was accurate and true . 
{snip} 
UPDATE: Breitbart Texas received this response from CBP: 
First, the number in custody in RGV is less than half what is was in June 2014. 
Also, I would refer you to Secretary Johnson's statement about southwest border security issued October 17. In it, the Secretary addresses the specific issue of unaccompanied children and family units. The statement includes statistics for the full year of fiscal year 2016.

Abstract 
Male'“female ability differences in the right tail (at or above the 95th percentile) have been widely discussed for their potential role in achievement and occupational differences in adults. The present study provides updated male-female ability ratios from 320,000 7th grade students in the United States in the right tail (top 5%) through the extreme right tail (top 0.01%) from 2011 to 2015 using measures of math, verbal, and science reasoning. Additionally, the present study establishes male-female ability ratios in a sample of over 7000 7th grade students in the right tail from 2011 to 2015 in India. Results indicate that ratios in the extreme right tail of math ability in the U.S. have shrunk in the last 20 years (still favoring males) and remained relatively stable in the verbal domain (still favoring females). Similar patterns of male-female ratios in the extreme right tail were found in the Indian sample.

Who Paid Hillary Clinton $21.7 Million to Give Speeches? American Renaissance, October 31, 2016 
There are legal limits on the amount of money a corporation can contribute to a political campaign, and the contributions are not tax-deductible.

Siobhan McFadyen, Express, October 31, 2016 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing catastrophe over her failed migrant policy, according to a new report. 
During the first six months of 2016, migrants committed 142,500 crimes, according to the Federal Criminal Police Office. 
And the country has been hit by a spate of horrendous violent crime including rapes, sexual and physical assaults, stabbings, home invasions, robberies, burglaries and drug trafficking. 
Adding to the country's woes is the fact that thousands of people have gone missing after travelling to the country on invitation from the country's leader. 
Germany took in more than 1.1million migrants in the past year and parts of the country are crippled with a lack of infrastructure. 
Now the true reality is hitting home ahead of next year's elections as the far right surges in the polls threatening to topple the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Mrs Merkel. 
According to a report by the international policy council the Gatestone Institute, local police in many parts of the country admit that they are stretched to the limit. 
The report states: 'The rape of a ten-year-old girl in Leipzig, the largest city in Saxony, has drawn renewed attention to the spiralling levels of violent crime perpetrated by migrants in cities and towns across Germany. 
'During the first six months of 2016, migrants committed 142,500 crimes, according to the Federal Criminal Police Office. This is equivalent to 780 crimes committed by migrants every day, an increase of nearly 40 per cent over 2015. The data includes only those crimes in which a suspect has been caught. 
'Thousands of migrants who entered the country as 'asylum seekers' or 'refugees' have gone missing. They are, presumably, economic migrants who entered Germany on false pretences. 
'Many are thought to be engaging in robbery and criminal violence.' 
According to Freddi Lohse of the German Police Union in Hamburg, many migrant offenders view the leniency of the German justice system as a green light to continue delinquent behaviour, says the report. 
He said: 'They are used to tougher consequences in their home countries. 
'They have no respect for us.' 
Meanwhile a female police officer has admitted that officers are under attack and that the courts are a 'joke.' 
In a new book, Tania Kambouri, a German police officer, said: 'For weeks, months and years I have noticed that Muslims, mostly young men, do not have even a minimum level of respect for the police. 
'When we are out patrolling the streets, we are verbally abused by young Muslims. 
'There is the body language, and insults like 's*** cop' when passing by. 
'If we make a traffic stop, the aggression increases ever further, this is overwhelmingly the case with migrants. 
'It cannot be that offenders continue to fill the police files, hurt us physically, insult us, whatever, and there are no consequences. 
'Many cases are closed or offenders are released on probation or whatever. 
'Yes, what is happening in the courts today is a joke.' 
Migrants committed 208,344 crimes in 2015, according to a confidential police report leaked to Bild. 
This figure represents an 80 per cent increase since 2014 and is equivalent to 570 crimes committed by migrants every day, or 23 crimes each hour, in 2015 alone. 
The report added: 'The growing sense of lawlessness is substantiated by an October 24 YouGov poll which found that 68 per cent of Germans believe that security in the country has deteriorated during the past several years. 
'Nearly 70 per cent of respondents said they fear for their lives and property in German train stations and subways, while 63 per cent feel unsafe at large public events.'

Places Most Unsettled by Rapid Demographic Change Are Drawn to Donald Trump Janet Adamy and Paul Overberg, Wall Street Journal, November 1, 2016 
Small towns in the Midwest have diversified more quickly than almost any part of the U.S. since the start of an immigration wave at the beginning of this century. The resulting cultural changes appear to be moving the political needle. 
A Wall Street Journal analysis of census data shows that counties in a distinct cluster of Midwestern states'“Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota'“saw among the fastest influxes of nonwhite residents of anywhere in the U.S. between 2000 and 2015. Hundreds of cities long dominated by white residents got a burst of Latino newcomers who migrated from Central America or uprooted from California and Texas. 
That shift helps explain the emergence of Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump as a political force, and signals that tensions over immigration will likely outlive his candidacy. Among GOP voters in this year's presidential primaries, counties that diversified rapidly were more likely to vote for the New York businessman, the Journal's analysis shows. 
{snip} 
The Journal identified the epicenter of this shift using the diversity index, a tool often used by social scientists and economists. It measures the chance that any two people in a county will have a different race or ethnicity. In 244 counties, that diversity index at least doubled between 2000 and 2015, and more than half those counties were in the cluster of five Midwestern states. The analysis excludes tiny counties that produce numeric aberrations. 
{snip} 
Mr. Trump won about 71% of sizable counties nationwide during the Republican presidential primaries. He took 73% of those where diversity at least doubled since 2000, and 80% of those where the diversity index rose at least 150%, the Journal's analysis found.

Early Voting Data Shows African American Turnout Dropping Neil Munro, Breitbart, October 31, 2016 
A blizzard of early reports show that early voting by pro-Democratic African-Americans has dropped significantly compared to 2012, giving a boost to Donald Trump's prospects in critical swing-states, such as North Carolina and Ohio. 
In North Carolina, early voting by African-Americans is sharply down, so 'you will see a very heavy push in this state for the African-American vote by Hilary Clinton to try to make up some of deficit,' said Michael Bitzer, a professor of politics and history at Catawba College, in Salisbury, N.C. 
{snip} 
Nationally, 'African-American enthusiasm has dipped compared with that in 2012,' according to the New York Times . That's 'a surprising and disquieting development for Democrats who believed Trump's racial appeals and flirtations with the birther movement would generate more urgency,' the Times reported . For example, in the two Virginia districts with the largest percentage of African American adults, early voting has dropped by more than 50 percent, the Times said. 
In Ohio, the decline of early voting in heavily Democratic African-American districts is causing worry for Democrats'“and a shift of resources into the low-turnout areas. {snip} 
In Florida, 'the bad news for Clinton/good news for Trump is that African-Americans and millenials are voting considerably lighter'“so far'“than four years ago,' the Tampa Bay Times reported Oct. 31. 
Daniel Smith, a political science professor in Florida noted the rising level of early voting among whites and Hispanics, compared to to African-Americans. 
In North Carolina, 'white voters are currently 72 percent of all absentee ballots cast, with black voters being 22 percent and all other races 6 percent. This represents a steady continuation of the trends that we have seen, with white voters over-performing their 2012 numbers and black voters under-performing their 2012 numbers,' Blitzer said at his blog, Old North State Politics .

David Weigel, Washington Post, October 31, 2016 
{snip} 
Following the latest FBI inquiry, which has dominated news coverage for days and has been described as a potential lifeline for Republican nominee Donald Trump, Clinton's campaign is counting on its organization more than ever to revive the coalition that twice elected Barack Obama. 
In places such as Michigan, that means turning out minorities in big numbers to overcome Trump's advantage among white voters. The trend in early-voting returns has been both encouraging and worrying for the Clinton campaign: Enthusiasm among Latinos appears to be up, in some cases considerably, but African Americans are turning out in smaller numbers than they did with Obama on the ticket. 
That's the picture in Florida. Early returns show a boost in turnout in heavily Latino counties and a decline in largely African American ones. In a state such as Nevada, where Democrats are relying heavily on Latinos, early returns show they are voting in similar numbers as in 2012, boosting Democratic chances. But in battleground states such as Ohio where Democrats are counting on African Americans to put them over the top, they could be in trouble if blacks stay home. 
Polling shows a similar story. Clinton maintains a large lead among nonwhite voters in the Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll, but by a smaller margin than Obama did. In polling since Oct. 20, Clinton has led Trump by more than 3 to 1 among all nonwhites (69 percent to 19 percent), compared with President Obama's margin of 80 percent to 19 percent in 2012. 
Moreover, nonwhite voters are more united by their strong dislike of Trump than positive views of Clinton'“only 39 percent have a strongly favorable view of Clinton, while 68 percent have strongly unfavorable views toward Trump. 
{snip} 
In closer states, Trump's campaign is working to soften enthusiasm for Clinton among young black voters. One TV ad plays a clip of Clinton, then supportive of a new crime bill, referring to a group of young black offenders as 'super-predators.' That two-decade-old quote'“even after an apology'“has dogged Clinton with some Black Lives Matters activists. Trump has also sought to dampen enthusiasm by casting life in black communities as something akin to apocalyptic. 
{snip} In North Carolina, where Democrats and civil rights groups won a high-profile lawsuit against Republican-backed voting restrictions, the early look is mixed. Total black turnout has fallen 17 percent from its 2012 level, but Democrats point to a shrunken number of early-voting locations to claim that they are on track. At the polls, the voters who are showing up said they feel an obligation, if not passion. 
'It's not like four years ago when we knew we were going for Barack Obama, no ifs, ands and buts,' Sunia Wilson, 38, said after casting a ballot at the Chavis Community Center in Raleigh. 'This year it's like, 'Hmmm. I don't know.' But I've got to vote.'

Study Finds Racial Discrimination by Uber and Lyft Drivers Eric Newcomer, Bloomberg, October 31, 2016 
Drivers for Uber Technologies Inc. in Boston canceled rides for men with black-sounding names more than twice as often as for other men. Black people in Seattle using Uber and Lyft Inc. faced notably longer wait times to get paired with drivers than white customers. The findings come from a study published on Monday by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University and the University of Washington. 
{snip} 
A new generation of technology companies have begun to grapple with how they can minimize racial discrimination. Airbnb Inc. recently released an extensive report studying racial bias on the site and proposed some changes to its policies. The home-rental company committed to offering more training for its hosts and hiring a more diverse workforce. It sent e-mails to customers over the weekend saying they must agree not to discriminate in order to use the site starting next month. However, Airbnb has resisted advocates' calls to remove photos of guests and hosts from its platform. 
In the case of ride-hailing apps, researchers similarly believe that names and photos are an issue. Such information gives drivers the means to discriminate against prospective riders. Uber doesn't show customer photos to drivers. Lyft does, but passengers aren't required to provide a headshot. Both San Francisco-based companies give riders' names to their drivers. 
{snip} 
The study, conducted in Seattle and Boston, included almost 1,500 rides. Four black and four white research assistants'“split evenly among men and women'“ordered cars over six weeks in Seattle. All used their photos on the ride-sharing apps. A second test was held in Boston with riders 'whose appearance allowed them to plausibly travel as a passenger of either race,' although they used either 'African American sounding' or 'white sounding' names, the researchers said. The study found that Uber drivers disproportionately canceled on riders with black-sounding names, even though the company penalizes drivers who cancel frequently. 
{snip} 
The research also observed discrimination in the taxi industry'“a well-known, decades-old issue. The paper doesn't compare the rate of discrimination between traditional drivers for taxis or ride-hailing apps. Uber has suggested that it doesn't offer tips in its app, as many drivers have asked for, because they can introduce racial biases. 
Lyft and Uber face different issues. While researchers found that drivers took noticeably longer to accept ride requests from black men on both services in Seattle, total wait times were the same for both races on Lyft. On Uber, total wait times were longer for black men. Drivers using Lyft didn't cancel on black riders disproportionately, but the researchers said that because Lyft shows riders' names and faces upfront, its drivers could simply screen out black passengers. Uber doesn't show names until after the driver accepts the fare. 'In Lyft, you can discriminate without ever having to accept and hit cancel,' Knittel said.

Chicago Soars Past 600 Homicides After Bloody October CBS Chicago, November 1, 2016 
With 78 homicides, October was the second deadliest month of 2016, and Chicago surpassed 600 homicides for the first time in more than a decade. 
The last time Chicago had at least 600 homicides in a single year was 2003. 
Homicides and non-fatal shootings have skyrocketed in 2016, with 605 homicides and more than 3,600 shooting victims through the end of October. 
In October, there were 78 homicides and 427 shooting victims. Only August had more homicides, when 90 people were slain in Chicago. It was the bloodiest month in the city in 20 years. 
The city is on pace for 726 homicides in 2016, a number not seen since the late 1990s.

SWAT Standoff Suspect Linked to Zionsville Murder, IMPD HQ Shootings Rich van Wyk and David Macanally, WTHR (Indianapolis), October 31, 2016 
The suspect in a SWAT standoff on Indianapolis' far northeast side Monday afternoon has been connected to recent shootings at IMPD headquarters and the September murder of an 82-year-old Zionsville man. 
Damoine Wilcoxson surrendered peacefully around 4:15 p.m. after a hours-long standoff with IMPD at an apartment complex near Shadeland Ave. & Mill View Dr. Damoine Wilcoxson 
Wilcoxson was holding his 6-month-old son inside the apartment during the standoff. The boy's grandmother stood across the street during the ordeal, waiting alongside everyone else and hoping he would be okay. 
{snip} 
Wilcoxson was armed during the standoff and police say he fired at officers through the door. No one was injured and officers did not return fire due to concerns for the child. 
{snip} 
Prosecutors say Wilcoxson faces a murder charge for the shooting death of John Clements less than half a mile from Zionsville High School on Sept. 28 . It was the first murder Zionsville has seen in 20 years. 
{snip} 
According to court documents, investigators believe Wilcoxson is also related to the IMPD headquarters shootings that occurred on October 4 and October 13. Detectives found handwritten notes demanding $100,000 and threats including 'white must die' near the shell casings that were connected with the Oct. 4 shooting at IMPD Northwest District headquarters. Similar notes were found near the shell casings discovered after the Oct. 13 shooting at IMPD North District headquarters. 
'At least in one of those shootings, we believe that he intentionally targeted two police officers inside,' IMPD Chief Troy Riggs said, 'and we're going to be requesting attempted murder charges.' 
He allegedly fired almost 50 rounds at those police stations earlier this month. No officers were hurt, but he allegedly left a note at the crime scene threatening more shootings if he didn't get $100,000. 
Detectives discovered that the shell casings from both IMPD shootings were a match. A DNA sample from one of the notes and a shell casing matched Wilcoxson's profile. 
Court papers say forensic evidence links his gun to all those cases, but his stepfather says, 'No, no, no, he's not.' 
The stepfather doesn't believe Damoine is connected to those crimes. 
His aunt, Detra Boyd, said, 'He had a moment. That's all.' 
{snip} 
FBI undercover agents friended him on Facebook during the probe into the police station attacks and the Zionsville murder. According to court documents, they found anti-white remarks and posts like 'Kill mankind. No one should survive. We all live in lies,' plus 'eye-4-eye, tooth for tooth, head for head, life for life.' 
{snip} 
Wilcoxson has a long criminal history that includes run-ins with police since he was 14 years old.

Most College Students Think America Invented Slavery, Professor Finds Kate Hardiman, College Fix, October 31, 2016 
For 11 years, Professor Duke Pesta gave quizzes to his students at the beginning of the school year to test their knowledge on basic facts about American history and Western culture. 
The most surprising result from his 11-year experiment? Students' overwhelming belief that slavery began in the United States and was almost exclusively an American phenomenon, he said. 
'Most of my students could not tell me anything meaningful about slavery outside of America,' Pesta told The College Fix . 'They are convinced that slavery was an American problem that more or less ended with the Civil War, and they are very fuzzy about the history of slavery prior to the Colonial era. Their entire education about slavery was confined to America.' 
Pesta , currently an associate professor of English at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, has taught the gamut of Western literature'“from the Classics to the modern'“at seven different universities, ranging from large research institutions to small liberal arts colleges to branch campuses. He said he has given the quizzes to students at Purdue University, University of Tennessee Martin, Ursinus College, Oklahoma State University, and University of Wisconsin Oshkosh. 
{snip} 
Before even distributing the syllabus for his courses, Pesta administered his short quizzes with basic questions about American history, economics and Western culture. For instance, the questions asked students to circle which of three historical figures was a president of the United States, or to name three slave-holding countries over the last 2,000 years, or define 'capitalism' and 'socialism' in one sentence each. 
Often, more students connected Thomas Jefferson to slavery than could identify him as president, according to Pesta. On one quiz, 29 out of 32 students responding knew that Jefferson owned slaves, but only three out of the 32 correctly identified him as president. Interestingly, more students'“six of 32'“actually believed Ben Franklin had been president. 
{snip} 
What's more, he began to observe a shift in his students' quiz responses in the early 2000s. Before that time, Pesta described his students as 'often historically ignorant, but not politicized.' Since the early 2000s, Pesta has found that 'many students come to college preprogrammed in certain ways.' 
'They cannot tell you many historical facts or relate anything meaningful about historical biographies, but they are, however, stridently vocal about the corrupt nature of the Republic, about the wickedness of the founding fathers, and about the evils of free markets,' Pesta said. 'Most alarmingly, they know nothing about the fraught history of Marxist ideology and communist governments over the last century, but often reductively define socialism as 'fairness.'' 
Pesta also noted that, early on, his students' 'blissful ignorance was accompanied by a basic humility about what they did not know.' But over time he said he increasingly saw 'a sense of moral superiority in not knowing anything about our 'racist and sexist' history and our 'biased' institutions.' 
'As we now see on campus,' Pesta said, 'social justice warriors are arguing that even reading the great books of Western culture is at best a micro-aggression, and at worst an insidious form of cultural imperialism and indoctrination.'

America Is Better Without Borders Steven Hahn, TIME, November 1, 2016 
'A nation without borders,' Donald Trump has warned us , 'is not a nation at all.' Trump was explaining the logic of the multi-billion dollar wall he promises to build along the U.S.-Mexican border, but he was hardly the first to make the case. Years ago, Ronald Reagan said much the same about the threat of illegal immigration, and others urging border vigilance have wrapped themselves in the high-flown rhetoric. Tee-shirts and coffee mugs have turned the idea into a saleable slogan. 
{snip} 
{snip} For much of its early history, the United States had hazy borders in good part because through war, conquest and diplomacy the country was constantly expanding and the shifting boundaries were not clearly marked. There was no agreement about how far west the Louisiana Territory reached or how far south the state of Texas stretched or how far north the Oregon Territory extended. Highly charged political words and brutal conflict followed (like the U.S.-Mexican War), while the imperial eyes of many leaders fell on Cuba, Central America and Hawaii. 
What's more, the borders that were agreed upon were remarkably porous. Until well into the nineteenth century, immigrants could come and go at will and even participate in electoral politics if they simply declared an intention to become citizens; indeed, for decades it was not at all clear what a citizen of the United States was. The only international migration policed was the African slave trade, which Congress outlawed in 1808 after nearly half a million captives had been forcibly deposited on North American shores. 
{snip} 
It is easy, when politics and ethnocentrism serve, to proclaim the principle of the nation with borders as the nation itself, while the borders are, in fact, regularly traversed by policy makers, investors and moneyed interests pursuing the main chance and wielding the big stick. Trump himself regularly touts, though refuses to reveal, his international dealings, many of which confound his goal of keeping jobs within American borders if they don't outright violate American laws. 
Truth is that the nation's prosperity has long rested on the labor and resourcefulness of immigrants'“voluntary and involuntary, free and slave'“and that those who most loudly denounce a 'nation without borders' are likely descendants of immigrants who were themselves harassed for their origins, faith and lifeways at some point in the past. We would do well to recognize that in a global economy such as ours, where the movement of people and goods are the lifeblood of our sustenance, a nation's security is best maintained not by walling itself off but by lifting the prospects'“and thereby creating political allies'“of working people around the world.

Sweden on the Brink? Police Force Pushed to Breaking Point by Violence amid Migrant Influx Lizzie Stromme, Express, November 1, 2016 
Sweden is on the brink of becoming a lawless state as the police force is losing the battle against unprecedented levels of crime and violence amid a growing migrant crisis. 
The Scandinavian country is facing an existential crisis with on average three police officers handing in their resignations a day. 
If the alarming trend continues, and police officers continue to resign more than 1,000 officers will have quit the service by New Years. 
Since the migrant crisis began last summer, Sweden has been hit by a series of brutal crimes and violent incidents . 
In 2015 alone Sweden, with a population of 9.5 million, received over 160,000 asylum applications and the country is expected to take as many as 190,000 refugees, or two per cent of the population, by the end of 2016. 
Since the Second World War Sweden has prided itself on helping migrants who cross their borders despite some moves to the political right in recent years. 
But police have now admitted the force has reached breaching point as more than 50 areas in the country have now been placed on a 'no-go zone' list . 
In February a report from Sweden's National Criminal Investigation Service announced there were 52 areas where officers would not cope with the levels of crime being committed . 
Sex assaults , drug dealing and children carrying weapons were just some of the incidents mentioned in the report. 
In September, Swedish officials were forced to add another three areas to the list. 
Now the Police Association have said they need at least 200 new officers to regain control in the south-east of the country. 
Thomas Stjernfeldt, from the region's police association, told SVT : 'We are missing extremely many officers in the operational sector, right now we need 200 more officers to be added to the force to establish a reasonable working environment in the southeast of GÃ¶taland.' 
GÃ¶taland is one of the regions in the country that has been hit hard by the car fire attacks, which have been occurring throughout Sweden. 
On Monday, Express.co.uk reported a number of the arsonist attacks in the city of VÃ¤xjÃ¶, in GÃ¶taland, had been committed by frustrated migrants . 
Currently there are more than 6,000 suspected crimes that are unsolved in the area and 400 of these cases are suspected to be rapes, murder or attempted murder. 
Mr Stjernfeldt said the figures are alarming and police officers are constantly forced to work overtime in an attempt to solve the reported crimes. 
The Police Association admitted it fears the public will lose faith in the force and their ability to protect citizens if the situation is not resolved. 
The union's call for more resources echoes National Police Commissioner Dan Eliasson's February warning, where he said he needed a further 4,100 officers and specialist staff to reestablish law and order in Sweden.

Turnbull to Propose Law That Bans Boat Asylum Seekers from Australia Permanently News, October 31, 2016 
Federal Labor will look closely at the government's new tough stance on refugees but says it's ridiculous that some banned from Australia won't ever be allowed to visit for business, accusing Malcolm Turnbull of pandering to One Nation. 
The opposition has not entirely ruled out the government's proposed lifetime ban on asylum seekers who arrive by boat, instead saying it will look at the legislation before coming up with a position. 
Under the plan, all adults sent to offshore immigration centres on Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island would be prevented from ever entering Australia, even as tourists or on business, regardless of whether they're found to be refugees or not. 
The coalition is ramping up its attack on Opposition Leader Bill Shorten for not publicly stating a position on the ban within 24 hours of its announcement. 
'This bloke is weak,' former immigration minister Scott Morrison told Sydney radio station 2GB. 
Mr Shorten says Labor will look closely at the legislation 'when the government can be bothered releasing it'. 
'It seems ridiculous to me that a genuine refugee who settles in the US or Canada and becomes a US or Canadian citizen is banned from visiting Australia as a tourist, businessman or businesswoman 40 years down the track,' he said. 
He also took aim at the prime minister, saying the Mr Turnbull of old would never have proposed this to keep the right-wing extremists in his party happy. 
'He's earning the praise of Pauline Hanson'“I hope he's proud of that.' 
Meanwhile, One Nation is both applauding and claiming a win over the government's tough stance. 
Its Queensland senator Malcolm Roberts said the government was 'dancing to our tune', while leader Pauline Hanson put it more bluntly. 
'Refugees are not welcome here,' she told the Seven Network. 
Concerns have also been raised the ban may contravene article 31 of the international refugee convention, which states signatory nations shall not penalise refugees for illegal entry when they have come directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened. 
Amnesty International says the outrageous and unnecessary law discriminates against people seeking safety based on their mode of arrival, a clear breach of Australia's obligations. 
''This is yet another layer of cruelty in Australia's already deliberately abusive policy,' refugee campaigner Ming Yu Hah said. 
But Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull insists the plan does not contravene the convention. 
'We have taken legal advice and we are satisfied it is within power and consistent with our international obligations,' he told reporters in outback South Australia on Monday. 
Greens leader Richard Di Natale told ABC radio he was hopeful that 'if Labor shows a little bit of courage on this issue', it could be struck down. 
Mr Turnbull said the government has spoken to just one of the 11 Senate crossbenchers about the proposal, which it will put to parliament next week. 
Independent senators Derryn Hinch and Nick Xenophon separately said they supported the government in general but wanted to see details. 
Meanwhile, the debate comes as the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Francois Crepeau, is due to arrive on Tuesday to look at the government's migration policies and laws. 
Earlier 
The Federal Government wants to pass laws to make sure no asylum seekers who tried to come to Australia by boat, even those found to be refugees, can ever enter the country. 
The Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull today told media 'the door to Australia is closed to those who seek to come here by boat with a people smuggler'. 
'That absolutely unflinching, unequivocal message has to be loud and clear,' he told reporters in Sydney this morning. 
The government will ask parliament to ban everyone who was sent to Nauru or Papua New Guinea's Manus Island for offshore immigration processing after July 19, 2013'“the date Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd declared: 'As of today, asylum seekers who come here by boat without a visa will never be settled in Australia.' 
The ban would apply whether or not they were found to be refugees and extends to all types of visas, including tourist and business categories. Asylum seekers aged under 18 at the time they were sent to Nauru or Manus Island would be exempt. 
The minister would also have power to lift the bar if they believe it's in the public interest for someone to be allowed in to Australia. 
Immigration Minister Peter Dutton described the plan as one of the government's strongest moves, building on the success of its border protection policies over the past three years. 
It sent a clear message that Australia was not an option. 
'There are still people, advocates in Australia and elsewhere, who are messaging to people on Nauru and Manus, that at some stage you'll come to Australia,' Mr Dutton said. 
'Those people are living in false hope and it cannot continue.' The legislation would reflect the coalition's long-standing policy and what it understood to be Labor's position, Mr Turnbull said. 
He expects the opposition will give 'unequivocal support' to the move. 
Foreign Minister Julie Bishop earlier this morning said the government would enshrine in law what had been a longstanding policy. 
'This is a tough message we are sending to the people smuggling syndicates and those who pay people smugglers to try and enter Australia,' she told ABC TV. 
'We are sending a strong message to those currently in Manus and Nauru, if they are found to be owed protection, they will not be resettled in Australia. If they're not found to be owed protection, they should return home.' 
This would even apply to accepted refugees later attempting to visit via tourist visa, she said. 
'I will never forget 1200 people that we know of drowned at sea coming to Australia under these people smuggling networks,' she said. 'We cannot have situations where people are drowning at sea and that is why we are working through the case load, the cohort of people who are on Manus and Nauru, to find third country resettlements for them and if they want to stay in PNG and in Nauru, they can be resettled there.' 
Mr Turnbull expects Labor and its leader Bill Shorten will support the laws, saying they are 'entirely consistent with his party's stated public position'. 
Mr Dutton added Australia has 'discussions ongoing with a number of countries' on the issue of resettling the asylum seekers already at Naru and Manus. 
Deputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek said it was too soon to determine if Labor would support the bill. 
'What I'd say is it's a distraction from Peter Dutton's hopeless mismanagement of his portfolio,' she told reporters on the Gold Coast. 
'It is extraordinary that, three years on, the government has not found third countries to resettle those people who are in limbo on Manus Island and Nauru.' She said Mr Dutton needed to find a permanent resettlement option for these people left in limbo.

Amanda Taub, New York Times, November 1, 2016 
Call it the crisis of whiteness. 
White anxiety has fueled this year's political tumult in the West: Britain's surprising vote to exit the European Union, Donald J. Trump's unexpected capture of the Republican presidential nomination in the United States, the rise of right-wing nationalism in Norway, Hungary, Austria and Greece. 
Whiteness, in this context, is more than just skin color. You could define it as membership in the 'ethno-national majority,' but that's a mouthful. What it really means is the privilege of not being defined as 'other.' 
Whiteness means being part of the group whose appearance, traditions, religion and even food are the default norm. It's being a person who, by unspoken rules, was long entitled as part of 'us' instead of 'them.' 
{snip} 
'It's fundamentally about 'who are we?'' said Eric Kaufmann, a professor of politics at Birkbeck College, University of London. 'What does it mean to be part of this nation? Is it not 'our' nation anymore, 'our' meaning the ethnic majority? 
'These kinds of questions are really front and center, even though they're not necessarily verbalized.' 
The questions can seem like a sudden reversal after decades of rising multiculturalism, through the civil rights movement in the United States and the European Union's opening up of borders. 
{snip} 
White people's officially privileged status waned over the latter half of the 20th century with the demise of discriminatory practices in, say, university admissions. But rising wages, an expanding social safety net and new educational opportunities helped offset that. Most white adults were wealthier and more successful than their parents, and confident that their children would do better still. 
That feeling of success may have provided a sort of identity in itself. 
But as Western manufacturing and industry have declined, taking many working-class towns with them, parents and grandparents have found that the opportunities they once had are unavailable to the next generation. 
That creates an identity vacuum to be filled. 
'For someone who is lower income or lower class,' Professor Kaufmann explained, 'you're going to get more self-esteem out of a communal identity such as ethnicity or the nation than you would out of any sort of achieved identity.' 
{snip} 
A recent Gallup study found that Mr. Trump's supporters tend to earn above-average incomes for their communities, but also tend to live in majority-white areas where children are likely to be worse off than their parents. 
{snip} 
The formal rejection of racial discrimination in those societies has, by extension, constructed a new, broader national identity. The United States has a black president; London has a Muslim mayor of Pakistani descent. 
But that broadening can, to some, feel like a painful loss, articulated in the demand voiced over and over at Trump rallies, pro-Brexit events and gatherings for populist parties throughout Europe: 'I want my country back.' 
The mantra is not all about bigotry. Rather, being part of a culture designed around people's own community and customs is a constant background hum of reassurance, of belonging. 
The loss of that comforting hum has accelerated a phenomenon that Robin DiAngelo, a lecturer and author, calls 'white fragility''“the stress white people feel when they confront the knowledge that they are neither special nor the default; that whiteness is just a race like any other. 
Fragility leads to feelings of insecurity, defensiveness, even threat. And it can trigger a backlash against those who are perceived as outsiders. 
{snip} 
For decades, the language of white identity has only existed in the context of white supremacy. When that became taboo, it left white identity politics without a vocabulary. 
If you are a working-class white person and you fear that the new, cosmopolitan world will destroy or diminish an identity you cherish, you have no culturally acceptable way to articulate what you perceive as a crisis. 
Some of these people have instead reached for issues that feel close to their concerns: trade, crime, the war on drugs, controlling the borders, fear of Islamist terrorism. All are significant in their own right, and create very real fears for many people, but they have also become a means to have a public conversation about what society's changes mean for white majorities. 
{snip} 
There will not likely be a return to the whiteness of social dominance and exclusive national identity. Immigration cannot be halted without damaging Western nations' economies; immigrants who have already arrived cannot be expelled en masse without causing social and moral damage. And the other groups who seem to be 'cutting in line' are in fact getting a chance at progress that was long denied them. 
Western whites have a place within their nations' new, broader national identities. But unless they accept it, the crisis of whiteness seems likely to continue.

Black Turnout Soft in Early Voting, Boding Ill for Hillary Clinton Jeremy Peters et al., New York Times, November 1, 2016 
African-Americans are failing to vote at the robust levels they did four years ago in several states that could help decide the presidential election, creating a vexing problem for Hillary Clinton as she clings to a deteriorating lead over Donald J. Trump with Election Day just a week away. 
{snip} 
The reasons for the decline appear to be both political and logistical, with lower voter enthusiasm and newly enacted impediments to voting at play. In North Carolina, where a federal appeals court accused Republicans of an 'almost surgical' assault on black turnout and Republican-run election boards curtailed early-voting sites, black turnout is down 16 percent . White turnout, however, is up 15 percent. Democrats are planning an aggressive final push, including a visit by President Obama to the state on Wednesday. 
But in Florida, which extended early voting after long lines left some voters waiting for hours in 2012, African-Americans' share of the electorate that has gone to the polls in person so far has decreased , to 15 percent today from 25 percent four years ago. 
The problems for Democrats do not end there. In Ohio, which also cut back its early voting, voter participation in the heavily Democratic areas near Cleveland, Columbus and Toledo has been down, though the Clinton campaign said it was encouraged by a busy day on Sunday when African-American churches led voter drives across the state. 
{snip} 
The Clinton campaign believes it can close the gap, especially in North Carolina and Florida, by Election Day. And Democrats are seeing substantial gains in turnout for other key constituencies like Hispanics and college-educated women, which have the potential to more than make up for any drop-off in black voting.

It's Harder for Clinton Supporters to Respect Trump Backers Than Vice Versa John Gramlich, Pew Research, November 1, 2016 Given the rancorous tone and often highly personal nature of this year's presidential campaign, supporters of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump might be expected to hold similarly negative views of one another. But a new Pew Research Center survey finds that Clinton backers'“particularly highly educated ones'“have more difficulty respecting Trump supporters than the other way around. Nearly six-in-ten registered voters who back Clinton (58%) say they have a 'hard time' respecting someone who supports Trump for president; 40% say they have 'no trouble' with it. Nearly the opposite is true among Trump supporters, with 56% saying they have no trouble respecting someone who backs Clinton and 40% saying they do have trouble with it. Among Clinton supporters, those with a college degree have a harder time respecting someone who prefers Trump than those who have not graduated from college. About two-thirds (66%) of college graduates who back Clinton say they have a hard time, compared with a narrower majority (53%) among Clinton supporters who have not completed college. White women who back Clinton also are particularly likely to say they have difficulty respecting those who favor Trump: 68% say this, compared with a smaller share of white men (59%) and fewer nonwhites.

Loading Posted on November 2, 2016 This Professor Devotes Her Life to Countering Dangerous Speech. She Can't Ignore Donald Trump's. Colby Itkowitz, Washington Post, October 24, 2016 
When Susan Benesch began looking at how speech could incite mass violence, her research took her to far-flung places like Kenya and Burma. 
Lately, she's been unable to ignore a case study at home in the United States. 
The American University law professor and Harvard University faculty associate has grappled for months with whether Donald Trump's rhetoric constitutes dangerous speech as she has come to define it. She has examined election-year speech before, but only abroad where the risks of mass atrocities were great. 
But in the past week, with Trump claiming that the election system and the media are rigged against him, his messages have the type of undertone that increases the risk of violence between groups, she said. 
Benesch, 52, has dedicated the past six years of her life to developing and testing a framework for identifying dangerous speech. To rise to that level, at least two of these five indicators must be true: A powerful speaker with a high degree of influence over the audience. The audience has grievances and fears that the speaker can cultivate. A speech act that is clearly understood as a call to violence. A social or historical context that is propitious for violence, for any of a variety of reasons, including long-standing competition between groups for resources, lack of efforts to solve grievances or previous episodes of violence. A means of dissemination that is influential in itself, for example because it is the sole or primary source of news for the relevan t audience. 
'Trump's speech is very difficult in the sense that he is so often slippery with it,' Benesch said in a recent interview. 'The meaning is so often ambiguous.' 
But when Trump said his supporters could use the Second Amendment against Hillary Clinton, 'it seems to me impossible that people didn't understand that as a reference to violence,' she said. Or when he suggested that Clinton and President Obama were founders of the Islamic State, something he alluded to again at Wednesday's final debate, that was a 'hallmark of dangerous speech to describe an in-group member as the enemy,' she said. 
And now, with Trump trafficking in the conspiracy theory that if he loses the election it will be because of a rigged system against him, he's definitely laying the groundwork for potential unrest after the balloting. Direct incitement of violence is illegal, but Trump falls short of actually calling for any kind of civil disobedience. 
Because of that, it's still a gray area that surrounds whether Trump does use dangerous speech. 
'Trump may well be undermining the extent to which his supporters trust the essential institutions and practices of U.S. democracy,' Benesch said. 'Some of them'“those who are most susceptible to being inflamed by such messages'“may therefore be more likely to commit violence. However, the United States is not in danger of mass intergroup violence, in my view. It is deeply irresponsible, though, since it can undermine some Americans' belief in our own democratic institutions, which can make them more susceptible to dangerous speech going forward.'

Poll: How Millennials View BLM and the Alt-Right Susan Page and Karina Shedrofsky, USA Today, October 31, 2016 
Most Millennials have a positive view of the Black Lives Matter movement, a USA TODAY/Rock the Vote Millennial Poll finds, but attitudes are more mixed about the less well-known alt-right. 
In the survey of Americans 18 to 34 years old, 58% say they have a favorable opinion about Black Lives Matter, an activist movement that grew from protests over the shooting deaths of unarmed African Americans. Among blacks, an overwhelming 81% have a favorable view, including 50% who are 'very favorable.' Just 14% of blacks have an unfavorable opinion. 
Whites have a positive impression of the movement by 53%-39%, Hispanics by 64%-31%, and Asian Americans by 54%-40%. 
{snip} 
The online poll of 1,299 young adults, including an over-sample of minorities, was taken Oct. 21-24 by Ipsos Public Affairs. {snip} 
The alt-right movement, which includes groups on the far right, has gained attention recently because of the support for Donald Trump by some white supremacists and anti-Semites. But it is much less well-known among Millennials. Nearly half of those surveyed, 45%, say they don't know enough about the alt-right to have an opinion of it, compared with just 8% who say that of Black Lives Matter. 
Among those who express an opinion, 34% say they have a favorable opinion of the alt-right, 21% an unfavorable one. 
Among whites, the favorable-unfavorable divide is 33%-19%. Among African Americans, it is 31%-27%. Among Hispanics, 46%-23%. Among Asian Americans, 37%-23%.

Charles H.F. Davis III, Inside Higher Ed, November 1, 2016 
{snip} 
The recent case involving a first-generation Latina student , Tiffany MartÃ­nez, at Suffolk University, is but one example. An accomplished undergraduate, published journal author and McNair scholar, MartÃ­nez wrote a personal blog post titled 'Academia, Love Me Back.' In her heartfelt plea, MartÃ­nez first recounts an experience she described as both disrespectful and invalidating and then explains that a sociology professor accused her of plagiarism, not privately, but in front of the entire class. The professor's claim was further illustrated by emphatic written statements on her paper such as 'this is not your word' and 'please go back and indicate where you cut and paste.' 
One such comment was written in the margin near the word 'hence,' which the professor had circled, an important detail, given MartÃ­nez merely used it as an appropriate transition to connect two related sentences. Was it that surprising to MartÃ­nez's professor that she knew how to appropriately use a transitional word? 
Although some may dismiss this as a minor incident, MartÃ­nez reminds us of the internalized racism and self-doubt resulting from years of educational violence. Like the many students of color from whom we hear similar stories in our campus climate assessments , what transpired for MartÃ­nez was yet another debilitating and painful experience of marginalization.

It is imperative that our colleagues stop being surprised when students of color are able to thoughtfully articulate themselves in their writing and in class discussions. {snip}

White Students Start Whites-Only Group to Wreck White Racism Quincy Clarke, Campus Reform, November 2, 2016 
A number of white Pomona College students formed a new club called 'We've Got Work To Do: White People for Deconstructing Whiteness.' The club, open to students from all five of the Claremont Colleges, aims to 'work on owning our racism, deconstructing our Whiteness, and to engage in movement & action toward dismantling White Supremacy.' 
'White people at the 5C's: we're all racist. we're all microaggressive. [W]e are all not only complicit in, but actively perpetuating white supremacy,' states an advertisement for the group. 'Pretending that we are not racist and hoping that no one will discover our racism really doesn't cut it. [W]e need to ACTIVELY be doing work to deconstruct our whiteness (and holding our peers accountable in doing the same).' 
'Recognizing that White identity is a self-fashioned, hierarchical fantasy, Whites should attempt to dismantle Whiteness as it currently exists,' explains the group's Facebook page , quoting Ian Haney LÃ³pez, a leading racial justice scholar. 'Whites should renounce their privileged racial character, though not simply out of guilt or any sense of self-deprecation. Rather, they should dismantle the edifice of Whiteness because this mythological construct stands at the vortex of racial inequality in America.'

Call for Action to Tackle Growing Ethnic Segregation Across UK Anushka Asthana and Nazia Parveen, Guardian, November 1, 2016 
Politicians must urgently tackle the increasing ethnic polarisation of many of Britain's towns and cities, according to a senior academic, as he revealed figures showing how rapidly the white British population had dwindled in urban 'pockets' across England. 
Prof Ted Cantle, who first authored a report into community cohesion after a series of race riots in 2001, said his new study showed that in the most extreme cases the white British population had more than halved in two decades. 
Cantle, who co-authored the report with Prof Eric Kaufmann at Birkbeck, University of London, told the Guardian that white British families should be encouraged to remain in ethnically diverse areas to reduce the trend. 
He warned that segregated societies 'breed intolerance and prejudice', adding: 'And we know the opposite is true'“there is a huge amount of research that shows any form of contact does break down stereotypes.' 
The leading academic said he would not describe the trend as white flight because that indicated that people were moving because of ethnic mixing, while this research only established the facts and not necessarily the causes. 
'White people are leaving urban areas in a disproportionate number'“and they avoid moving to diverse areas when they do move. But we can't say that is white flight because the motivations are many and various,' he said, arguing it could be to do with the dream of a place in the country or an older cohort retiring to rural communities. 
But he said interviews he had carried out in recent years as part of the study had highlighted a sense among some white British people that an area they had lived in was 'no longer for them'. 
In one case a community cohesion officer in Yorkshire told Cantle he was the first Asian to move into a particular street and that within three years virtually every white British family had gone. 'Some of those families made no bones about it, they said they are moving out because 'they' are moving in,' he said. 
The research looked at two existing studies and drew from census data from 1991, 2001 and 2011'“examining the figures in a way that has not been done before. 
The report authors stressed that the findings were nuanced, with more diversity in some areas, and different ethnic groups mixing together. 
However, when looking at the white British population compared with all other ethnicities together it found increasing polarisation, with the steepest decline in the white population in 'urban pockets' where the numbers were already well below the national average. 
Some of the largest declines were in Slough, where the white population fell from 58.3% to 34.5%, in Birmingham, where it went from 65.6% to 53.1% and in Leicester, where it decreased from 60.5% to 45.1%. 
In one London borough, Newham, the figure was just 16.7% in the latest data set. 
But the study found even more marked changes when it examined the figures at ward level. In one part of the Blackburn and Darwen authority area 7.8% of the population was white British, down from 42.3% in 1991. 
Smaller council areas in Birmingham saw similar declines, from 40.4% to 11.2% in Small Heath and from 30.7% to 7.2% in Handsworth. The trend was repeated in parts of Bradford, Luton and across London boroughs. 
Green St East in Newham had a white British population of 31.6% in 1991. Twenty years later is had declined to just 4.8%. While Southall Green, in Ealing, went from 18.9% to 4.6% in the same period. 
Meanwhile, there were only tiny changes in ethnic diversity in the most predominantly white areas, such as Barrow-in-Furness, mid-Devon, Bassetlaw and Mid Sussex. 
'The focus of policy needs to shift; this is not just about minorities,' said Cantle. 'Politicians and policymakers need to encourage white British residents to remain in diverse areas; to choose, rather than avoid, diverse areas when they do relocate, encouraging similar choices with respect to placing pupils in diverse schools; in other words to create a positive choice for mixed areas and a shared society.' 
Cantle called for 'salesmanship' of the positive benefits of mixed areas, including the cultural choices, and activities. We've never sold the idea that mixed communities are more exciting places with more going on,' he said, adding that after the Brexit vote there had been a bit of move in the opposite directions with the immediate surge in hate crime. 
But he also argued that some negative practices ought to be stamped out'“including businesses recruiting workers from single, eastern European countries. 
The publication of the report triggered an immediate debate with experts claiming that the diversity in areas with fewer white British families meant segregation was the wrong description. 'It is simply wrong to suggest that inner cities have become more 'ethnically segregated'. In fact, people are more likely to live near those of a different ethnicity than ever before. What is undoubtedly true is that more needs to be done to promote integration'“and not just in the most diverse areas,' said the economist, Jonathan Portes. 
However, Cantle's report argues that polarisation between the white British majority and other ethnic groups is a significant fact that requires urgent action. 
Cantle's research comes after the government was accused of sitting on a major study into community cohesion by Dame Louise Casey. The study is thought to include some uncomfortable findings. 
Casey, whose report has been finalised, will warn that successive governments have failed to do enough to tackle the difficult issues raised by Cantle 15 years ago. 
She is expected to suggest that faith schools should make their pupils mix with children of other religions, in a report that she has promised will be 'making the difficult choices and telling the truth'. 
It is not clear why her review has not yet been published although sources have pointed out that much has changed since she was first appointed by the then prime minister, David Cameron, including the EU referendum result and a new government. The government insists the review will be out by the end of the year. 
Chuka Umunna MP, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on social integration, said the report from Cantle and Kauffman laid 'bare the striking pace of change in some of our communities'. 
In a foreward to the study, he argued there were consequences for policymakers. 'It is clear we cannot carry on with a laissez-faire approach to integration in our country. Integration is a two-way street and all parts of society have a role to play in preventing the UK becoming more fragmented. 
'If we fail to do so, we risk sleepwalking into a situation where the divisions exposed during the EU referendum campaign become deeper as we grapple with the challenges thrown up by globalisation.'

War on the Streets of Paris: Armed Migrants Fight Running Battles in the French Capital Nick Gutteridge, Express, November 2, 2016 
A migrant turf war erupted into violence on the streets of one of Paris' trendiest neighbourhoods early this morning as asylum seekers beat each other to a pulp with wooden clubs. 
The area around Stalingrad Metro station was turned into a refugee battleground as rival gangs of migrants set upon each other in shocking scenes of violence. 
Asylum seekers wearing hooded tops wielded makeshift clubs fashioned from lengths of wood which they used to bludgeon each other as horrified pedestrians looked on. 
The blood-curdling brawl erupted just yards from the Stalingrad Metro station, where a squalid migrant camp has popped up following the demolition of the Jungle. 
It was not immediately clear what sparked the early morning fight, but rival gangs of people smugglers have previously been involved in violent brawls in Calais. 
And despite the horrific brawl, a pro-migrant rally is apparently being organised to take place at the camp at 6pm tonight. 
The once peaceful neighbourhood, in Paris' 10th Arrondissement, used to be a popular area with tourists, boasting a lively nightlife scene bustling with restaurants and bars. 
But worried residents have revealed how it has become a no go zone in recent weeks following the establishment of the refugee camp, which has brought squalor and violence. 
Thousands of migrants'“mostly from Sudan, Libya, Afghanistan, and Eritrea'“have pitched tents under the Metro station after the demolition of the Jungle hampered their attempts to reach Britain. 
French police have tried and failed on many occasions to clear the squalid squat, but asylum seekers simply keep on returning and reestablishing it. 
There are now nore than 2,500 migrants pitching up in the makeshift camp, with locals saying the eyesore is ruining their businesses and making life a 'living hell'. 
Residents in the once popular district say that the squatters are now becoming increasingly violent and dangerous, with increased reports of muggings. 
Faisal, a shopkeeper, told the French daily Le Figaro that Stalingrad locals are living in fear, threatening the future of his business. 
He said: 'The stench of urine, faeces, and rubbish has made Stalingrad an insalubrious place to live. The place is dead '“ no-one wants to come here anymore. People are afraid to go out and lock themselves in. 
'I'm making less than â‚¬60 (Â£53) a day. A few more weeks like this and I'll go bust! 
'French people have been kind to them. I know they're desperate, but the least they can do is respect the law and try and integrate into French society.' 
Jeanne, another Stalingrad resident, told Le Figaro the migrants had become increasingly violent towards locals. 
She said: 'Brazen migrants are snatching jewellery and handbags off passers-by'“they're even stealing bread. I've seen them beat people up too.' 
Police have raided the camp some 30 times in the past year, and on Monday French president FranÃ§ois Hollande vowed to close the camp for good. 
But within 24 hours of a police operation to move migrants on tents had sprung up again, showing the uphill battle authorities in the French capital face to shut down such illegal encampments. 
Furious locals have demanded that the camp be closed once and for all, describing how they have heard 'blood-curdling noises' coming from it in the middle of the night. 
Marie, who lives right next to the makeshift camp, told Le Figaro: 'Life here has become unbearable. More than 2,500 squatters were evacuated in September, and now, less than two months later, they're back. And now that the 'Jungle' camp has been closed, things are about to get even worse.' 
Another local, Monique, said that she was at 'a loss for words' and 'utterly distraught' over the situation. 
She said: 'The streets are littered with rubbish and faeces. We can hear blood-curdling screams coming from the camp in the middle of the night.

Beneath a Close Election Contest Lie Deep Rifts Among Groups Gary Langer et al., ABC News, November 3, 2016 
Profound rifts among groups lie beneath the close presidential contest, underscoring the country's fundamental political divisions not only by gender, education, race and ethnicity but also by factors ranging from religious belief to residential area. 
{snip} 
There's a 22 point gender gap in the contest, nearly double the norm in elections since 1976. And that pales compared with other gaps'“44 points between college- and non-college-educated whites, 65 points between whites and nonwhites, 66 points between rural and urban residents and 97 points between white evangelicals and likely voters who don't profess a particular religion. 
{snip} 
Trump is doing less well with Republicans and GOP leaners who wanted someone else to win the nomination; he has 75 percent support in this group, with 15 percent going to Clinton, 7 percent to Johnson or Stein. Two factors mitigate the damage: leaning Republicans have grown more apt to say they supported Trump in the first place (47 percent, up from 40 percent in August), and there's no slippage evident in turnout among leaning Republicans who preferred someone else for the nomination. 
{snip} 
Differences among groups abound, with one of the largest between evangelical white Protestants'“a core Republican constituency'“and those who profess no religion. The former back Trump by 77 to 19 percent; the latter, Clinton by 64 to 25 percent. The groups are identical in size, each making up 17 percent of likely voters. The gap between them is typical. 
{snip} 
The racial gap, while wide, is narrower than typical. Whites support Trump by 53 to 39 percent; nonwhites favor Clinton, 72 to 21 percent. But that 65 point divide is a bit smaller than the average in exit polls since 1976, 73 points, as well as 26 points smaller than the record racial gap, 91 points, in 1984. That's mostly because of lower support for Clinton among nonwhites who are not black or Hispanic; 48 percent back her, versus 66 percent for Barack Obama in 2012. 
In a particularly prominent result in this election, gender and education continue to spell broad differences among whites. College-educated white women, consistently strong for Clinton all year, now back her by 59 to 32 percent. Non-college-educated white men, steadily one of Trump's best groups, support him 64 to 26 percent. 
White men with a college degree continue to divide closely, making them a battleground group. Non-college-educated white women'“the largest of these groups, at 24 percent of likely voters'“have wavered in their support, generally for Trump but by varying margins. Lately, they look more settled on Trump, now by 61 to 33 percent.

Francis Wilkinson, Bloomberg, November 1, 2016 
The class compositions of the Republican and Democratic parties keep evolving. {snip} 
A Pew Research Center report last month detailed the shift. 
Since 1992, the share of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters with at least a college degree has increased sharply, from 21 percent to 37 percent. Among Republicans, 31 percent have at least a college degree, up only slightly from 28 percent in 1992. As a consequence, a greater proportion of Democrats than Republicans now have a college degree or more education. 
In the New York Times last week, political sage Thomas Edsall called this process the 'Great Democratic Inversion.' 
What these figures suggest is that the 2016 election will represent a complete inversion of the New Deal order among white voters. From the 1930s into the 1980s and early 1990s, majorities of downscale whites voted Democratic and upscale whites voted Republican. Now, looking at combined male and female vote totals, the opposite is true. 
A key word in Edsall's analysis is 'white.' Stories about the disaffected working-class supporters of Donald Trump apply almost exclusively to white voters. Other working-class voters'“blacks and Hispanics '“are poised to provide lopsided support to Hillary Clinton. 
{snip} 
There is no expansive, working-class rage in the U.S. There is white conservative rage (along with a more modest left-wing version). While it may burn brightest in deindustrialized America, conservative rage extends across class and educational demarcations, from blue collars to billionaires . 
This complicates the story of the parties switching class allegiances. For Democrats, it leaves them managing an increasingly unwieldy coalition extending from white cosmopolitan millionaires who send their kids to private schools to low-paid Hispanic service workers and black factory and office workers facing economic dislocation. {snip} 
Keeping that coalition pointed in the same general direction might be impossible without the dedicated efforts of the Republican Party. The GOP has proved incapable of breaking out of its racial straitjacket. So it has opted instead to tighten the straps around its torso. 
{snip} 
Republicans' constant struggle with racism in their ranks, and their recurring failure to resist the temptation to exploit it, eases pressure on the Democrats' sprawling coalition. The parties won't fully exchange their class identities for the simple reason that working-class blacks and Hispanics can't trust the GOP to represent them. 
If it doesn't diversify and become more accommodating to nonwhites, the GOP will only grow crazier and scarier , and its effort to wield power with the support of a shrinking white base will become even more extreme. {snip}

U-M's New 'Chief Diversity Officer' Will Collect $385,000 per Year Derek Draplin, Michigan Capitol Confidential, October 28, 2016 
The University of Michigan's new chief diversity officer will collect $385,000 a year under his various job titles, including a new one created by a recently revealed $85 million, five-year U-M diversity plan . 
Robert Sellers' appointment to a new position called 'vice provost for equity and inclusion and chief diversity officer' (VPEI-CDO) was approved Oct. 20 by the university's governing board. Sellers previously served as 'vice provost for equity and inclusion,' and is also listed as a professor of both psychology and education. In 2014-15 Sellers was paid $347,295 in his capacity as vice provost, a position created in 2014. 
President Mark Schlissel nominated Sellers for the job several weeks ago. The new full-time administrative position 'will serve as a leadership voice on diversity, equity and inclusion for the entire university.' 
The diversity plan Sellers will oversee will spend $17 million a year over the next five years. It seeks to 'recruit, retain and develop a diverse university community' and 'support innovation and inclusive scholarship and teaching' through a number of new and expanded programs. 
The $85 million plan is in addition to the $40 million a year the university already spends promoting diversity.

Family Remembers Queens Sucker Punch Victim 'He Was The Best Man I Knew' CBS New York, October 2, 2016 
The NYPD is looking for a killer who walked up to a stranger and punched him for apparently no reason. 
Authorities are looking for two suspects in connection with the sucker punch attack of a Queens man just after midnight on June 26th. His family says he had taken a bus home after attending a Baltimore Orioles game. 
The NYPD released new surveillance video Wednesday of the assault, which police said happened outside 64-year-old Patrick Gorman's home on the corner of Queens Boulevard and Main Street just after midnight on June 26. 
In the video, police said a man can be seen approaching Gorman and punching him in the head, knocking him to the ground. The man is then joined by a woman and calmly walks away as Gorman is seen struggling to get up. 
Gorman was taken to Jamaica Hospital, where he died nine hours later after suffering a stroke and brain hemorrhage. {snip} Patrick Gorman

Nigel Farage Fears Brexit 'Betrayal' and Warns of 'Public Anger' Following Historic Article 50 Ruling Chris Kitching, Mirror, November 3, 2016 
Nigel Farage has warned fellow politicians that any attempt to block or delay Britain's exit from the European Union will be met with untold anger from the public. 
In a statement released after the historic High Court ruling on Article 50 the interim Ukip leader said he fears a Brexit 'betrayal' is on the horizon. 
The judges ruled that the government doesn't have the power to trigger two-year exit process Article 50 without a vote by MPs. 
Farage campaigned vigorously for Brexit and declared the June 23 referendum Britain's 'independence day' after the shock result was confirmed. 
After the High Court ruling was announced on Thursday morning Farage said: 'I worry that a betrayal may be near at hand. 
'Last night at the Spectator Parliamentary Awards I had a distinct feeling that our political class, who were out in force, do not accept the 23rd of June Referendum result. 
'I now fear that every attempt will be made to block or delay the triggering of Article 50 . 
'If this is so, they have no idea of the level of public anger they will provoke.' 
Three of England's top judges gave the ruling after a costly three-day hearing. 
The Government immediately announced it would appeal to the Supreme Court. 
Ukip millionaire donor Arron Banks accused the 'legal establishment' of 'declaring war on British democracy'. 
He added: 'Parliament voted six-to-one in favour of letting the people decide. 
'They didn't get the answer they wanted, and now they're going to use every dirty trick in the book to try to sabotage, delay or water down Brexit.' 
Ukip leadership hopeful Suzanne Evans blasted the judges and said the court ruling 'undermines democracy'. 
The former party chair urged the government to appeal. 
She wrote on Twitter : 'How dare these activist judges attempt to overturn our will? It's a power grab & undermines democracy. Time we had the right to sack them. 
' Article 50 is an EU trap we must not fall in to. It will tie us into the EU for years. The government must appeal. People power must win.' 
Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said: 'This ruling underlines the need for the Government to bring its negotiating terms to parliament without delay. 
'Labour respects the decision of the British people to leave the European Union. 
'But there must be transparency and accountability to parliament on the terms of Brexit . 
'Labour will be pressing the case for a Brexit that works for Britain, putting jobs, living standards and the economy first.' 
Liberal Democrats Leader Tim Farron welcomed the ruling. 
He said: 'Given the strict two year timetable of exiting the EU once Article 50 is triggered, it is critical that the government now lay out their negotiating to Parliament, before such a vote is held.'

Loading Posted on November 3, 2016 'Go Away, You Shouldn't Be Here. Don't Come Back': The Corner of Yorkshire That Has Almost No White Residents Sue Reid, Daily Mail, November 3, 2016 
From the window of her flat overlooking the canal path in a suburb of Dewsbury in Yorkshire, a blonde woman watches two female figures walking past as they chatter in a foreign tongue. 
Both the passers-by are covered in black Islamic gowns, only a glimpse of their eyes show from in the two gaps in the veils across their faces. 
They, like many Muslim women who live here, speak little or no English. Lots of them will have no contact with any person from another religion or culture. Almost all have been brought to the UK to wed the British men of south Asian heritage who have made this area their home. 
The wives have restricted lives: bringing up children, cooking for families, or going to women-only events at the huge local mosque run by the Deobandis, a powerful sect of Islam whose most outspoken preachers have urged followers not to mix with Christians, Jews or Hindus. 
We are in Savile Town, one of the most racially homogeneous parts of Britain: not because everyone is an indigenous Yorkshire man or woman, but exactly the opposite. 
In fact there are almost no white residents to be found in Savile Town. Astonishingly, a detailed breakdown of the last census of 2011 recorded that only 48 of the 4,033 people living here were white British. 
This would not surprise the blonde Lorraine Matthews, looking out at the ladies in burkas from her window. She is a 53-year-old dentist's receptionist, one of the handful of white Britons left in Savile Town's grid of terrace streets. Almost all the other residents, according to that census, have Pakistani or Indian backgrounds. 
Their forebears were enticed to Savile Town as cheap labour for back-breaking jobs in the woollen mills which had made Dewsbury a renowned textile town. 
These hard-working newcomers bought their own homes, and opened corner shops that sold burkas, prayer mats and perfumes that contained no alcohol, in line with the strictures of the Koran. 
Soon the new arrivals had built the mosque which is designed to accommodate 4,000 worshippers. Today, a Sharia court nearby'“criticised in a House of Lords report for discriminating against women in divorce and matrimonial disputes'“does brisk business espousing the strict Islamic justice code. 
Even the lady selling ice creams from a van during the summer wears a burka, and the mobile butcher going round the streets offers only halal goat, lamb and ostrich. 
Stand in Savile Town, as I have, and you will see scores of boys in Islamic robes walking to and from lessons at the mosque's madrasah school, where for hours at a time they rote-learn the Koran by heart. 
And, distressingly, every girl I saw'“even those of six and seven playing in the park'“was wrapped up in a hijab and shoulder-to-toe-gown lest a man glimpse her flesh. 
Eight of the nine pubs in the area have shut because there are hardly any local customers who drink alcohol. The hair salon, once giving stern perms to Yorkshire ladies, closed down long ago, the Western grocery and clothes shops, too. 
Needless to say, with nowhere to socialise or shop for what they like, the local white folk departed, first in a trickle, then a torrent. 
Savile Town was left to become an ethnic enclave. And it seems that this detachment from mainstream society had disturbing repercussions. For this small area has produced several young jihadists who disappeared to fight'“and die as suicide bombers'“for Islamic State in the Middle East. 
(Mohammed Sidique Khan, the leader of the bombers who attacked London on July 7, 2005, was brought up nearby. He bade farewell to his pregnant wife at their terrace house before leading his fellow attackers to the capital to claim 52 innocent lives in explosions on Tube trains and buses.) 
Life in Savile Town was investigated earlier this year by Owen Bennett-Jones, the BBC's former Pakistan correspondent, who threw light on the influence of the Deobandi movement over the Muslim population here. 
Interviewed for the Radio 4 programme was Mufti Mohammed Pandor, a civil servant and spokesman for the Deobandis. He arrived from India's Gujarat in 1964 as a small child with his family. 
He lives near Savile Town, and would call himself a British Muslim. Yet he refused to let interviewer Bennett-Jones see his wife when the reporter visited the couple's home, although she was permitted to make the tea in the kitchen. 
Pandor insists she is completely covered at almost all times, allowing her only to raise her veil for passport checks at airports. His family rarely watches British TV and says all music is un-Islamic. 
Despite being a religious adviser to two universities'“Bradford and Huddersfield'“he told the BBC that Muslim men should only be permitted to enter higher education institutions to study and pray, and 'not to look at women'. 
'If Mohammed did not do it, we don't do it,' Pandor told the BBC, saying the Deobandi are a 'back to basics' movement whose followers live in the style of the Prophet's life, 14 centuries ago. 
You might dismiss such desperately backward thinking as being the preserve of a small outlandish sect, but the Deobandis run nearly half the 1,600 registered UK mosques, and train 80 per cent of all domestic Islamic clerics who, in turn, play a huge part in influencing the growing population of British Muslims. 
Perhaps it's little surprise that the few indigenous Yorkshire people remaining in Savile Town feel somewhat beleaguered. 
Lorraine Matthews, in the house near the canal, is outspoken in her comments about the community in which she now lives: 'I wouldn't go out at night on my own as it is dangerous if you're not from the Muslim community. It isn't sensible for a woman to walk there after dark. The Asian lads gather on the corners, they make you feel intimidated because they don't respect white women.' 
When I myself walked down South Street towards the mosque, figures in burkas peered out of their lace-curtained windows in surprise at seeing an uncovered woman's face. 
I asked one tall teenager, wearing an Islamic cap and white robes over his jeans, for directions to the mosque entrance. His response was to spit at me and shout: 'Go away, you shouldn't be here. Don't come back.' 
It is depressing to be confronted with such aggression. And I've no doubt many Muslims, too, will feel distressed at such behaviour. Not all British followers of Islam wish to live in areas where people of other faiths or cultures might fear to tread. 
Yet in places such as Savile Town, the omens are not good. 
For however unpalatable it may be to British liberals, the fact is that many Muslims here only want to live with those from their own culture. 
Indeed, some of the few remaining non-Muslim residents say they are regularly targeted by members of the local Islamic community who want to buy their houses. 
Some have even received a knock on the door from complete strangers in religious robes offering wads of cash in plastic bags to purchase their homes. 
Yorkshire-born Jean Wood, 76, a church-goer, is one long-time resident who feels that she is being edged out. Her children beg her to move to an area where she can share her retirement with the kind of people she grew up with. 
At her neat home on the edge of Savile Town, she told me the tale of what happened a day after her husband died suddenly while sitting at the kitchen table. 
'He had not gone 24 hours when a Muslim neighbour pushed a note through the door saying she wanted to buy this house,' she remembers. 'We had lived here all our married life. I was grieving, although the note did not mention my loss. 
'But I gathered my strength. I phoned the number on the piece of paper and said my home was not for sale and never would be in my lifetime.' 
They were brave words, but'“inevitably'“the Deobandis' spokesman Mufti Pandor views it differently. 
He described, on Radio 4, how 'white flight' ensued when his family came to Savile Town. 'Who was going to buy the house next door to us?' said Pandor. 'It certainly wasn't going to be a white guy . . . so my uncle bought it. Then there were two of us. So then guess what happened? The bloke opposite said: 'Bugger this, I'm going''“so he left.' 
It's not hard to see why, with suspicions running deep on both sides of the cultural divide, Savile Town is, for good or bad, changing for ever.

Hundreds of Migrants Protest in Paris over Their Treatment by French Authorities Julian Robinson and Peter Allen, Daily Mail, November 3, 2016 
Migrants have staged a mass protest in Paris over their treatment by French authorities following the destruction of their makeshift camps. 
Hundreds of refugees sleeping rough in the French capital joined local activists to demonstrate close to their encampment near the Stalingrad Metro station. 
One man held up a sign saying 'human, no beast' as a man used a loud speaker to lead the march, which happened late last night. 
It came 24 hours after violence broke out at the site with gangs of men attacking each other using sticks as makeshift clubs. 
The fighting unfolded just hours after demolition workers supported by riot police began smashing up an illegal camp full of UK-bound migrants in Paris. 
It also came in the wake of the destruction of the Calais Jungle which saw refugees transported around the country. It is not yet known what caused the fight in Paris. 
There had already been scuffles on Monday as mainly Afghans and Eritreans tried to save their possessions during the raid, which started soon after 8am. 
It followed thousands of migrants arriving in the French capital following the razing of the Calais Jungle refugee camp last week. 
While some 5,000 Jungle residents agreed to be bused to resettlement centres around France, many others headed off independently, saying they still wanted to get to Britain. 
Up to 3,000 set up tents on the pavements around the Stalingrad Metro station, which is close to the Gare du Nord Eurostar hub in the north of Paris. 
Shortly before Monday's clearance French president Francois Hollande said: 'We won't tolerate the camps any longer.' 
Referring to the Paris clearance, Mr Hollande said: 'We are going to carry out the same operation as in Calais.' 
CRS riot police around Stalingrad said there would be a 'gradual operation' which is likely to go on all week until all the camps are gone. 
Meanwhile, the first ever official centre for refugees in Paris is due to be opened by the city's Socialist council later this week. 
The Â£6m facility is also close to the Eurostar hub, and will have beds for 400 men. 
But local residents and business owners say it will attract people smugglers, and other criminals. 
Jean Brossard, who has been living in the area for 30 years, said: 'None of us asked for an immigrant centre on our doorsteps. 
'Everybody in the area is complaining. If these men want to go to England, then send them to England.' 
Others have accused the Socialists of tokenism, saying they are simply opening the camps as a humanitarian gesture that will have no long term effect on Europe's immigrant crisis. 
The official centre, which will include a football pitch, will only allow residents to stay for between five and 10 weeks, and is likely to shut down within two years. 
Another centre for women with children will also open in the Paris suburb of Ivry-sur-Seine later this year, or early next, but it too will only have a limited capacity of 350 temporary places. 
Meanwhile, French authorities have started transporting migrant children out of Calais to processing centres around France, amid tensions around the closure of the vast Jungle camp. 
Three buses carried a group of unaccompanied boys, mainly teenagers, out of the camp on Wednesday morning. 
French authorities transferred more than 5,000 adult migrants out of Calais last week, but the fate of its 1,500 unaccompanied children remained unclear. 
Migrants from the Middle East and Africa converged on the Jungle in hopes of crossing the English Channel to Britain. 
President Francois Hollande said this week that the children would be transferred within days to 'dedicated centres' where British officials can explore whether they have the right to UK asylum. 
Mr Hollande said the others would be put in the care of French child welfare services.

Posted on November 4, 2016 The French Fear Islamization but Do Nothing Guillaume Durocher, American Renaissance, November 2, 2016 Not even the Front National is prepared to act. 
In his classic study Democracy in America , Alexis de Tocqueville wrote about Southerners' attitudes towards the rapidly expanding population of Blacks: 
In the states of the South, they are quiet; they do not speak about the future to foreigners; they avoid explaining themselves with their friends; everyone is in denial about it even with themselves. There is something more frightening about the silence of the South than the noisy fears of the North. [1] 
Almost two centuries later, there is a similar attitude of denial among French politicians about the steady Afro-Islamization of France. Conservatives are happy to talk about 'Islamic totalitarianism,' 'secularism,' 'burkinis,' etc, but not the underlying problem, which is continued Muslim immigration. Socialists recognize the problem in private, but do nothing either to stop the flood of Africans and Muslims. There is something surreal about the situation. 
The most striking example of awareness combined with inactivity was provided recently by the publication of a book of exclusive interviews with our painfully uncharismatic and ineffectual president, the Socialist FranÃ§ois Hollande. Among Mr. Hollande's statements , one finds: On conservative politician Nadine Morano's saying that France is 'a country of the white race' (quoting Charles de Gaulle): 'I am convinced that, when one asks the French, the majority have her position. [. . .] They think: 'We are for the most part Whites. There are more Whites than others.' ' On Islamic immigration: 'There are at the same time things which work very well and the accumulation of potential bombs linked to a continuous immigration. Because it continues.' On the salience of race in politics: 'The Left cannot win on the theme of identity, but it can lose on the theme of identity.' On ethnic segregation and potential civil war: 'How can we avoid partition? Because that is really what is happening: partition.' 
Mr. Hollande recognizes that integration, let alone assimilation, is not happening and that 'at some point [immigration] will have to stop.' And yet, during his four years as president, he has done nothing to stop it. Instead, his government has radically increased the rate of naturalizations of foreigners , providing the flagging Socialists with thousands of new voters in time for national elections next spring. 
On the Right, we have the conservative party, now called 'Les RÃ©publicains,' led by former president Nicolas Sarkozy. He knows racial problems well, having made a career from a sort of low-level race-baiting while, as president, actually letting more immigrants settle in France than his Socialist predecessors. Mr. Sarkozy is also well aware of the medium-term existential threat to France. As he said recently at a political meeting: 
The Sahel will in 30 years have 200 million inhabitants. There are 6 to 8 children per family on average in the Sahel. Can we continue family reunification in these conditions? Is the future of the Sahel's children to end up in our cities' neighborhoods? Even though we have no jobs, no housing, and we no longer have the means to pay benefits for families who do not pay one cent in taxes. 
Well said! But can Mr. Sarkozy claim to have been unaware of these facts while he was president from 2007 to 2012? The end of family reunification would be welcome, but in the face of the demographic threat to France and all of Europe, this is like fending off a rhinoceros with a water-pistol. Other than this, Mr. Sarkozy has mainly been trying to win the conservative party primaries by complaining about 'burkinis' and demanding 'assimilation.' However, as a former adviser Patrick Buisson '“a Rightist who recently published a book on his disenchantment with Mr. Sarkozy'“has said: 'He is ready to say what is needed to get elected and to then do nothing.' French police ask a woman to remove some of her clothing to comply with a ban on 'burkinis.' 
The gravity of the situation is matched only by the sheer fecklessness of European politicians . According to United Nations statistics, the population of Europe (including a growing proportion of highly-fertile non-Whites) will stagnate and decline this century while that of Africa is set to quadruple to a whopping 4 billion. The most important, tragic, horrifying, ungodly, evil question facing Western Civilization and mankind this century is this: Will Europe turn African ? 
Books warning against Islamization, whether by journalists or second-rate politicians, top the best-seller lists, but most French people care more about welfare and pay checks than long-term considerations. Even on economic issues, they would rather stay in denial, vaguely hoping the problems of a heavily state-run French economy in an inefficient Eurozone monetary union will sort themselves out on their own, rather than ask hard questions. Ethno-religious questions are even more inconceivable. 
It is true that diversity is not yet an unmanageable problem in the daily lives of most Frenchmen, aside from the unpleasant evening news about Muslims shooting up hundreds of people at a rock concert, running down dozens of people with a truck on Bastille Day, or trying to burn policemen to death . Incidentally, the last time France's religious homogeneity was broken'“during the Protestant Reformation'“this led to a civil war between Catholics and Protestants. 
We are told that mass government surveillance, abrogation of civil liberties, and mass murder by the fanatics of a Middle Eastern religion are the price we pay for enjoying the fruits of diversity. And if you don't like it, you will join the scores of European patriots who have been fined and even jailed under anti-free-speech laws for 'inciting hatred.' (By the way, France has passed special laws to counter the Islamic terrorism. These same laws have been invoked to spy on thousands of patriots who have been designated as 'security threats.') 
Nonetheless, the current offering for next spring's presidential elections in France is dismal. Besides Mr. Hollande and Mr. Sarkozy, with whom the French are thoroughly disenchanted, there is the frontrunner in the conservative primaries, Alain JuppÃ©, a felon guilty of misusing public funds, who is proud of France's 'diversity.' He speaks of France's new 'happy identity,' and is being called a 'steady,' 'serious' candidate'“who will change nothing. As mayor of Bordeaux, he noted that 60 percent of the students in some of his schools are 'foreign-language speakers,' but appeared to think this was nothing worse than an exciting challenge. 
Then there is the eternal promise of the Front National, a party that has risen to unprecedented heights in polls and secondary elections. But this has come at a significant cost: Marine Le Pen has gone to great lengths to 'detoxify' the party and stay within the bounds acceptable to France's heavily policed and state-dependent mainstream media. The 'new FN' talks more about dismantling the European Union and the Euro than about identity and Islam, let alone race. 
Marine Le Pen is breaking no new ground in the fight against political incorrectness, in contrast with the Alternative for Germany's Frauke Petry on the other side of the Rhine. And yet, a solid two-thirds of French people still strongly oppose Miss Le Pen. She will probably reach the second-round runoff of the presidential elections and then lose in a landslide, though surely with a better score than her father's 18 percent in 2002. The majority of Frenchmen are likely to be repelled by the prospect of an FN government that represents the working classes and the ethnocentric fringe. The conservatives, for their part, have refused to work with the FN ever since the French branch of the B'nai B'rith asked them to in 1986 . Marine Le Pen 
The most groundbreaking politician in France today is probably the mayor of BÃ©ziers, Robert MÃ©nard, who, in a former life as a leftist, founded Reporters Without Borders, but now calls himself a reactionary. He has broken French law by counting the city's school children by religion'“he found that 65 percent were Muslim, judging from their first names. He wants to reinstate the death penalty, opposes homosexual marriage, and he visited a refugee center to tell the occupants they are not welcome in France. Recently he proposed a municipal referendum to reject the imposition of 'refugees' on his town. 
Disenchantment is severe among the French: 83 percent think Mr. Hollande is 'disqualified' as president due to his failure on unemployment. Two-thirds think Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Hollande were equally bad presidents , and a solid majority, continuously egged on by a hostile media, are 'worried' by Marine Le Pen . I am inclined to agree with best-selling author Ã‰ric Zemmour , whose latest book is Un Quinquennat Pour Rien ('A Five-Year Term for Nothing'), when he says that the next year's elections are pointless. 
Why is there such a divide between the aspirations of French voters and the politicians on offer? I believe this can be explained only by the authoritarian cliquishness of the French political system: The parties and the media serve as critical choke points to prevent the penetration of nationalist and identitarian movements that might appeal to a majority of the French people. No Trump-like figure'“half independent billionaire half media personality'“has emerged to break this stranglehold by uniting the nationalist fringe of the disenfranchised white working class with mainstream conservative voters. 
All this is depressing, but one must not forget that, as the great European historian Dominique Venner said: 'History is nothing but a set of strategic surprises.' The presidential elections are in April and May, and six months is a long time in politics. France cannot remain unaffected by the enormous political and cultural gains made in recent years by nationalists across the West. Happy surprises do happen. If Donald Trump were to win, this would set a patriotic and anti-immigration precedent for many Europeans governments. There is a long tradition of opportunistic European politicians slavishly following the American political and cultural lead. 
The mainstream political establishments across Europe are reeling from the economic crisis, the migrant invasion, and'“one must not underestimate this'“the mainstream media's own economic and legitimacy crisis due to the rise of alternative media. These establishments are merely trying, in a dull bovine reflex, to keep the ship on course without ever questioning their premises. But this is proving harder and harder. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who for her role in opening the floodgates to Afro-Islamic colonization is an objective enemy of Europe, is facing real problems. Her party, the so-called Christian-Democratic Union, has reached its lowest ever levels of support , falling to less than 30 percent. 
The critical media-political choke points of power in the 'democratic' West'“particularly in America, Germany, and France'“are more open for takeover than ever. If one or two go, particularly America, many of the rest are likely to follow. If we are lucky, a major shift towards national-populist governments could be possible. This would appeal to the great majority of our people and drastically reduce the pace of dispossession. And that could be a prelude for far greater things to come.

Illegal Immigrants Surging to US-Mexico Border in Race Against Election Day William La Jeunesse, Fox News, November 3, 2016 
Americans aren't the only ones motivated by Tuesday's election. The presidential race has immigrants from around the world racing to the U.S.-Mexican border, as the cartels exploit a powerful narrative: get into the U.S. while you still can. 
'Smugglers are telling them that they need to come across now while there's a chance,' said Art Del Cueto, a Border Patrol agent in Tucson, Ariz., whose views were echoed by another agent in Texas. 
'People think if one candidate wins, certain things will happen, like a giant wall being built and then they can never get through,' said Chris Cabrera, an agent in the Rio Grande Valley. 'Another faction believes that if the other candidate wins, they'll get amnesty if they're here by a certain date.' 
Those two competing narratives'“triggered by the rhetoric of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, respectively'“are driving immigration numbers the Border Patrol hasn't seen in years in some sectors. 
'We are overwhelmed,' said a veteran agent in McAllen, Texas. 'We are seeing 800 to 1,000 apprehensions every night.' 
In fiscal 2016, the Border Patrol apprehended 117,200 immigrants from Central America, almost one-third of all apprehensions border-wide'“and 5,000 more than during the so-called surge of 2014. The agency also apprehended 5,000 Haitians, up from just 700 last year. The number of immigrants claiming to be from Africa and Asia also is up. 
{snip} 
The poverty and violence plaguing many of these countries helps push immigrants north, Beeson said. Pull factors include available and good-paying jobs in the U.S. and immigration policy that provides work permits and freedom for immigrants while the courts adjudicate their 'asylum' claim. 
'When you stop somebody, you ask their name and the first thing they tell you is'“'I'm here for asylum, I can't go home because they'll kill me.' . . . When it takes a good five or six minutes just to get their name out of them, they have a rehearsed story,' said Cabrera. 'Once they get those papers saying they can pass through our checkpoint, we'll never see them again.' 
Del Cueto said the agents are 'not getting any backing' from D.C. and 'we need to start enforcing every single immigration law we have on the books.' 
Del Cueto and Cabrera belong to the National Border Patrol Council, which represents the Border Patrol's 18,000 field agents who are prohibited from talking openly to the media.

Immigration Surging; 1.5 Million Arriving Each Year Karen Zeigler and Steven A. CamarotaCenter for Immigration Studies, November 1, 2016 
A Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) analysis of newly released data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) shows that 1.5 million new immigrants (legal and illegal) settled in the country in 2014. The number who entered in 2014 represent an increase of 38 percent over the number who were arriving as recently as 2011. The findings confirm a CIS study published in June of this year based on other data showing a surge in legal and illegal immigration in 2014 and 2015. Newly arrived immigrants include new green card holders (permanent residents); long-term 'temporary' visitors who often stay permanently, such as guest workers and foreign students; and new illegal immigrants. 
View the entire report here . 
'The data makes clear that the slowdown in immigration that occurred after the Great Recession is over,' said the Center's Director of Research Steven Camarota. He added, 'many of these new arrivals are guest workers brought in at the behest of the business community. Whether this is in the best interest of American workers or the country as a whole is a question seldom asked in Washington.' 
' Newly released data show 1.5 million new immigrants (legal and illegal) arrived in 2014. Data released for the first six months of 2015 indicates that 1.6 million new immigrants likely arrived in 2015. 
' The number who arrived in 2014 represents a 17% increase over the number who came in 2013 and a 38 percent increase over the low point in 2011. 
' Between two-third and three-fourths of the 1.5 million new immigrants settling in the country are legal immigrants, including permanent residents as well as long-term visitors (e.g. guest workers and foreign students). The remainder are new illegal immigrants. 
' The overall immigrant population grew about twice as fast from 2013 to 2015 as it did in the prior four years, hitting a new record high of 43.3 million. 
' It is important to note that arrivals are offset by those immigrants who leave the country each year and by normal mortality of about 300,000 annually among the existing immigrant population. Therefore, growth in the overall immigrant population is less than new arrivals. 
' As a share of the U.S. population, 13.5 percent are now immigrants'“the highest percentage in 105 years. As recently as 1970, less than 5 percent of the population were immigrants. 
' Based on current trends and Census Bureau projections, the immigrant share of the population is on track to surpass the highest level in American history seven years from now. 
' Sending regions with the largest numerical increases in immigrants living in the United States since 2010 were East Asia (up 847,000), South Asia (up 825,000), the Caribbean (up 434,000), Sub-Saharan Africa (up 390,000), the Middle East (up 362,000), and Central America (up 332,000). The number of European immigrants declined by 31,000. 
' Major sending countries with the largest numerical increases in immigrants living in the United States since 2010 were India (up 609,000), China (up 510,000), the Philippines (up 205,000), the Dominican Republic (up 184,000), El Salvador (up 138,000), Cuba (up 106,000), Nigeria (up 104,000), Guatemala (up 97,000), Haiti (up 88,000), Pakistan (up 80,000), Honduras (up 76,000), Bangladesh (up 75,000), Venezuela (up 71,000), Colombia (up 63,000), Vietnam (up 60,000), and Iraq (up 55,000). 
' Major sending-countries with the largest percentage increases in immigrants living in the United States since 2010 were Saudi Arabia (up 115 percent), Bangladesh (up 49 percent), Nigeria (up 48 percent), Egypt and Iraq (each up 35 percent), India (up 34 percent), Ethiopia (up 32 percent), Pakistan (up 27 percent), Ghana (up 25 percent), the Dominican Republic (up 21 percent), Honduras (up 15 percent), Guatemala and the Philippines (each up 12 percent), and Iran (up 11 percent).

Pew: 8 Million Illegal Immigrant Workers in the U.S. in 2014 Joseph Lawler, Washington Examiner, November 3, 2016 
There were about 8 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. workforce in 2014, a number that didn't change significantly since the end of the Great Recession in 2009, according to the Pew Research Center. 
But as a share of the overall labor force, illegal immigrants have declined slightly from 2009 to 2014, from 5.2 percent to 5 percent. 
Thursday's report, written by researchers Jeffrey Passel and D'Vera Cohn and based on U.S. Census figures, indicates that the country's reliance on unauthorized labor hasn't changed much since the 2008 financial crisis, which drastically slowed or even reversed migration from Mexico. The report examines the illegal immigrant workforce up through 2014. 
Before the crisis, especially as the housing bubble inflated, the share of unauthorized labor soared, from below 3 percent of the labor force in the 1990s to 5.4 percent just prior to the crash.

About 10 percent of the illegal immigrant workforce has been protected from deportation, according to Pew, by executive orders from President Obama . Hillary Clinton has said that she will expand on those orders. {snip}

LAPD Investigating Boyle Heights Vandalism as Possible Hate Crimes Sparked by Gentrification Fight Brittny Mejia, Los Angeles Times, November 3, 2016 
The Los Angeles Police Department is treating three acts of vandalism in the last month targeting art galleries in Boyle Heights, including graffiti at one gallery that attacked 'white art,' as possible hate crimes. 
The probe comes amid a debate in the predominantly Latino Eastside neighborhood over the growing art scene there and whether it's part of a gentrification that some activists fear will push working-class families out. Galleries have been popping up in the area over the last few years as some artists get priced out of downtown's Arts District and other areas. 
'We don't know who actually did [the vandalism], but because it actually made a reference to anti-white art or anti-white, it's basically saying that it's a hate crime based on that,' Det. John Parra of the LAPD's Hollenbeck station said of a vulgar curse against 'white art' that in one of the incidents was spray-painted on the Nicodim Gallery. 
Boyle Heights has become a flashpoint as Los Angeles undergoes a wave of gentrification fueled by rising home prices and a renewed interest in urban neighborhoods by many. It's already transformed once-working-class communities such as Echo Park and Highland Park. But some in Boyle Heights'“for decades the heart of L.A.'s Mexican American community'“have vowed to fight the change. 
In the last three years, more than a dozen galleries have appeared in the area , many in an industrial zone just west of the 101 Freeway. Community activists fear the galleries will inflate property values and push poorer residents out. 
In September, activists marched through Boyle Heights and posted mock eviction notices for 'gentrifiers,' which included a couple of galleries. 
{snip} 
But the three incidents prompted the Hollenbeck Division to call a meeting with gallery owners last week to try to get an understanding of the problem and come up with a plan, including attempting to open a dialogue with the activist group Defend Boyle Heights, which has been a driving force of opposition to the galleries. 
{snip} 
On Thursday afternoon, Defend Boyle Heights issued a statement saying it was not responsible for vandalizing the galleries. 
'We don't know who tagged up these galleries, but we . . . certainly don't condemn it. It is right to rebel! We are glad to see the community rise up to resist displacement, art washing and gentrification'“however they see fit! Your anger is justified,' the statement read. 
'Gentrification is the true, highest form of hate crime!' 
Activists have demanded that the art galleries leave the neighborhood and allow the community to decide what will take their place.

Soros Spends $2 Million to Defeat Arpaio Scott Bland, Politico, November 4, 2016 
George Soros has contributed $2 million to a group working to defeat Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona, the latest target of Soros' big spending in local law enforcement campaigns over the past year. 
The Soros-funded PAC, Maricopa Strong, will file campaign finance documents Friday showing Soros' multi-million dollar investment against Arpaio, along with $500,000 from Texas energy billionaires Laura and John Arnold and $250,000 from Laurene Powell Jobs (the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs). The group had previously reported a $300,000 donation from Soros, one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors. 
Soros has spent millions in 2015 and 2016 funding campaigns to defeat local prosecutors around the country and elect new ones who back criminal justice reform measures. Soros-backed groups are currently spending big in three big-city district attorney races: Houston's Harris County, where Soros has contributed over $1 million, according to local campaign finance filings; Gilpin and Jefferson counties outside Denver, where Soros has given about $1.5 million to unseat an incumbent; and Phoenix's Maricopa County, where a Soros-funded PAC has also spent over $1 million against the Republican district attorney, Bill Montgomery. 
But Soros' spending against Arpaio, a high-profile liberal bogeyman, is his single biggest investment in a local race this year, as well as the billionaire's first effort against a sheriff. It folds in immigration reform, another policy passion of Soros', alongside criminal justice reform. 
{snip} 
Maricopa Strong has spent $2.9 million in the sheriff's race, with the donations from Soros and others funding a flurry of mailers and TV ads boosting Democratic candidate Paul Penzone and hammering Arpaio. Soros has typically been the sole funder of his local outside-spending campaigns around the country, though Jobs and the Arnolds joined him in funding Maricopa Strong. 
{snip} 
Arpaio's campaign has attacked Soros' efforts, calling him a 'far-left globalist,' saying he is trying to buy a local race, and alleging that his group has broken disclosure rules, per the Arizona Republic. 
{snip} 
Arpaio has aired about $2.8 million of his own TV ads, according to a media-tracking source, and has leaned on his national name recognition to raise millions more for his campaign, while Penzone's campaign has been less well-funded. But several polls this fall have shown Penzone leading Arpaio in his second attempt to unseat the sheriff.

Studies Examine Racial Bias in Pollution, Devaluation of Black Communities Brian Flood, UIC, November 3, 2016 
Present-day racial biases may contribute to the pollution and devaluation of lower- and middle-class black communities, according to new research led by a social psychologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
The investigation was based on several studies demonstrating that physical spaces, such as houses or neighborhoods, are targets of racial stereotyping, discrimination, and implicit racial bias. 
The researchers found study participants applied negative stereotypes, such as 'impoverished,' 'crime-ridden,' or 'dirty,' in their perceptions of physical spaces associated with black Americans. 
'These space-focused stereotypes can make people feel less connected to a space, assume it has low-quality characteristics, monetarily devalue it, and dampen its protection from environmental harms,' said Courtney Bonam, UIC assistant professor of psychology and the study's lead author. 
'Some of the findings show that space-focused stereotypes figuratively pollute the way observers imagine a target area and their judgment about an existing structure in it, while other work demonstrates how this presumed figurative pollution leads observers to consider literally polluting black space.' 
{snip} 
One study asked a national sample of over 400 white U.S. citizens to read a proposal to build a potentially hazardous chemical plant near a residential neighborhood. Half of the participants were told the nearby neighborhood is mostly black, while the other half was told that the area is mostly white. 
Even though all participants read the same proposal, they were less likely to report opposition to building the chemical plant when the nearby neighborhood was mostly black. 
'They assumed it was an industrial area when it was black, which led them to devalue and subsequently pollute the land there,' Bonam said. 'Additionally, these findings held when participants were told that the neighborhood had middle-class property values; and when accounting both for participants' perceptions of the neighborhood's class level, and their negative attitudes toward black people in general.' 
In another study, a national sample of more than 200 white U.S. citizens were given pictures of the same middle-class, suburban house. Half of the people were told the house was in a predominately black neighborhood, while the other segment was informed that it was in a mostly white neighborhood. 
Those who thought the house was in a black neighborhood estimated its value at $20,000 less than the other group, and were less likely to say they would live in or buy the house.

Toni Airaksinen, College Fix, November 4, 2016 
{snip} 
The Rutgers University student who hosted anti-feminist provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos for his first U.S. college event says the student newspaper fired him Monday because of his conservative views. 
Aviv Khavich published his final column for The Daily Targum Sunday night, arguing that immigration enforcement is not 'anti-immigrant.' 
He spoke as an immigrant himself, born in Israel after his Ashkenazi Jewish parents fled Belarus in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse. 
But the trigger for the firing may have been Khavich's demand that his column include the phrase 'illegal aliens' to describe those in the country illegally. 
It was the final straw for the Daily's editor, who said Khavich repeatedly fought over 'stylistic' editing changes to his columns over the past several months. 
{snip} 
But two of his last three [columns] were about immigration. Khavich opposes accepting Syrian refugees into America as a security threat, and his final column Sunday said flatly: 'Justice is mass deportation. Justice is respecting my [legal immigrant] family and millions of others like us.' 
Khavich told The College Fix in a phone interview that 'every instance of 'illegal alien' I wrote was changed to 'undocumented immigrant'' by his editors. 'But I considered it a part of my opinion to not use' the latter term, which he finds 'politically correct and also inaccurate.' 
When Khavich complained to his editor about the edited draft, she said the 'illegal' edit came from the top: Editor in Chief Dan Corey wanted the column to follow Associated Press Style. 
The AP Stylebook was revised three years ago to disapprove of using 'illegal' to describe a person, as opposed to an action, after having affirmed 'illegal immigrant' just a year earlier . 
But AP Style also frowns upon 'undocumented''“the term used in Khavich's published column'“because the term is 'not precise.' Khavich notes that federal law uses the term 'alien.' 
His editor was 'not happy' after being confronted, Khavich said, and he was fired the next day. 
{snip} 
'At the slightest questioning of their 'unbiased editing,' they jump at the excuse to rid themselves of someone who has been challenging their narrative,' he wrote in The Tab. 
'I was writing articles that very strongly challenged narratives,' he told The Fix. 'I am sure that it was a termination was based on political bias.'

Obsessing over Europe's Refugee Crisis While Ignoring Africa's Is White Privilege at Work Mehdi Hasan, Washington Post, November 3, 2016 
Have you not heard? Europe is in the throes of a refugee crisis. Hosting asylum-seekers from Syria is a 'historic test of Europe,' says Germany's Angela Merkel. 'The most responsibility [for refugees] is and will continue to be placed on Europe,' adds European Council President Donald Tusk. 
For President Obama, 'uncontrolled migration into Europe' is a 'major national security issue' for the United States. Even the Dalai Lama agrees that there are 'too many' refugees inside the European Union. 
Really? 'Too many'? 'Historic'? Consider these facts: More than 65 million people were forced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) , including 21.3 million people classified as refugees living outside the borders of their own countries. 
Admittedly, a record 1.3 million refugees sought asylum within the European Union last year, with thousands more applying for asylum every month. Yet what of Sub-Saharan Africa, home to 4.4 million refugees and a whopping 19.5 million 'people of concern' to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees? 
We don't often hear about these particular refugees or asylum-seekers, do we? They are, to borrow a term from British historian Mark Curtis, 'unpeople,' the poor, nonwhite residents of the developing world who tend to be ignored by the Western media. 
Where is the rolling coverage of Kenya's Dadaab camp, for example? Dadaab is the largest refugee camp in the world, but in a move that could displace as many as 300,000 people , Kenyan authorities are in the process of closing it down. It puts the recent British media frenzy over the so-called 'Jungle' camp in Calais, France, with its 10,000 migrants, into some perspective, doesn't it? 
{snip} 
Yet Europe's refugee crisis continues to suck up all the oxygen of global publicity. The UNHCR fundraises for a whole host of 'special situations' involving refugees. As of the end of October, the ' Central African Republic situation ' was 17 percent funded; the ' Somalia situation ' 21 percent funded and the ' South Sudan situation ' 25 percent funded. The ' crisis in Europe ,' however? Fifty-six percent funded. 
The double standard is as brazen as it is shameful. Remember: The European Union accounts for 17 percent of global GDP ; Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for a little more than 3 percent . 
{snip} 
This is not just navel-gazing hyperbole but white privilege, plain and simple. How else to describe a collective tendency to obsess over a refugee crisis in (rich, white) Europe, rather than in (poor, black) Africa? In what warped world are thousands of penniless and homeless refugees considered to constitute a crisis only when they wash up on the shores of western Europe?

Harvard Cancels Men's Soccer Season After Finding Sexually Explicit 'Reports' Continued Through 2016 Andrew M. Duehren et al., Harvard Crimson, November 3, 2016 
Harvard has cancelled the men's soccer team's season after an Office of General Counsel review found that the team continued to produce vulgar and explicit documents rating women on their perceived sexual appeal and physical appearance. 
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise wrote in an email to Harvard student athletes that he decided to cancel the rest of the team's season because the 'practice appears to be more widespread across the team and has continued beyond 2012, including in 2016.' 
'As a direct result of what Harvard Athletics has learned, we have decided to cancel the remainder of the 2016 men's soccer season,' Scalise wrote. 'The team will forfeit its remaining games and will decline any opportunity to achieve an Ivy League championship or to participate in the NCAA Tournament this year.' 
Last week, The Crimson reported that the 2012 men's soccer team created a 'scouting report' of that year's women's soccer recruits, rating them numerically and assigning each a hypothetical sexual position. University President Drew G. Faust instructed OGC, Harvard's team of lawyers, to 'review' the matter. 
{snip} 
'The decision to cancel a season is serious and consequential, and reflects Harvard's view that both the team's behavior and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable, have no place at Harvard, and run counter to the mutual respect that is a core value of our community,' Faust wrote in a statement. 
Faust wrote she 'was deeply distressed to learn that the appalling actions of the 2012 men's soccer team were not isolated to one year or the actions of a few individuals.' 
{snip} 
Last week, when Scalise first saw the documents'”which were, until recently, publicly accessible through the 2012 team's Google Group'”he said he would immediately reach out to coaches of both men's and women's teams to discuss the report, but added that any response should be internal to Harvard and 'not a media thing.' 
{snip} 
Men's soccer coach Pieter S. Lehrer wrote in a statement that the team is 'beyond disappointed that our season has ended in this way, but we respect the decision made by our administration.'

Loading Posted on November 4, 2016 Putin Condemns Europe's Handling of Migrants and Says the Child Rape in Austria Shows 'a Dilution of National Values' Jennifer Newton, Daily Mail, November 3, 2016 
Vladimir Putin has waded into the migrant crisis condemning Europe's handling of asylum seekers and saying a case of child rape in Austria 'dilutes national values'. 
The Russian president has largely kept quiet over the refugee crisis in Europe but has now spoken out of his disbelief over its handling claiming that a continent that 'can't protect its children' has no future. 
His comments come off the back of a case in Austria last week, which saw an Iraqi migrant have his conviction of raping a 10-year-old boy at a swimming pool in Vienna overturned. 
He was originally convicted of the crime but it was overturned because a court didn't prove he realised the boy was saying no. 
It came after the migrant, identified as 20-year-old Amir A., claimed that it was a 'sexual emergency' because he had not had sex for four months. 
A second trial for the rape is expected to take place next year, but the attacker is likely to remain in custody until then. 
And speaking at a press conference this week, Putin slammed Europe's migration policy and cited the case, where the victim was from a Serbian family living in Austria. 
He said: 'In a European country, a child is raped by a migrant, and the court releases him. 
'It doesn't fit into my head what on earth they're thinking over there. 
'I can't even explain the rationale'“is it a sense of guilt before the migrants? What's going on? It's not clear.' 
He also claimed that the case highlighted 'the dissolution of traditional national values' adding: 'A society that cannot defend its children has no future.' 
And Putin's words appeared to have struck a chord, as he is extremely popular with Serbs. 
In the rape case, the boy had arrived in Austria with his Serbian mother, who paid for him to go to the Theresienbad swimming pool, where he was violently attacked. 
The boy was so badly injured that he needed hospital treatment but he will be forced to go back to court for the Iraqi man's second trial, outraging the Austrian Serbian community. 
Austrian media say the case has hardened the communities position against asylum seekers, who were previously divided about whether to vote for the left-leaning Green party candidate or the far right option Nobert Hofer in upcoming elections. 
However, it is not the first time Russia has lashed out at the EU's handling of the migrant crisis. 
In March, Konstantin Romodanovsky, head of Russia's Federal Migration Service accused leaders of willfully ignoring cultural differences that have caused such widespread friction and chaos across the Continent. 
He also added that 'multiculturalism has failed' because Europe never formed a unified strategy to integrate refugees into Western society. 
He said: 'The European Commission left it up to individual nations to decide how they want to treat asylum seekers'“despite the fact the policies and capabilities of member states are very different. 
Romodanovsky also accused EU countries of ignoring the 'differences in culture, religious traditions, and customs' with the refugees, the vast majority of whom are Islamic.

When the River Ran Red Arthur Kemp, American Renaissance, September 2008 
The year is 1838. Dodging a flurry of spears, the Boer commander, Andries Pretorius, rides forward to seize a Zulu warrior. In the midst of an epic battle between more than 15,000 warriors and just 468 Boers, Pretorius has decided to take a Zulu alive. He wants to send the captive back to his king, Dingaan, to convey surrender terms to the Zulu nation. 
The warrior has no intention of being taken alive, and jabs viciously at Pretorius with his assegai. This is a Zulu spear, normally a long-shafted throwing weapon, but the warrior broke its shank earlier for close-quarter stabbing. Pretorius gives up on capturing the Zulu, and tries to shoot him. 
With a single-shot, muzzle-loading musket, he has only one chance of a hit. There is no time to reload in close combat. To his horror, Pretorius sees the smoke-trailing ball whiz past the Zulu's ear. At the same time, the Zulu lunges forward, causing Pretorius's horse to stumble backwards, throwing the white commander to the ground. 
Leaping to his feet, he meets the attacking Zulu, who knows he is now on equal terms with the white man, who can no longer use his magic shooting stick and carries no weapon comparable to the assegai. Pretorius is now fighting for his life. He just manages to sidestep the spear point, striking it away with the butt of his gun. 
Spinning round, the Zulu raises his spear high above his head and thrusts down, as he has been trained to do in the Zulus' disciplined army. It is a blow that will be fatal if it strikes home, but Pretorius sees it coming. He grabs the spear point with his left hand to ward it away from his chest. The sharp point cuts deeply into his palm, embedding itself at an angle that makes it impossible for the Zulu to pull it out. Pretorius seizes the Zulu by the throat with his free right hand and throws him to the ground in an attempt to strangle him. 
The Zulu struggles, and with the help of two good hands is about to break free, when one of Pretorius's men comes upon the scene. He pulls the assegai out of the commander's hand, and plunges it into the Zulu's side, ending the struggle. 
Pretorius remounts and heads back to the Boer camp for treatment. He is not worried, as he knows by now that this greatest of all battles between Boers and Zulus has already been won. The main Zulu army has been broken in two, and the river that runs along one side of the Boer camp is stained red with Zulu blood. The place and the tributary known previously as the Ncome will be renamed Blood River. Pretorius knows that the Zulu defeat, which will include some 3,000 killed on the battlefield, is a fit revenge for the deception and murder committed by the Zulus 10 months earlier. 
Prelude to War 
The great clash between the Boer and Zulu nations was not, as leftist historians like to claim, the result of ruthless white colonialism suppressing an indigenous people. It came about because the Zulus rejected an extremely reasonable attempt at negotiation by the Boers. 
The Boers, pioneers of Dutch, French, and German descent, were the people who opened up much of what was later to become South Africa. Their first antecedents had landed on the southernmost tip of Africa in 1652, only 45 years after the Virginia Company settled on Jamestown Island. 
When they arrived in the area now known as Cape Town, whites came into contact only with Hottentots and Bushmen. As the number of Europeans increased, they expanded east and north, only meeting their first black tribe, the Xhosa, some 500 miles away, on South Africa's east coast. The Xhosas were migrating south, fleeing the warlike Zulu to the north, who were engaged in imperialist expansion of their own. 
For just under a century white settlement halted at this eastern frontier border formed by the coast and firm Xhosa settlement. It was not, however, a time of peace, as Xhosa were constantly raiding the Boers who lived on the border. This caused much harm and discontent among the farmers, who blamed the Dutch-ruled colonial government back in Cape Town for the lawlessness. 
It only added to the border farmers' grievances when the British took the Cape Colony from the Dutch in 1806 to prevent the colony from falling into French hands during the Napoleonic Wars. It was vital to control the merchant and naval refitting station on the way to the Far East. The new colonial masters not only started anglicizing the colony, when they abolished slavery they offered compensation that amounted to hardly a quarter of a slave's value. 
Exasperated by incessant Xhosa attacks and British attempts to suppress their language and culture, groups of frontier farmers, filled with a sense of manifest destiny not seen again until the opening of the American West, set forth to the north and the east in a movement known as the Great Trek. The trekkers (they became known as Voortrekkers, or pioneers, only after 1880) bypassed the Xhosa in search of new, unsettled territory, in which they could establish independent Boer nations. All told, it was only a small minority of no more than 12,000 Boers who made the trek to the future Natal, Orange Free State, and Transvaal regions. They traveled in several waves of covered, ox-drawn wagons much like the Conestogas in which Americans opened the West. 
The Boer leader of the time, Piet Retief, had written the trekker 'manifesto,' in which he spelled out the farmers' long-held grievances against the British. By1836, the Boer wagons had crossed the great mountain range into Natal, in an act of audacity that few thought possible. The range, the highest in southern Africa, had been named the Drakensberg'”the Dragon Mountains'”because they were said to be impassable. 
Retief had identified a large piece of uninhabited land to the north of the Zulu kingdom, which lay open to settlement. Retief knew that if he wanted the land for his people, he could take it unopposed. However, he wanted to live in peace with his Zulu neighbors, and before taking possession, he opened negotiations with the Zulu king, Dingaan. He wanted no misunderstanding between the two peoples. 
He sent a letter to the Zulu king explaining why he wanted to speak to him, and first visited Dingaan's capital'”a large circle of reed and grass huts'”on November 5, 1837. Retief left the main body of trekkers and went to the Zulu king's capital, Umgungundhlovo ('the place of the elephant'), to negotiate a treaty that would allow Boers peacefully to settle land adjoining the Zulu kingdom. Dingaan said he would let the Boers live in Natal if they recovered cattle stolen by a Tlokwa chieftain. Retief and his men did so, and Dingaan agreed to give the land to the Boers. 
Retief returned to Umgungundhlovo on February 3, 1838, to finalize the agreement. He arrived with 60 volunteers, including his own son and three children of other men'”it was common for children to accompany their fathers on expeditions of this kind. The next day, Retief and Dingaan formally signed a treaty'”the Zulu king made his mark by scratching an 'X' on the document'”giving possession of the land to the Boers. Delighted, the Boers sent scouts back to the main encampments to report the successful outcome and made ready to leave. As Retief and his party were about to saddle up, a messenger arrived from Dingaan inviting the Boer party to a special celebration to mark the signing. Retief was suspicious but did not want to offend Dingaan. As they had on previous visits, the Boers stacked their firearms neatly outside the reed walls and entered the royal enclosure unarmed. 
As they ate and drank, a Zulu impi, or warrior unit, put on a dance for the guests. According to the account of a white missionary who was present, the dancing warriors drew ever closer to the Boers, till they were just in front of the seated whites. When the Zulu king leaped to his feet and shouted, 'Kill the white wizards!' the impi fell upon the surprised Boers. Some of them drew their hunting knives and tried to fight off the attackers, but they were quickly overwhelmed. 
The Zulu warriors bound the whites with reed ropes and dragged them to Hlomo Amabutho, the Hill of Execution, near the Zulu capital. There they clubbed the Boers to death, one by one, with Retief kept until last and forced to watch his son being murdered. After Retief's heart was extracted and presented to Dingaan as proof that the Boer leader was dead, the bodies were left for the vultures, in accordance with Zulu custom. 
Dingaan then gave orders for the full might of his army to attack the Boer camps. The settlers had received the message Retief had sent earlier and believed everything had gone well. They were therefore completely unprepared and badly undermanned. The 60 men in Retief's party were all dead. Many other men had gone hunting, leaving only a light guard for the women and children. The Boers were so confident there would be peace that they had not even posted sentries. Just before dawn, barking dogs aroused the outlying wagons. Then, thousands of Zulu warriors attacked the several hundred trekkers '” women, children, and old men '” as they lay sleeping. 
The Boer historian, Gustav Preller, who interviewed survivors, left a harrowing account of the aftermath: 'All around dozens and dozens of bodies '¦ babies who had had their heads smashed open against the wagon wheels, women, dishonored and in some Zulu custom, their breasts cut off '¦ [I]n a wagon, blood filled to a height of several inches, the life blood of an entire family ebbed out where they lay '¦ Jan Bezuidenhout, one of the few young men who had not gone ahead with the Retief party, grabbed his four-month-old baby daughter out of her crib and ran off through the undergrowth '¦ [H]aving lost his pursuers a few miles away, Bezuidenhout checked for the first time on his daughter in his arms. She was dead; a single spear stroke had killed her.' 
The slaughter became known as the Weenen, the Dutch word for weeping, and a town of that name still stands near the site. Of the 600 Boers camped in the area, Zulus killed some 300, including 185 children. The rest survived because grazing requirements for their animals meant that the Boer camps had to be widely dispersed. If Dingaan's men had scouted more thoroughly, found all the encampments, and attacked them simultaneously, the slaughter would have been far greater. 
Pretorius arrives 
The Boers now faced their greatest challenge. Their camps were full of wounded men, orphaned children, and widows. The Zulus had stolen an estimated 25,000 head of cattle and sheep during the Weenen slaughter, and ammunition was running low. The Zulu armies might return at any time, and they were a formidable force, as the Boers discovered when they launched a raid to avenge the massacre. On April 6, 1838, 347 trekkers under a divided command of Piet Uys and Hendrik Potgieter rode into Zulu territory only to be defeated by some 7,000 warriors not far from Umgungundhlovo in what became known as the Battle of Italeni. 
This new disaster forced the Boers to face reality: They had to either abandon their quest for independence and return to the Cape Colony, or find some means to fight their way through. The widows and orphans argued strongly for pushing on. They knew that if they fell back to the Cape they would have to live on charity, whereas if Dingaan could be defeated they could at least recover their livestock. Many Boers were also convinced that God favored them, and that setbacks were only a test of faith. 
It was at this moment of indecision that a popular lawyer named Andries Pretorius answered the trekker call for reinforcements, and rode into camp with 60 men and a brass cannon. The Boers appointed him commander in chief on November 25, and he immediately began preparing a strike against the Zulu. 
His means were few. A force of only about 468 Boers, including three Scotsmen, set out on November 27 seeking battle. For extra protection, the Boer column of 64 wagons traveled four abreast, instead of the usual single file. Each night, they formed a circular defensive formation, known as a laager. 
Pretorius realized that even with two front-loading cannon, his force was too weak to defeat the Zulu army in an open field. He therefore decided to draw the enemy into an attack on the Boer encampment. Each day patrols and scouting parties rode ahead, sometimes led by Pretorius himself, to make sure no unexpected surprises were waiting over the horizon. 
On December 9, 1838, the Boer party reached the Zandspruit tributary of the Waschbank River. It was here that the Boer chaplain, Sarel Cilliers, first pledged during his nightly sermon that if God helped them defeat the Zulus, they and their descendents would celebrate that day in honor of God, and that they would build a church in commemoration. The Boers repeated this oath, known in Afrikaner folklore as 'the covenant,' every night until they met the enemy. 
There appeared to be no movement from the Zulu side. On December 12, Pretorius decided to move camp to the Buffalo River, hoping to provoke the Zulus by moving farther into their territory. That day, he sent out two patrols, one under the command of his deputy, Commandant Hans De Lange, and another, under the Scotsman Edward Parker. This latter group saw action when they came upon a small group of Zulus. They killed the warriors and took the women prisoner. 
Pretorius drew up a message for Dingaan on a white cloth, explaining that he was leading a commando to punish the Zulus. If, however, Dingaan was willing to cooperate, Pretorius wrote, he was still willing to make peace'”a generous offer in light of the earlier betrayal. He freed the prisoners and told them to give the message to Dingaan. He received no answer. 
On December 13, the Boers spotted Zulus and what appeared to be a large number of cattle near their camp. Piet Uys had been tricked by such a ploy at the Battle of Italeni. Zulu warriors, crouching behind toughened animal-skin shields, looked like cattle from a distance, and Uys dropped his guard. He was killed in a surprise attack by the 'cattle.' 
Pretorius did not make the same mistake, and he sent a 120-strong mounted unit to investigate the 'cattle.' They turned out to be Zulus, and in the short fight that followed the Boers killed eight warriors but suffered no casualties. Pretorius now suspected that the Zulus were preparing for battle. 
On December 15 he moved the Boer camp to a position alongside the Ncome River, itself a tributary of the Buffalo River. A scouting expedition that day confirmed the presence of two huge Zulu armies a short distance away. 
Pretorius prepared for battle. His men drew the wagons into a D-shaped formation, one side overlooking a large hippopotamus path facing the Ncome River, another side facing a soil erosion ditch, and the third side facing the open plain. Pretorius chose the site to limit the directions from which the Zulus could attack. 
The laager was large enough to contain all the horses and oxen. The defenders tied the wagons together with leather ropes, and closed off all openings between and below the wagons with a Pretorius innovation, so-called fighting gates, which were slatted wood fixtures through which defenders could fire. They left two small openings, sealed with removable fighting gates, so cavalry could leave the laager. Finally, they attached lanterns to the ends of large ox-whips planted upright in the ground. These dangled in front of the laager and were to serve as forward lighting during the dark hours when Zulu usually attacked. Zulus captured after the battle said they had believed the lights waving in the breeze above the Boer camp were spirits, and that fear of the spirits kept them from attacking that night. 
Battle is joined 
In Pretorius's own account of the battle, he wrote that as the mist cleared on the morning of December 16, he saw that the Boer camp was completely encircled by tens of thousands of Zulu warriors, even where the terrain would have made an attack difficult. Estimates placed the number of Zulus at between 15,000 and 25,000, although no official count was possible. Whatever the figure, Pretorius wrote that it was a 'terrible sight.' 
The Boers had been ready and armed since two hours before daybreak. The two cannon were in position, and the fighting gates closed. The defenders expected to run out of ammunition for the cannon, and had stacked up suitably sized stones at strategic points along the perimeter to fire as a last resort. The Boers would fire stones that day. 
The front lines of the Zulu force were still, squatting, only about 40 paces from the wagons, waiting for the signal to attack. Pretorius decided to strike first. At his signal, three bursts of fire from the Boer guns and two blasts from the cannon broke the silence. The Boers' orders were to then hold their fire. As the billows of gunpowder smoke lifted, they saw that the surviving Zulus had fled some 500 paces from their former front line, leaving behind dozens of dying and dead comrades. 
The Boers then heard the noise of the Zulus breaking their spear shafts to make them into short, stabbing weapons. A frontal assault was coming. A few minutes later, the Zulu force stormed the wagons, screaming wildly, shields held high, and assegais in readiness. Withering gunfire ripped through the Zulu ranks, and while some managed to reach the wagons, they were gunned down before they could cut through the wagon canvasses. 
Another group of Zulus tried to attack from inside the erosion ditch by standing on each others' shoulders and scrambling over the edge. Pretorius ordered Cilliers, the fighting churchman, to see off the attack. He led a group of men out of the relative safety of the wagon perimeter, and they proceeded to kill some 400 Zulus. One Boer, Philip Fourie, was wounded when an assegai struck him in the side. 
The Boers then wheeled one of their cannon out of the laager, pointed it into the ditch, and fired a shot that literally blew apart the assaulting party. The survivors fled the ditch in disarray. This sparked a temporary retreat by the Zulu, and marked the end of the second unsuccessful attempt to break the Boer lines. The wounded Boer, Fourie, returned to the wagon circle for treatment. 
As the Zulus waited for new orders, Pretorius ordered another burst of cannon fire into their ranks, provoking a spontaneous charge against the wagons. Although it was the longest single assault of the nine-hour battle, it was utterly defeated, as the Boers cut down wave after wave of attackers. Gun barrels got so hot men had to hold them with wet cloths for reloading. 
As the third attack fell back, the Boers launched their first surprise counterattack, as the mobile fighting gates swung open and a cavalry unit charged the Zulu lines. Shooting from the saddle, the Boers tried to turn the Zulu lines to their left. Desperate Zulu resistance, which saw hundreds more of their number killed, stopped the encircling action, and the Boer horsemen rode back to the wagons. They regrouped and launched a second attempt, driving the Zulus further away. A third mounted charge finally broke through the Zulu lines. The Boer cavalry then turned and attacked the Zulus from the rear. Pinned between the cavalry and cannon fire from within the wagon circle, the main Zulu force facing the open plain scattered. 
A reserve Zulu force tried to cross the Ncome River to attack the laager but so many warriors were gunned down that their blood stained the water red. Pretorius himself then led another cavalry charge from within the laager. Cut to pieces, with thousands dead, the Zulu army, which had courageously charged repeatedly against a better-armed enemy, finally broke ranks and fled. 
Pretorius divided his cavalry into two units and sent them in pursuit. Mounted Boers killed hundreds of warriors during a three-hour chase. It was during this pursuit that Pretorius was wounded. Two other Boers, including Fourie, suffered nonfatal assegai wounds, but these were the only Boer casualties. An estimated 3,000 Zulus died on the battlefield, and many more died later from wounds. 
The Aftermath 
Early the next morning, Pretorius ordered the camp broken, and marched the commando straight to the Zulu king's capital. He was confident the Zulus no longer posed any significant threat, but he hardly expected the sight that awaited him on December 20 at Umgungundhlovo. Dingaan had fled with his wives and cattle, leaving the circular camp of reed huts burning, as a symbol of the destruction of Zulu power. 
On the outskirts of the capital the Boers found the skeletons of Retief and his men. 'Their hands and feet were still bound fast with thongs of ox hide,' wrote Cilliers, 'and in nearly all the corpses a spike as thick as an arm had been forced into the anus so that the point of the spike was in the chest.' Retief, who was identified by the remains of a satin vest he had worn, still had a leather bag draped over his shoulder bone. In it was the treaty, signed by Dingaan, giving the Boers the unoccupied land to the north. According to one of the Boers who saw it, the treaty was astonishingly well preserved'”as if it had been 'left in a closed box.' Pretorius's men buried Retief and his party on Christmas Day 1838. 
Dingaan fled north but was captured by a rival tribe, the Swazis. Earlier, he had persecuted the Swazis, and they murdered him in revenge. The new Zulu king, Mpande, was officially installed in 1840, and confirmed the contents of the treaty with the Boers, who established their first republic in southern Africa. Also in 1840, in fulfillment of their covenant, the Boers built a church to mark the Blood River victory. 
The Battle of Blood River entered the Afrikaner psyche as a divinely-inspired victory, and December 16 became a public holiday in South Africa, celebrated each year with festivals, church services, and reenactments. The battle represented the victory of European civilization over the darkness of Africa, of Christianity over heathens. It helped justify white supremacy and the self-appointed right of Afrikaners to rule over, not apart from, the black tribes. 
Yet the Battle of Blood River, in many ways, symbolized all that was wrong with the white settlement of southern Africa, and why that experiment failed. The Boers are to be praised for wanting to settle unoccupied land peacefully, and for seeking the friendship of neighboring peoples, but neither they nor their descendents understood that demography is the arbiter of nations. Those who form the majority population of a territory will rule that territory, no matter how powerful a ruling elite may be. They will determine its culture and society. A majority-European population will create a society that reflects European values and norms. A majority-African population will create a society that reflects African norms. 
The Boers never understood this. Even at the Battle of Blood River they had at least 60 black servants and an indeterminate number of mixed-race servants, who helped load weapons. Parker, one of the Scotsman, had more than 100 black servants. 
To the present day, the overwhelming majority of Afrikaners have black servants who work on farms, in factories, and in homes. Afrikaners failed to understand that by giving the native population the benefits of European civilization, blacks would grow in numbers and overwhelm their society. The Cape Colony and the original Boer republics, which were largely uninhabited by natives when they were settled by Europeans, are today home to tens of millions of Africans. 
The Church of the Vow, built by the Boers in 1840, still stands in the town of Pietermaritzburg, named after Piet Retief. But Pietermaritzburg, supposedly the symbol of the Boer victory over the Zulus, is today part of a municipality called Umgungundhlovo, named after Dingaan's capital. It is also the capital of the South African province of Kwa-Zulu Natal, and its population is more than 95 percent black. 
The Church of the Vow stands alone, graffiti-scarred and abandoned, in a dirty downtown slum. Its decay illustrates the fatal error made by the victors of the Battle of Blood River, that of ignoring the demographics of race. If whites had taken possession of those unoccupied lands and kept them for themselves alone the history of South Africa would have been entirely different. 
If the Boers had inhabited and worked their own land rather than rely on black labor, the states they created might still be strong and independent today. Their decision to use non-white labor was a critical error that undid all of the sacrifices of the early pioneers. 
The only way to maintain a civilization is for the majority to occupy its own land with its own people, and to do its own manual labor. This law governs the rise and fall of civilizations, and the victors of Blood River ignored it, to their cost.

Posted on November 6, 2016 How Hillary Courts the Black Vote Ethnomasochism reaches a new low. 
The Democratic presidential primary was one of unprecedented pandering for the non-white vote. As The Guardian summed up one of the debates: 'Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders made a conspicuous play for Latino and African American voters.' Mrs. Clinton won the 'conspicuous play' hands down, and with it, the nomination. The failure of Senator Sanders to win the necessary quotient of non-white votes was repeatedly pointed out by the chattering class up until the time he dropped out. 
In February one black commenter pointedly wrote that Sen. Sanders, 'has many miles to go to convince black voters that he can fight for our interests.' By May, black commenter Steven Thrasher wrote a piece titled, ' Bernie Sanders isn't winning minority votes '“ and it's his own fault .' Mr. Thrasher identified Sen. Sanders's problem as 'failing to talk about racism at every turn.' 
This accusation may seem ludicrous, since Sen. Sanders surrendered his stage to Black Lives Matter activists several times. But in comparison to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Thrasher was right about Sen. Sanders. No mainstream candidate in the history of the United States has more thoroughly debased himself in the quest for the black vote than Mrs. Clinton. Since this helped her win the Democratic nomination, she has continued the strategy. In the few days remaining before November 8th, let's take a look at Hillary Clinton's most ethnomasochistic moments. 
1) In January of 2016, Mrs. Clinton was at something called the Iowa Brown and Black Forum (with none other than Jorge Ramos ), where she was asked 'Can you tell us what the term 'white privilege' means to you? And can you give me an example from your life or career when you think you have benefitted from it?' This is how she began her answer: 
Where do I start? I think it is hard when you are swimming in the ocean to know exactly what is happening around you so much as it is when you're standing on the shore perhaps watching . . . . I was born white, middle-class, in the middle of America. . . . 
2) Early in the Democratic nomination, Mrs. Clinton's campaign released a memo aimed at stifling the rising momentum of Bernie Sanders: 
[W]hereas the electorates in Iowa and New Hampshire are largely rural/suburban and predominantly white, the March [primary] states better reflect the true diversity of the Democratic Party and the nation . . . . It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for a Democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among African American and Hispanic voters. We believe that's how it should be. emphasis added 
3) Shortly before the South Carolina primary, at Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, Mrs. Clinton explained how to break down barriers for African Americans: 
Ending systemic racism requires contributions from all of us'”especially those of us who haven't experienced it ourselves. White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers that you face every day. 
We need to recognize our privilege and practice humility, rather than assume that our experiences are everyone's experiences. All of us need to bring our skills to bear'”and especially young people coming up today, who have a passion for social justice and are helping to create new ways to solve intractable problems. 
4) In April of 2016, while on a back radio show, Mrs. Clinton was asked what she always carries in her bag. She immediately answered, 'hot sauce.' When one of the black hosts noted that she would be accused of pandering to black people for giving that answer, she asked hopeully, 'Is it working?' 
5) Just a few weeks after a Black Lives Matter supporter murdered five police officers , the Democratic National Convention that convened to nominate Mrs. Clinton passed a resolution, no doubt with her approval, supporting Black Lives Matter : 
[T]he DNC joins with Americans across the country in affirming 'Black lives matter' and the 'say her name' efforts to make visible the pain of our fellow and sister Americans as they condemn extrajudicial killings of unarmed African American men, women and children. 
White politicians have tried to win elections through public displays of ethnomasochism for decades, but this election has set a new low. And if Mrs. Clinton loses, her pandering could live on in another form. As the Black Lives Matter activist Tef Poe explained , if Mr. Trump wins, 'young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go . . . ain't no more rules. We've been too nice as is.'

Why Obama Will Win Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, August 2008 
It is time to get used to the idea that the next president of the United States will be black. Why will a nation we are so often assured is 'racist' elect a black president? And will it make a difference? 
Ever since Hillary Clinton dropped out of the race, the polls have reported consistently that Barack Obama will beat John McCain. The media love to tell us that whites say they support the black candidate and then vote for the white, but there is no reason for whites to lie in this campaign. Mr. Obama will not get a majority of the white vote but he will get enough to beat Mr. McCain. Why will so many whites vote for Mr. Obama? 
First, some support his policies. They want to end the war in Iraq, and they want the standard liberal program of socialized medicine, higher taxes, more handouts, and more government. There has always been a substantial minority of whites who vote this way, and they have a clear favorite in Mr. Obama. 
Second, as many people have pointed out, an enormous number of whites think it is deeply virtuous to vote for a black'”not for an out-and-out race man such as Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton, but for an unthreatening, well-scrubbed black who speaks standard English and promises to 'bring us together.' Even if they live sharply segregated lives, whites thrill to the language of 'coming together,' and they adore blacks who don't act or sound black. 
For many whites, voting for Mr. Obama will be an act of high patriotism. Electing him will prove America is not 'racist,' and many whites believe that rising above 'racism' is America's sacred calling. One must never underestimate the importance to whites of feeling virtuous. Most would rather lose a leg than be thought a 'bigot,' and a vote for Obama is a painless way to burnish anti-racist credentials. 
Third, young whites will line up for Mr. Obama. They have been swallowing anti-white, multi-culti propaganda all their lives and have not knocked around enough to discover it is false. Some who know their parents will vote for Mr. McCain will make a special point of voting for Mr. Obama. Every new generation thinks it is cooler, hipper, and wiser than any generation that ever lived, and what could be cooler, hipper, or wiser than putting a black man in the White House? For many young whites, a vote for Mr. Obama will be a denial of every uncool, unhip, and especially every even faintly race-realist thing their parents ever said or did. 
Fourth, although the country seems to have a collective memory of no more than two weeks, Americans think everything is 'historic.' Whenever someone breaks an obscure record in professional baseball we are told history was made. If you ask someone why he waited in line all night to buy the first Apple iPhone he will tell you it's a 'historic' product. Americans love anything that is 'historic,' and for people who think a few more stolen bases are 'history' right up there with the Battle of Lepanto, putting a black man in the White House will be the discovery of America, Pearl Harbor, and the Second Coming all rolled into one. Many whites will vote for Mr. Obama because they want to think they helped 'make history.' 
The media, which has its own grim reasons for supporting Mr. Obama, is mesmerized by the same prospect. Editors salivate at the thought of writing headlines like 'History is Made' the day after the election, and some will lose all self-control and add an exclamation mark. The emphasis, of course, will be on Mr. Obama as the first black president, implying more to come. The media, which always subtly boost the Democrat, will be even more blatantly partisan this time, downplaying every blunder Mr. Obama makes and highlighting Mr. McCain's. 
Fifth, many whites will vote for Mr. Obama'”or at least not vote for Mr. McCain'”because the Republicans have nominated the most stunningly unattractive candidate in years. Old and pock-marked, Mr. McCain is thoroughly disliked in the Senate for arrogance that he cannot even hide from voters when he is not speaking from notes. He has dismayed Republicans by promoting amnesty for illegals, and dismayed everyone else by saying America should stay in Iraq for 100 years if it takes that long to 'win.' Mr. Obama therefore has the enormous advantage of running against an opponent that not even Republicans like. 
Mr. Obama will also crush Mr. McCain in face-to-face debates. Mr. McCain cannot put an unscripted sentence together any better than George W. Bush can, and will come across as a thick-witted geezer. Mr. Obama, who is as glib as any politician, gives credence to H.L. Mencken's definition of democracy as 'rule by orators.' 
But what about America's storied 'racism'? Isn't America brimming with people who can't bear the thought of a black president? Americans have been numbed for decades by attractive television-blacks who read the news, forecast the weather, and tell us which brand of toothpaste to buy. Americans get a steady diet of heroic movie-blacks who outsmart and beat up white brutes, solve baffling technical problems, dispense sage advice, and save the world. Even the current Miss USA is black. There are millions of whites who do not want to live with blacks or have much to do with them, but would a black president be much different from nearly eight years of black secretaries of state? The march of blackness may be vaguely worrying to whites but they think there is nothing they can do about it and that they shouldn't even if they could. 
The final reason why whites will vote for Mr. Obama is that the Republicans do not have the backbone to attack him in the only way that would work. If they were serious, they would fill the airways with Jeremiah Wright prancing and raving, along with the message: 'This is the man who married Mr. and Mrs. Obama, baptized their children, and whom Mr. Obama calls a 'family member'.' They would buy radio ads quoting Michelle Obama's thesis in which she says she will always be black first and American second. Mr. McCain has nothing like the stomach for a campaign like this. 
Many blacks probably think he has the stomach for considerably worse: 57 percent think Mr. Obama is in greater physical danger than any white politician, and many say they would have warned him not to run, for fear he would be killed. An assassination would certainly be a shattering event. There is no telling how many cities would go up in flames, and Third-World countries, which have followed the Obama nomination with unprecedented interest, would help make it the most widely reported killing in history. (I have just returned from a Muslim country in which everyone has heard of Mr. Obama and likes him, but most have never heard of John McCain.) Whatever gruesome fantasies blacks may be spinning, however, assassination has gone out of style in America, and white resistance'”such as it is'”is dependably nonviolent. Mr. Obama will be perfectly safe. 
In any case, Mr. Obama will win far more white votes than he will lose because he is black. Whites who don't want a black president would not vote for a Democrat anyway. As for black voters, even nominal Republicans are said to be running for the doors, but strictly racial voting has always been fine for blacks. Not so for whites, of course. Just try telling your co-workers that you disagree with Mr. McCain but are voting for him because he is white. 
Racially conscious whites will be in a quandary in November. Even if Mr. McCain's policies are worse than Mr. Obama's should they vote for the white man'”one with an adopted Bangladeshi daughter and who long ago betrayed white interests? Even after years of being softened up with black heroes and figureheads, a black in the White House is a powerful symbol of white dispossession. A mulatto president is an almost explicit endorsement of miscegenation. This is bitter medicine. 
Some whites have argued that a black president would undercut the charges of 'racism' whites are forever facing, but they are dreaming. The entire government could look like a meeting of the Mystic Knights of the Sea, but as long as blacks are worse off than whites we will be blamed for it. Sensible whites cannot cheerfully vote for either man; I suspect most will stay home or vote for a minor candidate. 
Aside from the symbolic impact, which cannot be calculated, will President Obama be much different from a President Hillary Clinton? She would lard her cabinet with blacks and Hispanics, nominate ultra-liberal judges, push for amnesty, grovel before non-whites everywhere, and load up the 'civil rights' division of the Justice Department with anti-white sharks. She would certainly make a bigger fool of herself over Hispanics and Asians (see ' Turning Up the Pressure ,' AR, May 2008). Our choice, therefore, could not be more disagreeable. On balance, we get to decide which is the more degrading spectacle: deluded white people giving their country away or clear-eyed blacks helping themselves to it. 
President Obama will, however, face special pressures. He can't let the pushier brothers walk all over him, but he will have to throw them enough bones to keep them off his back. It will be a tricky balance. Mr. Obama's first annual address to the NAACP will be a love feast, but every year after that it will be harder to explain why black unemployment, poverty, and incarceration rates haven't changed at all. 
Even Mr. Obama's star-struck white supporters will eventually wonder what happened to all that 'change' he promised. There is not going to be change. The system is far too stuck in its self-serving ways for that. With the help of an enlarged Democratic majority in Congress, Mr. Obama may set up some wheezing, byzantine form of socialized medicine, but no one will be happy with it. If Mr. Obama inherits a sick economy, a weak dollar, expensive oil, and shrinking revenues, Americans will not at all like the change they get. 
On the bright side, with Mr. Obama we have a good chance of piquant First-Lady behavior. What will the White House be like with Michelle in charge? Will she want a new exterior paint job? How and whom will she entertain? Will the Big Man's guest bedrooms'”in the African tradition'”be turned over to third cousins from Kenya and the South Side of Chicago? There is no telling with what improprieties large and small Mrs. Obama will entertain us as she makes up her mind whether she is an American. 
It will be an edifying presidency; and whites may be a little less deluded in 2012.

Last Majority White Election, Minorities to Give Democrats White House Through 2060 Paul Bedard, Washington Examiner, November 6, 2016 
This may be the last year that a Republican will be elected president, as the growth of liberal-leaning minorities all but guarantees that Democrats will hold the majority at least for the next four decades. 
That's according to an unusual survey on the impact of minorities, mostly Latin American, done for WalletHub and provided to Secrets . 
The study used two models based on population projections and matched to the overwhelming 65 percent minority turnout for President Obama in 2012 and the underwhelming 50 percent response for George W. Bush in 2004. 
The bottom line: In no presidential election from 2020-60 do the Republicans win. {snip}

Tim Kaine Cheers End of White Majority in Spanish Address Julia Hahn, Breitbart, November 5, 2016 
During an Arizona speech delivered in Spanish, Sen. Tim Kaine cheered the demographic transformation of the United States caused by the nation's federal immigration policies, telling his Latino audience on Thursday, 'You are the future of America.' 
'By 2050, communities of color will represent the majority of our population,' Kaine said. 'So, of course, Latinos will help shape the future of America because you are the future of America.' 
As the Pew Research Center has documented, this demographic transformation is largely the result of the changes to visa issuance policies enacted into law in 1965 that lifted the immigration controls put in place by Calvin Coolidge during the 1920s. {snip} 
{snip} 
Yet during his remarks, Kaine laid out how a Clinton administration plans to hasten the demographic transformation through expansive immigration policies that would essentially bring about the dissolution of national borders . Kaine explained how a Clinton-Kaine administration would 'end family detention,' 'close private detention facilities,' freeze deportations, and would give citizenship'“and, by extension, voting privileges and access to federal benefits'“to the illegal population. 
Kaine also doubled down on his pledge to expand President Obama's executive amnesty: 
A few months ago, the Supreme Court put DAPA on hold. That was devastating for millions of families. But it's important to note that the Court didn't actually rule on the substance of the case. Hillary and I have always said that DAPA is squarely within the President's authority, and we will keep fighting for it.

Donald Trump: Minnesota Has 'Suffered Enough' Accepting Refugees Tessa Berenson, TIME, November 6, 2016 
In a pitch to suspend the nation's Syrian refugee program , Donald Trump said Minnesotans have 'suffered enough' from accepting Somali immigrants into their state. 
'Here in Minnesota you have seen firsthand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state, without your knowledge, without your support or approval,' Trump said at a Minneapolis rally Sunday afternoon. 
He said his administration would suspend the Syrian refugee program and not resettle refugees anywhere in the United States without support from the communities, while Hillary Clinton's 'plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities.'

Little-Loved by Scholars, Trump Also Gets Little of Their Cash Peter Olsen-Phillips, Chronicle of Higher Education, November 7, 2016 
It's no secret that campaign contributions from higher education have favored Democratic candidates for years. When it comes to the current presidential race, however, data show that the gap between left and right has grown from a rift into a chasm. 
A Chronicle analysis of Federal Election Commission data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics shows Donald Trump raising a tiny fraction of the campaign money that the previous two Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain, drew from higher-education professionals over comparable time periods. 
Across higher education, donations in congressional and Senate races showed a ratio of Democratic to Republican giving similar to that of the two previous presidential-campaign cycles. But support for Mr. Trump stood at less than 8 percent of what Senator McCain raised from higher-ed professionals, and around 4 percent of the donations that Mr. Romney pulled in over the same time period, once the figures were adjusted for inflation. 
As of June 30, faculty members and others who work in higher education had donated $76,668 to Mr. Trump's campaign committee and to support 'super PACs''“independent committees that can raise and spend unlimited funds. By comparison, people working in academe had given $6.4 million to Hillary Clinton. Those figures account for donations of at least $200 that the Center for Responsive Politics has determined come from people associated with higher education. They are the most-recent figures available.

California Set to Let Public Schools Teach Primarily in Spanish Blake Neff, Daily Caller, November 6, 2016 
California isn't even close to a swing state in the 2016 presidential election, but that doesn't mean nothing is at stake for voters in the nation's largest state. 
After Tuesday's vote, hundreds of thousands of California schoolchildren may start attending classes primarily en espaÃ±ol, thanks to a voter referendum that would repeal the requirement that schools teach primarily in English. 
California's Proposition 58 would repeal Proposition 227 , a measure that easily passed nearly two decades ago, in 1998. Proposition 227 required all public schools in the state teach 'overwhelmingly' in English, with limited-English proficiency (LEP) students transitioning to fully English classes as quickly as possible. 
{snip} 
Across the state, the English proficiency of LEP students tripled in just a few years , and math scores rose as well. 
But now, with California's immigrant population higher than ever, the state is poised to reverse course. 
Polls indicate the Proposition 58 is likely to pass. Ironically, supporters of the measure place an emphasis on English rather than foreign tongues. They argue that the bill will allow for 'dual immersion' programs, where both native English and native Spanish speakers can learn in a bilingual environment. In the long run, they argue, this will increase multilingualism and provide the state with a competitive advantage.

Why American Surrogates Are in Demand for Chinese Families Kalee Thompson, Hollywood Reporter, November 4, 2016 
The first time Dianna Barindelli carried a baby that wasn't her own was in 2012. 'We were done having kids, but I still wanted to be pregnant,' says the Modesto, Calif., stay-at-home mom, whose own daughters are 6 and 9. Barindelli signed up with the Center for Surrogate Parenting in Encino, one of the most exclusive surrogacy agencies in the world. In 2014, she matched with a Chinese couple. Unlike many agencies, CSP first shows parent applications to the surrogates, rather than the other way around. 'It's little things that you'll connect with people over,' says Barindelli, who was attracted to pictures of the couple's extended travels and their traditional wedding photos. 
The embryo transfer took place in late 2014. Barindelli emailed the mom weekly, sending updates and ultrasound pictures with WeChat, an app that offers instantaneous translation. The intended parents (IPs) planned to be there for the birth, but the baby boy arrived two weeks early, 24 hours before they arrived. Says Barindelli: 'I texted and made sure [the mom] was OK with him staying in my room. I cleared everything with her. I didn't want her to feel bad that she wasn't there.' 
Barindelli, who used her surrogacy fees to set up a college fund for her girls, is pregnant again, this time with the baby, due Feb. 1, of a Taiwanese couple. She may not be done: Her first Chinese couple emailed her recently, soon after their son's first birthday. They still have frozen embryos and hope that Barindelli, now 40, will carry their second child. 
Commercial surrogacy is banned in most parts of the world, as well as in many U.S. states. Until recently, infertile couples, singles and gay would-be dads had a handful of options to turn to when it came to finding a surrogate, among them India, Thailand, Nepal and Mexico, where surrogacy services have cost a quarter of the $100,000 to $200,000 bill typical in the U.S. But in the past few years, those countries have started enforcing laws banning international surrogacy. Meanwhile, China'“the world's most populous country, with a growing wealthy elite and where some doctors believe infertility is more common than in the U.S.'“lifted its decades-long one-child policy. The result is a soaring Chinese demand for U.S. surrogacy services, one that is flourishing particularly in California, with its culturally friendly enclaves, excellent physicians and favorable state laws that regard IPs as a baby's legal parents even before birth, if proper court documents are filed. {snip} 
{snip} Despite CSP's Southern California location, 51 percent of its clients now are foreigners, up from 15 percent a decade ago. Rival agency Growing Generations (clients have included Sarah Jessica Parker and 30 Rock director Todd Holland) also sees half of its clients coming from overseas, as does Gifted Journeys, a boutique agency in Pasadena. At San Diego's Expect Miracles Surrogacy, international clients account for 80 percent of IPs. And of foreigners participating in this permutation of California's birth tourism, the number of Chinese IPs is growing the fastest, making up the most common single foreign nationality for many agencies right now. 
{snip} 
Most local agencies have a mix of Caucasian, Latina and African-American surrogates. 'I can't think of a time when we've had an Asian surrogate,' says Growing Generations' Bergman. Multiple agency heads say Chinese IPs tend to strongly prefer a Caucasian surrogate. 'People really have this fantasy because of a lot of the marketing that was done in China,' says Gifted Journey's Wilson-Miller. 'They have this picture of blond surrogates who look like movie stars carrying the baby with their traditional families.' {snip} 
The concept of cross-race surrogacy can confound friends, family and associates of surrogates and IPs alike. In August, comedian GloZell Green, who is African-American, and her husband, also African-American, had a baby girl via a surrogate. 'Our surrogate is a blue-eyed blonde,' the YouTube star told potential IPs gathered in a Culver City hotel in early October. People in her life 'kept asking if the baby was going to be white.' 
Surrogate selection aside, California has the added allure of numerous enclaves where families can be surrounded by Chinese speakers and businesses. 'People from China can stay in Irvine, for example, and they have Chinese TV on their cable packages. Throughout California there are places they can go and shop and find stuff in Chinese. If they go to Kansas or Oklahoma? It's total culture shock,' says Expect Miracles' Anderson. {snip} 
Of course, any baby born via surrogate in the U.S. has birthright citizenship. 'The Chinese couples really like that because a lot of them want to come back and forth,' says Molly O'Brien, a fertility lawyer with offices in Torrance who frequently travels to China to participate in information sessions for would-be parents, often sponsored by doctors offices or assisted-reproduction agencies. 'Maybe they eventually want that child to be able to go to college here.' Unlike the U.S., China forbids dual citizenship, and most American-born Chinese babies remain U.S. citizens. 'Most Chinese couples just keep that American passport. It's only if you want to use the government services that you've got to be Chinese,' says CSP's Synesiou.

Protesters Clash After Mount Greenwood Police-Involved Shooting Laura Podesta and Will Jones, ABC 7 (Chicago), November 7, 2016 
Protesters clashed Sunday afternoon near the site of a deadly police shooting of a 25-year-old man in Chicago's Mount Greenwood neighborhood. 
Investigators said Joshua Beal, of Indianapolis, was armed when a confrontation between him and officers resulted in him being fatally shot. However, family members dispute the police narrative. 
Michael Beal, Joshua Beal's brother, was charged with aggravated battery to a police officer, resisting arrest and attempting to disarm a police officer, a Cook County State's Attorney spokesperson said Monday. He is scheduled to appear in court at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday. 
On Sunday, Mount Greenwood residents squared off against activists demonstrating against the shooting. The clash between Black Lives Matters and Blue Lives Matters groups became tense at times as they exchanged chants such as 'KKK' on one side and 'CPD' on the other side.

According to police, the shooting occurred after a vehicle leaving funeral services at a nearby cemetery stopped in traffic in front of a Chicago fire house near West 111th Street and South Troy Street. An off-duty firefighter told the driver that they were illegally blocking the fire lane. The occupants exited the vehicle and a verbal/physical altercation ensured, police said. An off-duty Chicago police officer was inside a nearby business and assisted the firefighter. 
A Chicago police sergeant driving to work stopped when he observed a man with a firearm in his hands. After the man 'failed to drop his weapon, shots were fired striking the individual multiple times,' police said.

According to family, an off-duty officer in an unmarked vehicle cut off one of the vehicles in the funeral procession. The family members and officer got out of their vehicles. After a verbal exchange, gunfire erupted but Beal's family said that he did not provoke the officer, and merely disclosing that he had a concealed weapon permit.

Video circulated online on Sunday that claimed to show Beal holding a gun. 
'The problem is everybody is making their assumptions based on the little stuff they see, the picture, the video. No one knows what happened,' activist Ja'Mal Green said. 
The video appears to capture the tense moments before the shooting, showing at least two people with their guns out. In another video, gunshots can be heard.

According to the criminal complaint, Harris ordered a woman at knife-point into an abandoned building in September. 
The victim, who is not being identified since she is a victim of sexual assault, told police she knew Harris from seeing him in the neighborhood before but she never knew his name and didn't have a relationship with him.

German Ministry Wants Migrants Returned to Africa: Report Reuters, November 6, 2016 
The German Interior Ministry wants to stop migrants ever reaching Europe's Mediterranean coast by picking them up at sea and returning them to Africa, the Welt am Sonntag newspaper reported on Sunday. 
In what would be a huge shift for a country with one of the most generous asylum policies, the ministry says the European Union should adopt an Australian-style system under which migrants intercepted at sea are sent for processing at camps in third countries. 
'The elimination of the prospect of reaching the European coast could convince migrants to avoid embarking on the life-threatening and costly journey in the first place,' the paper quoted a ministry spokeswoman as saying. 
'The goal must be to remove the basis for people-smuggling organizations and to save migrants from the life-threatening journey.' 
The ministry's proposal calls for migrants picked up in the Mediterranean'“most of whom set off from conflict-torn Libya'“to be sent to Tunisia, Egypt or other north African states to apply for asylum from there. 
If their asylum applications are accepted, the migrants could then be transported safely to Europe.
