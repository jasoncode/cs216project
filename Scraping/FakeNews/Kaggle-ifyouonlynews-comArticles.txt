October 26, 2016 Trump Has Hissy Fit After Reporter Points Out Pausing Campaign To Open Hotel Is Really Dumb (VIDEO)   
Don't bother pointing out how incredibly dim-witted it is to pause a losing campaign just days away from Election Day to open up a luxury hotel to the Republican nominee, Trump doesn't want to hear it. 
After inexplicably spending a day participating in an opening ceremony for a new Trump Hotel in Washington DC, its namesake was in no mood to discuss his failing campaign. CNN's Dana Bash learned that the hard way when she asked the question on everyone's mind: What were you thinking? 
Rather than answer, Trump threw a hissy fit. 
'I say the following: You have been covering me for the last â€” long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I've been doing this for weeks straight,' Trump said. 
'For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you'll ask me that question. I think that's a very rude question, to be honest with you.' Dana Bash: Is your DC hotel opening free advertising? Donald Trump: 'No, not at all' https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/9HHqooom8r 
â€” CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 26, 2016 
For those keeping score that short answer checks a lot of boxes: Whining about the media Flagrant conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton's health Groundless accusation that asking a simple question is 'rude' No answer whatsoever 
Trump may be testy due to his slow realization that his campaign is under water, he has no practical way forward, and it would take a miracle to win. 
Instead of even trying, he seems to be retreating to the things he knows will make him money after the election. His campaign recently launched the prototype to 'Trump TV,' a daily live stream filled with confused campaign staffers, shameless opportunists and Rudy Giuliani. He also seems desperate to salvage his failing properties, something that may not be possible after running a campaign that offended practically every group in America. 
Already there are signs that Trump's hotels have taken a hit. Yahoo explains : Rates for rooms at Trump's new D.C. hotel are being slashed as travelers weigh their options, and smartphone data suggest fewer people are visiting his properties compared to rival venues nearby. The Republican nominee for president is in danger of losing not just the election, but something dear to a man who claims the marketing value of his name alone is worth $3 billion: the many customers, mostly wealthy, who have stayed at his hotels, played a round at his golf courses or held galas at his oceanside resorts. 
Trump may find that his bigotry has cost him not only the election, but the fortune he valued more than his reputation as well.

For those of us too ensnared in the Trumpster fire to pay attention to anything substantive, a majorly screwed up thing was happening to our fighting men and women. The LA Times broke the story that the Department of Defense has been ordering almost 10,000 one-time National Guardsmen from California to pay back enlistment bonuses due to an error over a decade ago. Horror stories began pouring in of soldiers being notified that they MUST pay back the money or face wage garnishments, tax liens and interest charges. 
This, of course, prompted the Obama administration to take immediate action while our do-nothing Republican Congress focuses on such important issues as defunding Obamacare. 
Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced today that the Pentagon will suspend efforts to recoup bonuses overpaid to troops more than a decade ago. 'There is no more important responsibility for the Department of Defense than keeping faith with our people. That means treating them fairly and equitably, honoring their service and sacrifice, and keeping our word,' Carter added. 
Of course, Republicans love to wear the biggest flag pins they can find and feign love for the troops come reelection time, but really put their words into action. This might explain why they did NOTHING to stop this. 
It seems the California National Guard told the state's members of Congress two years ago that the Pentagon was making every effort at taking back its promised re-enlistment bonuses from thousands of soldiers. In fact, the California National Guard went so far as to develop a plan to assuage the problem. However, being the greedy do-nothing leaches that they are, the Republican-led Congress didn't lift a finger. 
Once again, the Obama Administration is forced to step in and help the very people Republicans claim to love so much.

Republican Mark Kirk's political career imploded tonight live on a debate stage in Illinois. RIP Mark Kirk's political career. Thoughts and prayers. 
In what may be the biggest foot in mouth moment of any political campaign since Todd 'Legitimate Rape' Akin's self-immolation, Kirk, who is running for U.S. Senate against the very popular Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D) to represent Illinois, decided to use the senate debate stage to go completely and profoundly racist. 
It started when Duckworth told voters about her families long military tradition, one that dates back all the way to the Revolutionary War. Her point was a good one. Her family has sacrificed for the country for generations and far too many politicians flippantly go to war without thinking about who they will put in harms way. 
'My family has served this nation in uniform going back to the revolution. I am a daughter of the American Revolution. I've bled for this nation. But I still want to be there in the Senate when the drums of war sound because people are quick to sound the drums of war and I want to be there to say this is what it costs and this is what you're asking us to do. And if that's the case, I'll go. It's families like mine that bleed first. But let's make sure that the American people understand what we are engaging in and let's hold our allies accountable because we can't do it all.' 
Kirk interjected by saying a line that will haunt him for the rest of his very short career. 
'I had forgotten your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.' 
A problem: Duckworth's family did fight in the Revolutionary War. Kirk assumed because she was of mixed heritage that they couldn't have. Mark Kirk is not a smart man. She's an active DAR member. And Sen. @MarkKirk â€“who lied about his own military recordâ€“is questioning her family's military service. 
â€” Brandon Friedman (@BFriedmanDC) October 28, 2016 
The stunned silence both from the moderator and from Sen. Duckworth kind of say it all. 
So long, Mark Kirk. Have a good retirement!

Two stunningly depressing things happened in America on Thursday evening that demonstrate just how differently the country treats its citizens based on race â€“ and they happened more or less at the same time. 
In North Dakota, police driving armored vehicles (yes, like tanks) and armed with rifles, sound cannons, and shotguns loaded with 'nonlethal' beanbags marched in formation to shut down peaceful protesters opposing an oil pipeline. A few states over in Oregon, a jury found that the violent militia group which led an armed occupation of a federal wildlife reserve was innocent of all charges and free to go . America is two countries with two different sets of rules, and Thursday evening highlighted that fact in stunning detail. 
On Twitter, user @theshrillest put the juxtaposition in all its glory in a single screengrab. His twitter feed was a mixture of stories about the violent suppression of a peaceful protest led by a Native American tribe directly affected by the environmental impact of the oil pipeline and news of the release of the Bundy militia â€“ a group of out-of-state rabblerousers who believe the federal government should be disbanded. 
â€” ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (@theshrillest) October 27, 2016 
This is the second time the Bundy family threatened to kill federal agents and expressed a desire to lead a revolution only to see zero charges stick to them. The group will now get to return to Nevada, just in time for an election in which many conservatives are openly stating that they plan on taking up arms if Trump loses. On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. 
On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. 
You in? 
â€” Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
In short, it's a scary time to be a democracy. An Oregon jury just gave every white male in the country a not-so-subtle nod that violence against the government will be met with a look the other way when it comes time to a trial.

By Wes Williams Election 2016 , Politics , Videos October 27, 2016 Young Turks Finds Out Why Trump Is About To Lose Utah For Republicans For First Time In Decades (VIDEO) Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
Utah. It is one of, if not the most conservative states in the nation, largely thanks to the Church of Jesus Christ Of Latter Day Saints, aka the Mormons. And as such it is usually a solid, bright red state on the electoral maps. Utah has gone for the Democratic presidential candidate exactly once in the past 64 years â€” in the anti-Goldwater wave of 1964. But this year it is possible that Utah will not be in the Republican column when the votes are added up. That is, at least not in the Republican column headed by Donald Trump, who is largely being rejected by voters in the Beehive State. 
Many Utah voters with strong religious beliefs are not happy with Trump, and unlike many Christian evangelical leaders who have decided to stay hitched to his wagon despite the allegations of improper sexual conduct, Utahans are bolting, putting the state in play. The Young Turks sent Michael Shure to the state to find out what was on people's minds, and what many of them had to tell him was quite clear â€” they don't think Trump is a good representative of their Christian beliefs. 
None of the young Utahans Shure spoke to said they planned to vote for Trump. Some said they would vote for Gary Johnson. One college student indicated that he would consider a vote for Hillary. But the name that seemed to come up more than any others was Evan McMullin. 
McMullin is the Republican who is running an independent campaign for president. He is also a Mormon, which gives him a huge advantage in Utah. Some recent polls of the state have McMullin polling even with Clinton, but still trailing Trump. But as Benjamin Morris notes at FiveThirtyEight, there are questions about the methodology of those polls that could mean McMullin's support in Utah is even greater than he is getting credit for. 
Whether McMullin wins in Utah or whether Trump is able to squeak out a razor thin victory, one thing is certain: unlike many of their traditional 'Christian' counterparts in the deep south and the rest of the Rocky Mountain region, many Mormons want no part of Trump or his policies, which some of them were quite willing to tell Shure that they considered to be un-Christian. Not only will a loss of Utah further hurt Trump's slim chances of winning the White House, a McMullin win there would make him a footnote in future history books as the first third-party candidate since George Wallace in 1968 to win electoral votes. 
Here's Michael Shure's report on the mood in Utah, via YouTube:

It's been a weird 24 hours if you happen to live inside the head of Sean Hannity. The Fox News pundit and Trump propagandist has been live tweeting some sort of mental breakdown and it's entirely unclear what the endgame is. 
It started like this: For reasons unknown, on his radio show Hannity told listeners that he would be asking Donald Trump for help in shipping the Obama family â€“ all of whom are Americans â€“ to Kenya after the election. 
If you're saying to yourself 'Wow, that sounds pretty racist' the answer is yes, yes it is . There is no universe in which a person telling America's first black president to go back to Africa cannot be construed as a racist statement. That is, unless you happen to reside in the fantasy world that Sean Hannity currently lives in. 
After getting rightfully hammered for the comments, Hannity either got very drunk or had a psychotic break and tweeted out a profoundlymisspelled defense of what he said. The tweets wouldn't pass a breathalyzer. 
Tweet #1 (now deleted): 
Liberal media. It's was Josh Ernest who refuse to amswee teh ? Will Obama stay in the US if DT wins. I mentioned I'd pay a charter to â€¦ 
'amswee teh ?' Really? 
Tweet #2 (now deleted): 
Liberal media 2 Any country they choose. 1- Canada where the satire piece was written Kenya where he visited 
The second tweet also linked to the website of infamous conservative provocateur Chuck Johnson, a racist white nationalist who once proposed the theory that Obama was a gay prostitute. Johnson is so morally repugnant that he was officially permanently banned from ever holding an account on Twitter. 
After waking up, Hannity got back on Twitter to do damage control. According to him, these incoherent cries for help weren't what they looked like, he just didn't have his glasses onâ€¦ Half asleep and didn't put my glasses on. Lol. I wish I had a better excuse. https://t.co/GUvw7ef2AV 
â€” Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 27, 2016 
He also doubled down on his defense of telling Obama to go to Africa. I said I'll send him anywhere he wants to go. I mentioned Canada first, Kenya where part of his family is today, Jakarta where he once lived https://t.co/wvNxCMTXYu 
â€” Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 27, 2016 
None of which 'answee teh ?' of why the Obama family should be exiled to another country in the first place. Glasses or not, that's a level of fascist thinking that has been relatively unthinkable in American democracy. Only since the rise of Trump, and his avowed policy of going after his political and personal enemies after he's elected, would the idea of banning a former president from the country even be imagined. Now it's being normalized by a Fox News pundit with an audience of millions. 
Sean Hannity has been a hack for many years, but Donald Trump finally completely severed his grip on reality. We're witnessing what happens when a man with major delusions gets to indulge them in front of an audience of millions each night on a major network â€“ and it isn't pretty.

Add another group to the list of people who won't be voting for Donald Trump. Oh, a few of them might but after they see this ad for Trump, I'm betting the majority will laugh and vote for Hillary Clinton. 
Earlier in the month, Trump attended a Bollywood concert for charity. It was organized by the Republican Hindu Coalition, a group that was founded by a rich Indian-American named Shalli Kumar, who is looking to be the Hindu Sheldon Adelson. The Indian community is heavily Democratic so good luck with that. 
Trump came to the event, lit the Diya â€” it's doubtful that he had any idea what it was â€” and then spoke. He pandered told the attendees that 'the Indian and Hindu community will have a true friend in the White House,' promising they will 'defeat radical Islamic terrorism.' 
This inspired Kumar to make an ad which will be playing 20 times a day on Indian-American channels. He refused to say how much it cost the campaign to buy that much time but we can guess that Mr. Kumar is helping foot the bill. He previously has given almost $1 million to a fundraising committee which benefited both Trump and the RNC. 
There is a lot to laugh about in the ad, bt Trump's inability to pronounce Hindi words takes teh cake. It is such an obvious bit of pandering, even for him. 
The ad starts with a wish for a Happy Diwali , a holiday I am certain Trump is ignorant of. The cut to Trump's orange face is a bit jarring after the pretty lights and flowers. 
Kumar wanted to draw a similarity between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The PM's campaign had used a clever catchphrase which loosely translates to 'This time a Modi government.' Kumar wanted Trump to replace Modi's name with his own. In Hindi, that is 'Ab ki baar Trump sarkar.' Don't get ahead of me, now. 
In the ad, which uses footage of Trumps speech at the charity concert, a 2008 photo of the hotel which was attacked by Islamic militants in Mumbai gives way to a picture of PM Modi. Then back to Trump who tries to speak the short Hindi phrase. It's something one must see to believe. 
Make sure you aren't drinking anything as you may endanger your computer. 
'Approved by Donald Trump?' Well, I guess so. This ad is not just pandering, it is awful. I hope the Indian American community laugh this off and then go vote against this man who only shows interest in their culture when it might get him votes. 
Oh, and Happy Diwali! May the light burn away any bad times and welcome the good.

Donald Trump has been claiming for weeks that the election is going to be 'rigged' to prevent him from winning. He has made repeated calls to his supporters to go to the polls and keep an eye on what is going on. Even though a number of GOP candidates and officeholders have rejected Trump's claim that there will be massive voter fraud, in some places the Republican Party is holding training classes for poll watchers. 
In-person voter fraud, which is what the GOP has claimed for several years is costing their candidates elections, has been repeatedly proven to be so rare as to almost not exist. But that doesn't stop people like Trump from raising the alarm about it. And what he has been saying is having an effect. 
According to The Washington Times, Arizona Republican officials say that in 2012 their poll watcher training sessions attracted maybe 50 or 60 people. This year, thanks to Trump's Chicken Little-type warning, that number has increased to over 1,000. 
In Virginia, which has moved from red to purple to relatively blue in recent years, poll watcher trainees at a class in Fairfax County, just outside Washington D.C., expressed their belief that Trump is correct , according to The Wall Street Journal. 
Penny Hendrix, a 52-year-old stay at home mom, said this: 
'Very clearly there is going to be massive voter fraud, and it will definitely be to ensure Hillary Clinton wins. I've been concerned about this for some time, and Trump bringing it up is raising awareness.' 
Except that he is raising awareness of a problem that isn't really a problem at all. Even the extremely right-wing Heritage Foundation, which produced a list of voter fraud convictions , could only put together about 300 examples. Now, 300 cases of voter fraud in one national election where millions of ballots are cast is a very small amount. But the Heritage list covers multiple years and multiple elections, making the impact even smaller than miniscule. The GOP has truly become an organization of Don Quixotes who are preparing to tilt at imaginary illegal voters. 
The leader of the Virginia poll watcher training, Republican activist Reagan George, told the attendees that they can't challenge someone just because it looks like that person is going to be voting for Democrats. But he followed that statement by regaling his audience with stories of Democrats taking pictures of their votes so they can be rewarded by union officials or other GOP bogeymen. He also told them of how Democrats in some areas of the country have been getting the severely disabled to vote, even those who don't really understand what is going on. And has George seen things like that happen with his own eyes? Of course not! But he has heard stories. And to a conservative, any story you hear from another conservative about some alleged misdeed carries much weight than actual facts and evidence. 
There's not going to be massive voter fraud in this election, just as there has never been massive voter fraud before. Even in what was perhaps the most contentious election in recent U.S. history, the one in 2000, the issues with voting affected the outcome, in only one state â€” Florida. And as we all well know, those problems were caused not by voter fraud, but by poor election mechanics. What Trump and his GOP allies are attempting is to create bedlam on election day, and maybe in the process manage to win by intimidating hundreds or even thousands of legal voters in key states.

With the recent news that Affordable Healthcare rates are predicted to rise in 2017, you'd expect that any even partially informed Republican presidential candidate would jump on that news and spin it into oblivion. 
Not Trump, though. Nope. He was too busy plugging his new Florida resort to care. 
Seth Meyers spent Wednesday's Late Night segment, A Closer Look , focusing on the abysmal way the Trump campaign is being managed and how it, as Seth put it, 'never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity.' 
While some of the segment was aimed at Trump spokesperson Newt Gingrich and his total meltdown on The Kelly File , Seth spent the better part of his time ripping Trump and his complete lack of knowledge about Obamacare to shreds. 
After showing video of Trump at his new Florida resort this week saying that all of his 'employees are having a tremendous problem with Obamacare,' Seth had this question: 
'What are you talking about?! Obamacare is for people who don't have health insurance, but your employees do get health insurance through you!!' 
We'll see if Trump answers. 
Meanwhile, further proving his point, Meyers shows a clip of Trump's resort manager clarifying to the media that 99 percent of their employees are indeed insured through the company and not Obamacare.

By Jameson Parker Feminist Issues , News October 26, 2016 Congressman Who Said He Couldn't Look His Daughter In The Eye And Endorse Trump Is Voting Trump 9143 Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
Thumb through the pages of the dictionary until you find the word 'craven' and a picture of Republican congressman Jason Chaffetz's picture will probably greet you. In a year full of pathetic spinelessness from Republicans, his efforts seem to stand out. 
It's hard to imagine a congressman doing more damage to his lasting reputation than Chaffetz pulled off on October 26th, 2016 â€“ a date that will live in infamy. First, news broke that Chaffetz was already prepping for a Clinton White House by pre-planning two years worth of senseless investigations in a shameless attempt to destroy any chance of her â€“ or congress â€“ accomplishing anything. And yet sadly that story was only half of the reason why Chaffetz singlehandedly proved Mark Twain wasn't kidding when he quipped 'Suppose you were an idiot and suppose you were a member of Congress, but then I repeat myself.' Congressman Chaffetz is a very big idiot. 
A little over one week after Chaffetz tried to score some cheap political points by unendorsing Donald Trump following the release of an audio tape in which the Republican nominee bragged about sexual assault, he sent out a tweet clarifying that when he said he wouldn't endorse or defend Trump, he never said he wouldn't vote for him. I will not defend or endorse @realDonaldTrump , but I am voting for him. HRC is that bad. HRC is bad for the USA. 
â€” Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 27, 2016 
What's the distinction between 'endorsing' and 'voting for' you ask? Well, for Jason Chaffetz it's like when you want to bake a cake but you also want to eat it too. See? Simple. Chaffetz is a very, very big idiot. 
Making Chaffetz's cowardice all the more apparent is the reason why he said he was unendorsing Trump in the first place. Like the rest of the country, he heard Trump's boasts about grabbing women's genitals and found it abhorrent. He also said he couldn't face his 15-year-old daughter and support a potential sexual predator like Trump. 
'I can no longer in good conscience endorse this person for president. It is some of the most abhorrent and offensive comments that you can possibly imagine. My wife and I, we have a 15-year-old daughter, and if I can't look her in the eye and tell her these things, I can't endorse this person.' 
So to be perfectly clear, Jason Chaffetz, Republican congressman from Utah, can't look his daughter in the eye and endorse Donald Trump, but he can stare her straight in the face and say 'Dad just voted for this monster.' 
Nice work, Jason. You pathetic, small man. I'm forwarding your congressional photo to Webster's.

Hey, we've all been there. You make a judgment call at work, it blows up in your face and you go home humiliated and stewing. Only in James Comey's case, you're the director of the FBI, and you may have just wrongfully influenced the presidential election with a single baffling mistake. 'Whoops' doesn't cover it. 
Comey set off a firestorm of controversy with the release of an open letter to Congress, letting them know that the FBI would be 'reopening' the case into Hillary Clinton's emails, despite clearing her of any wrongdoing several months ago. Republicans handled the news with something approaching orgasmic ecstasy. Finally , they thought, Hillary Clinton is going down and Trump's double digit polling deficit can be erased . 
Trump himself seemed to believe this letter was the key to victory. Less than an hour after it was spread around the internet, Trump was boldly claiming it to be 'bigger than Watergate'â€“ a statement as ludicrous as it was premature. 
Within two hours, the entire new story fell apart. The emails were not sent by Hillary Clinton. They were not stored on her private server. They appeared to contain no incriminating information. Despite the lack of any story, the media ran with it. Republican hacks like Speaker of the House Paul Ryan were breathlessly demanding Clinton lose her right to classified briefings. Trump's campaign manager was taking a victory lap. Conservatives were saying this proved Clinton was a crook. 
All of it was nonsense. And nobody seemed to realize how crazy this reaction was than Comey himself, who reportedly sent a second letter that day, this time to his staff, basically saying 'I fucked up. I'm so sorry.' FBI Dir. Comey sent a second letter today â€“ to FBI employees. He seems to have some doubts about what he did (via WashPost) pic.twitter.com/IagFJRZYyU 
â€” West Wing Reports (@WestWingReport) October 29, 2016 
Comey seemed to understand what many critics had been saying all day: This email announcement was misleading and pointless, and gave Republicans a ton of free ammunition in their disingenuous fight against Hillary Clinton. It's unclear just how much it would affect the election, but the very fact that it could affect the election was a serious issue. The FBI, as a rule, is not supposed to use their department to sway voters. Comey, whether intentionally or not, was doing just that. 
The fact that Comey had these misgivings and still sent his first letter raises serious questions about his judgment. As a lifelong Republican (albeit one who has distinguished himself as a man of strong integrity with respect on both sides of the aisle), one has to wonder if he would have been so flippant in publishing a letter that would wrongfully damage the campaign of a Republican candidate. 
Ironically, it is the question raised around Comey which seem more pressing for the national interest than a few new emails found on a computer not used by Hillary Clinton. Let's hope we get some answers.

By Joe Clark Videos October 28, 2016 Trump Calls Black Man At Rally A 'Thug,' Kicks Him Out â€“ Except There's One BIG Problem (VIDEO)   
On Wednesday night during a rally in Kinston, North Carolina, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump once again focused on his fabled 'minority outreach' initiative by kicking another black man out from his 'inclusive' rally. 
Trump accused the man of being a protester, however, like most of his supporters, Trump's perception of a person of color was way off base. 
During the exchange, Trump points to an older black man in a red shirt who made his way about 30 feet from the stage while yelling out 'Donald!' to get the nominee's attention. Trump immediately pounces on the opportunity to show how tough he is to his rabid supporters. 
'We have a protester!' he said . Trump then said this to Cary: 'By the way, were you paid $1,500 to be a thug?' 
As the man was escorted out by Trump's security team, the crowd erupted into chants of 'Trump! Trump! Trump,' as the candidate bellowed 'You can get him out. Get him out.' 
C.J. Cary is a 63-year old former Marine who has been a Trump supporter ever since the billionaire replied to a 1992 letter Cary sent during Trump's first divorce. 
Cary made his way to the rally on Wednesday to see his hero and deliver a personal message via note to the GOP candidate. The note contained a bit of advice for the nominee, basically telling him to stop saying offensive things about women, minorities, and people with disabilities on the campaign trail, otherwise 'lying Hillary' will beat him in November. 
However, the former Marine never had an opportunity to make it more than 30 feet from his favorite candidate before being stopped and unceremoniously thrown out of the venue by the candidate himself. 
Cary said he tried to explain his intentions to the security personnel. 
'I said, 'I was trying to get this doc to Mr. Donald â€¦ will you get this to Donald?' ' Cary told the paper. 'He said, 'Well dude, we'd be happy to give it to him.' ' Trump calls black supporter a "thug," has him kicked out of a rally in North Carolina. https://t.co/b4gkI6qx9v pic.twitter.com/eJKuu0CLRi 
â€” Jason Sparks (@sparksjls) October 28, 2016 
But it seems that this incident hasn't deterred Cary's support for 'Mr. Donald' who he described as 'an honest person.' 
'I support Trump because he's honest,' Cary said . 'You can work with an honest person and convince them their vision isn't in the best interest of everyone. You can't work with dishonest people. That's why I don't like Obamaâ€”the worst president in American history.' 
Some people never learn.

By Michael Hayne Election 2016 , News , Politics October 28, 2016 Paul Ryan's Plan To Use Bernie To Scare Voters Blew Up In His Face And Bernie Can't Stop Laughing   
The 2016 election continues to be the weirdest, dumbest, and most contentious presidential race in ages. But the one saving grace and glimmer of hope amid this Category 4 sh*tstorm is the idea of an empowered Senator Sanders. 
A week ago, House Speaker Paul Ryan made the fatal mistake of using Bernie Sanders as a scare tactic to ensure that Congress remains in Republican hands. At a gathering of Young Republicans, Ryan implored Republicans to take the polls on Election Day in order to stop the scary ' liberal progressive' agenda. Ryan punctuated his warning by saying ' If we lose the Senate, do you know who becomes chair of the Senate Budget Committee? A guy named Bernie Sanders. You ever heard of him?' 
Well, that single statement appears to have totally blown up in his face. 
It's not yet clear if the populist and beloved Senator from Vermont would chair the Senate Budget Committee should Democrats take back the Senate, but what is clear is that Bernie Sanders is cashing in on Ryan's comments. Paul Ryan said if Republicans lose the Senate, a guy named Bernie Sanders becomes Budget Committee Chair. Sounds like a plan! #ThanksPaul 
â€” Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 24, 2016 
Hoping to convince the intractable 'Bernie or Bust' crowd that a Democratically-controlled Senate is the best way to carry out his very progressive agenda, Sanders implored his 3.76 million followers to donate to Democrats. The Sanders team went so far as launching a 'We Heard You Paul!' appeal to small donors. And it's workingâ€“insanely well. 
'Let's thank Speaker Ryan for helping us raise $2.4 million this week from 500,000 contributions and show everyone how powerful the political revolution still is by using the hashtag #ThanksPaul across all social media channels today,' the Sanders camp announced Monday. 
Sanders is in this thing for the long run and has no intention of slowing down anytime soon. The only way to ensure Ryan's threat becomes a reality is turning the Congress blue.

Oh, the politics are strong with this one. FBI Director James Comey just sent out a letter to the Republican Congressional Committee informing them that the FBI will be looking into more of Hillary Clinton's emails. The discovery of the new emails was 'in connection with an unrelated case.' 
As Think Progress points out, all the letter really means is there are emails that were discovered that the FBI had not reviewed. It doesn't mean a case is being 're-opened.' This does not say the FBI will be reexamining the information of the previous investigation. And, it doesn't mean that all of a sudden criminal charges are going to be forthcoming. It means nothing, except, the FBI needs to read a few more emails that were missed in the previous investigation. 
Even Comey says in his letter: 
'The FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant.' 
Read Republican James Comey's letter, here: 
Yet, the reality of this statement is lost on not only major media outlets who are reporting that the case has been 'reopened,' but also our politicians. Paul Ryan's response takes the cake, though. The Republican Speaker of the House went full knee-jerk with this one. He said in a statement : 
'Yet again, Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame. She was entrusted with some of our nation's most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information. This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators. I renew my call for the Director of National Intelligence to suspend all classified briefings for Secretary Clinton until this matter is fully resolved.' 
So, 11 days before our presidential election, we've had the FBI Director, who happens to be a Republican, release an ambiguous letter which touches on an unsubstantiated scandal for which the Democratic presidential candidate came out of clean as a whistle because charges couldn't be justified. And now we've had the Speaker of the House call for the candidate's intelligence briefings to be suspended 'until this matter is fully resolved.' 
Which, by the way, the FBI Director says he 'cannot predict how long it will take to complete this additional work.' 
Yeah, ok. Like this doesn't have political ploy written all over it. How pathetic.

Hillary supporters can stop panicking. The 'reopening of the FBI's email investigation' story blasted out by every hungry reporter and desperate Republican has already completely fallen apart. It took less than two hours. 
The initial headlines were as grim as they were overblown. Shortly before an official announcement, NBC News leaked the news that the FBI would be looking into newly discovered emails related to the previous Clinton investigation. NBC News: FBI re-opening investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server 
â€” Jesse Rodriguez (@JesseRodriguez) October 28, 2016 
This was important because despite Republicans hanging every last one of their hopes on Hillary being indicted before the election, the FBI investigation found zero evidence of criminal wrongdoing. A new investigation made all those dashed hopes come rushing back. They. Freaked. Out. 
Especially Trump. 
â€” Hallie Jackson (@HallieJackson) October 28, 2016 
However, even as Trump took a meaningless victory lap, the story itself was falling apart. The bombshell turned out to be a dud. 
Over on MSNBC, veteran reporter Pete Williams did what almost no other reporter bothered to â€“ he got to the bottom of it. NBC's Pete Williams: Sr. officials sayâ€”During separate investigation 'a device' led to add'l emailsâ€“not from Clinton https://t.co/QmmNoxXhOx 
â€” Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 28, 2016 
All the 'big' things turned out to not exist. No, there is no evidence to suggest these new emails were covered up. No, they haven't found anything incriminating. No, this isn't a 'reopening' of the case â€“ it was never closed to the begin with and this is a small update not a gamechanger. And perhaps most importantly these emails did not even come from Hillary Clinton . 
Bigger than Watergate? Hardly. 
Like Wikileaks before it, this non-scandal will be used on the right to give the appearance that Hillary Clinton is 'corrupt' without providing any concrete proof beyond it. There is no big story here, but the conservative movement will use it as a pretext to continue harassing Clinton and her campaign with baseless accusations. FBI Director James Comey may have scored a few political points with his Republican colleagues, but his investigation will likely yield zero fresh controversies. 
This is the maddening world we live in. A sham built on a sham built on a sham. It's shams all the way down.

It's always nice to know that some people aren't as concerned with the election as they are with the 'big picture.' For Lance Wallnau, that constitutes turning America into a Fundamentalist Christian nation. Wallnau is a Seven Mountains Dominionist (so is Ted Cruz) who thinks that there is a vast left-wing conspiracy, even though he says he's not really a conspiracy buff. There's some cognitive dissonance for you. 
Appearing on The Jim Bakker Show on Wednesday, Wallnau opened up his big bag of blarney and laid out his theories about the left-wing's diabolical plans to destroy conservatives, especially Christian conservatives. Wallnau thinks that the left has a web of progressive organizations like MoveOn.org, Media Matters and Right Wing Watch that controls the media and decides what Americans think and talk about. 
'They are all independent organizations coordinated by one group of people like us who handle the money. So they'll show up where there's race issuesâ€”boom, and make them inflammatory. They'll show up where there's a campus issueâ€”boom, and make it inflammatory. Then the media machine kicks in, Media Matters, which is run by one of their organizations, and they come in and they get it into the social media channels so it's in Facebook and everything. And you would think all of America's ablaze. It's a handful of funded, executed strategists with entities called 527s that are disciplining America.' 
Where to start with this stew of projection? No one group handles the money for all the liberal advocacy groups. The idea is absurd. These groups do not plot to turn any single issue into an inflammatory one; that happens organically depending on what life brings us. He's never heard of the 'shit happens' theory, I guess. Media Matters is not a media group unto itself, it exists to keep the actual media honest. Social networks? You think anyone can control those? If so, you really are stupid. And those horrible 527s that are controlling this 'disciplining' of America? There are plenty of those on the right, as well. The 527 designation just means it's a non-profit advocacy group. A quick look at the top fifty 527s in this election cycle shows that all sorts of issues and ideologies are represented. 
But Wallnau hasn't emptied his can of crazy yet. Showing an amazing capacity for projection, he explains why Christians are feeling that things are not quite right: 
'The web literally is coming down on America. And what's sad is, how many Christians feel this fog on their head at times? Do you feel that? It's almost like everything's going wrong. And that fog that's on Christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the Body of Christ because there's spirits being authorized to be released.' 
He goes on to blame the imaginary left-wing syndicate for authorizing Satan to run things. Authorize? So Satan has to get a rubber stamp of some kind? Is he the one authorizing the release of those spirits? If he is, he must have mountains of paperwork. One wonders when he has time to tempt anyone. 
Like most pseudo-Christians, Wallnau loves to fall back on the idea that his devil is running things when those things aren't going his way. That's toddler-level thinking. What else would you expect, though, from someone who thinks God sent Donald Trump to be their savior? 
The charge of witchcraft obliges me to repeat things I may have said before but that always bear repeating. Witches do not sit around in groups of 13 trying to figure out ways to ruin the lives of others. We have our own problems and we don't need or want more stuff to deal with. We are not some cabal intent on turning America into a macrocosm of our own ideology. That's the Dominionist's thing. We are quite happy to live out own lives and let others do the same. 
That said, we do get involved in elections. Just like any other American, we volunteer for our candidates. We phone bank and go door-to-door. We vote and encourage others to do the same. If we are working any witchcraft it is the magic of working together to better the lives of everyone. Jim Bakker and Lance Wallnau ought to try it sometime. 
Here's the clip from our conspiracy mates friends at Right Wing Watch

By Wes Williams Election 2016 , Miscellaneous , Politics , Videos October 28, 2016 'I Could Sue You': Trump's Spokeswoman Slanders Angela Rye On Live TV â€“ Gets Epic Smack Down (VIDEO)   
Over the past few months, the on-air battles at CNN between Trump's dumb-as-a-stump surrogate Katrina Pierson and liberal commentator Angela Rye have become legendary. On Friday morning the two put on the gloves to go another round. 
The conversation starts out innocently enough, with a discussion about new economic numbers that show the economy is growing and getting stronger. Great news for Americans â€” except those like Donald Trump, who are looking to benefit politically from the lie that record numbers of people are suffering. Then host Carol Costello plays a clip of Trump telling an Ohio rally that he wants to do something about the inner city 'ghettos.' She observes to Pierson that many black Americans would observe that Trump is not looking at 'the whole of the black population.' 
Pierson responds that some members of the black community have been consulting with Trump about the problem. The look on Rye's face when she says that is classic. When she gets a chance to respond, she says, 
'I think it's really important that when we have conversations like this they're rooted in facts. Let's talk about what Donald Trump could be saying to black people that would resonate and be based in truth.' 
Rye goes on to explain how people like Trump, who have access to capital, don't seem to appreciate that everyone can't get their hands on money to improve their lives. Then she talks about Trump's history as a real estate mogul, who has actually contributed to the creation of the 'ghettos' which he now says he wants to fix. 
Pierson responds that Trump has worked with members of the black community, including Jesse Jackson, to help members of the black community create and build businesses. That promotes a hearty laugh from Rye. Costello notes that Rye was a former director of the Congressional Black Caucus, as she asks her to respond. Pierson cuts in, remarking 'And [she] ran it [the CBC] into the ground.' At that point, the two women drop all pretense of liking each other and the battle is on. Rye unloads on Pierson with a barrage of facts that her poor little Trump-addled brain was probably having difficulty processing. And when Costello tries to rein her in, Rye hits Pierson with a comment right out of Trump's playbook. Referring to the charge she 'ran the CBC into the ground,' Rye says: 
'That's slander. I could sue you, Katrina!' 
Here's the latest round in the Rye-Pierson war of words, via YouTube:

Trump's campaign has been frantic to close the huge gap in donations between Clinton's and their own. By some estimates, Hillary is outspending Trump 7-to-1 in advertising â€“ a steep hill to climb for a campaign that is already losing badly in nearly every battleground state. 
But in his desperation, Trump did something incredibly stupid. He promised his fans that he would 'triple match' any donation over $75 that they made on October 1st. 
His fans, believing Trump would put his money where his mouth is, gave generously. Instead of make good on the promise, Trump donated squat. In fact, his donations for the entire month were less than he should have donated that very first day. On Oct 1, I got an email from Trump pledging to triple donations for 24 hrs. 
Donors gave $165,829 that day. 
Trump gave $30,682 all month. 
â€” Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) October 28, 2016 
Even for Trump's diehard fans, this looks like the man is just the kind of grifter his critics have always claimed he was. Despite pretending to 'self-fund' his campaign, Trump has chipped in hardly anything. He's run his campaign much like he ran his charity, using other people's money to promote himself. 
This is in stark contrast to Trump's boasts. Famously, the candidate once said he was willing to spend upwards of one billion dollars on his campaign to be president. With just 11 days to go, Trump hasn't even come close. Most estimates put his own contribution around $50 million â€“ chump change for an alleged billionaire. Kellyanne Conway: The rest of Trump's $100 million donation to his campaign is still coming (with 11 days left) pic.twitter.com/7U3UF9a0dM 
â€” Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) October 28, 2016 
And it seems Trump's campaign knows how badly he screwed this up. His campaign manager Kellyanne Conway scrambled to the nearest media outlet to proclaim that Trump would absolutely be fulfilling a promise he made to donate $100 million by the election. (Note again: He has just 11 days left to do so.) 
And then Trump himself reportedly wired $10 million to his campaign on Friday morning in a day late, dollar short desperation maneuver to help pull out of this tailspin. Donald Trump wired $10M of his own money into this presidential campaign this morning â€“ Dow Jones 
â€” CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) October 28, 2016 
It's hard to truly be surprised that Trump has been stingy with his own campaign. This is the 'billionaire' who managed to pay no taxes in twenty years and donate almost no money to charity in the same period. He makes Scrooge McDuck look generous. And with less than two weeks to go, Trump's chances of becoming president are looking about as fictional as the cartoon duck. 
Go home, Donald.

Most sane people are horrified at the idea of a Donald Trump presidency. However, there's a substantial portion of the electorate that seems not to see just how absolutely dangerous the guy is as just a presidential candidate, much less how dangerous he would be as president. However, it seems that some of Trump's supporters DO recognize that he's a total nutcase, but plan to vote for him anyway. One woman's reason is truly out of this world. A lady named Crystal said of her choice to vote for Trump: 
'Oh I think he's crazy, and he may get us killed, but at least he's going to be truthful with us.' Ultimate Trump Voter Quote, from Crystal: "Oh I think he's crazy, and he may get us killed, but at least he's going to be truthful with us." pic.twitter.com/Qz4u7OIzB0

The list of women sexually assaulted by Donald J. Trump just keeps growing â€” and a new cringe-inducing video from a 2011 corporate speech adds yet another . In the video, Trump not only sexually assaults, but humiliates, the 2004 Miss Universe winner on stage, in front of thousands. 'She's not very bright' 
Both candidates have had cringe-inducing moments this election cycle, but by-the-by, Clinton's have been significantly less than Trump's have and Trump's have come in rapid succession of horrible moments; a parade of everything wrong with the masculine idea in the United States. A new video posted by the Huffington Post on Saturday added yet another horrible moment to the raft of them â€” a raft that, in any decent society, would have already sunk. 
A few weeks ago, a tape of Donald Trump emerged into the popular conscious. The tape contained two things: Trump admitting that he sexually assaulted women and Trump using the word 'pussy.' No points for guessing which one pissed off more of his evangelical supporters. Since then, a huge number of women have come forward and leveled accusations of sexual assault at Donald Trump. 
Make no mistake, Trump is having his Bill Cosby moment right now. 
Among the list of accusations against Trump include claims that Trump told a group of 10-year-olds that he'd date them in 10 years, a telling a group of 14-year-olds he'd date them in a few years, groping women, sexually assaulting women, and we can't forget that he's been accused of raping a 13-year-old at a party hosted by infamous American financier and level three sex offender Jeffery Epstein (who served three months of an 18 month prison sentence for soliciting sex from an underage prostitute, because we don't have a two-tier justice system at all in the United States). 
Thus, this new footage that shows Trump forcing 2004 Miss Universe winner Jennifer Hawkins into a nonconsensual kiss and then humiliating her on stage isn't an aberration. It's a continuation of the skeevy behavior that a huge number of men are not only okay with, not only think is normal, but believe is something that's worth preserving and perpetuating instead of stamping out like an intellectual scabies infection. 
The video shows Trump calling Hawkins on stage to join him after telling the audience his philosophy of using revenge to succeed in business: 'Get even with people,' he said. 'If they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. I really believe that.' 
There are a few quotes from the Bible that are relevant here, but I'm pretty sure that Biblical literalists and right-wing evangelicals don't know what those quotes are. They're too busy agreeing with Trump. 
Trump was apparently mad at Hawkins the day before because he thought she'd slighted him by declining to introduce him at an event in Sydney â€” Hawkins, it should be noted, is Australian. Once she was onstage with Trump, Hawkings laughed apologetically and said it was a 'miscommunication with my management,' which left her, '[feeling] really bad.' 
Trump seemed to accept this, saying: 'When she found out, she got in her car and she got her ass over here, and I love her.' 
Spray-tan Hitler has a well-known vindictive streak. He at least entertained the possibility of forming a PAC to sink the political careers of Ted Cruz â€” voted second most punchable face in the world after Trump superfan and Breitbart personality Milo Yiannopoulos â€” and John Kasich after the two of them refused to show up at the Republican national convention and kiss his ring. He's threatened to use his power as president to arrest people he disagrees with. To say he's vindictive may well be a British-level understatement (and if he's elected, it'll definitely be a British-level mistake). 
That vindictive streak is probably what led to the sequence of bizarre events that followed, culminating ultimately with Trump forcing a nonconsensual kiss on Hawkins. 
First, he described how he would have embarrassed Hawkin if she'd really slighted him: 'I was actually going to get up and tell you that Jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside, but she's not very bright. That wouldn't have been true, but I would have said it anyway.' 
Trump then made a sexual pun, and of course lingered on it until the audience got it or laughed out of awkwardness, I can't be sure which: 'And you know what? She came tonight, she came â€” came, she came, she came.' Once the audience laughed, Trump added: 'See, so they have the same filthy minds in Australia.' 
Then he grabbed her around the waist and forced a kiss on her. This is pretty much on par with what others have accused Trump of doing â€” according to Cathy Heller, who claims that Trump assaulted her at a Mother's Day brunch at Mar-a-Lago : 'He took my hand, and grabbed me, and went for the lips,' she claimed. Alarmed, she said she leaned backwards to avoid him and almost lost her balance. 'And he said, 'Oh, come on.' He was strong. And he grabbed me and went for my mouth and went for my lips.' She turned her head, she claims, and Trump planted a kiss on the side of her mouth. 'He kept me there for a little too long,' Heller said. 'And then he just walked away.' 
If you feel like you need a shower after this, just remember: you probably have a relative who thinks voting for this man is a good idea.

Voter fraud has been on the minds of Republicans for a while now. It has been proven that while yes, there are isolated incidences of in-person voter fraud, there has never been a case where it was so rampant that it changed the results of an election. But that's exactly what the GOP wants you to think is going on. 
Donald Trump took Republican rhetoric about voter fraud and has ramped it up to an entirely new level, claiming that the upcoming election is going to be 'rigged.' Apparently, Republicans are in on this alleged rigging along with Democrats, since a number of the states where the vote looks to be close are controlled by the GOP. And as everyone outside of Trump's basket of deplorables knows, election mechanics are handled by the states, not the federal government. 
How are Trump's supporters reacting to all of his claims about voter fraud? Well, in at least one case the answer to that question is 'By committing voter fraud themselves.' 
Terri Lynn Rote, 55, an Iowa Trump supporter, has been charged with 'election misconduct,' which is a Class D felony in the state. According to Iowa Public Radio, Rote allegedly voted for Trump twice when she cast her ballot during early voting. And her reason? She was afraid that her first vote would be changed to a vote for Hillary Clinton, so she voted again. The Des Moines Register reports that Rote voted once at the Polk County elections office , then again at a county satellite polling location. 
Rote told Iowa Public Radio, 
'I wasn't planning on doing it twice, it was spur of the moment. The polls are rigged.' 
According to the Register, Rote's case was one of three voter fraud cases that occurred in Polk County alone. The other two incidents involved people who voted on mail-in ballots, then voted again in person. Polk County auditor Jamie Fitzgerald says this is the first time in his 12 years in office he has had to deal with even one case of voter fraud, let alone three. There are no details about who the other two suspects cast ballots for. The sad thing is, polls have been saying for weeks that Trump is going to win Iowa. Cases like this might put his win there in question, which would be a perfect example of poetic justice. 
This is what the rhetoric about voter fraud has come t0 â€” people attempting to vote multiple times because they're convinced that their chosen candidate is going to be cheated out of a legitimate win. Republicans, unwilling to accept that their policies are being rejected by a larger and larger segment of the U.S. population, are trying to sell the message that elections are being stolen from the GOP by 'massive' voter fraud. Yet, time after time, it seems to be Republicans who are committing the lion's share of it. They claim to love the country, but Trump and the GOP are deliberately undermining the foundation of a democracy â€” the integrity of the vote. Next, Trump will claim that people like Terri Rote are 'political prisoners.' Just wait for it.

On Wednesday night, Donald Trump had a black man kicked out of his rally in North Carolina. 
'We have a protester! Were you paid $1500 to be a thug?' 
Well, the joke was on Trump, because the man he called 'thug' was actually there supporting him, and for some odd reasonâ€¦he still is. 
RELATED: Trump Calls Black Man At Rally A 'Thug,' Kicks Him Out â€“ Except There's One Big Problem 
On Friday night's episode of Real Time With Bill Maher , CNN's Van Jones sat down with Maher, one on one, and addressed the issue of Donald Trump's dangerous, racist rhetoric and said that if Trump were black, people would be hearing his words in a completely different way. 
'If Trump were black, we'd be calling him a thug!' 
Bill Maher took that point further saying that if Barack Obama were caught on tape saying, 'Give me a tic tac', because when you're a 'community organizer,' they'll just let you do whatever you want â€“'grab em by the p*ssy,' people would be outraged. 
Let's face it â€” President Obama wouldn't have gotten anywhere near the White House if he did the things that Trump has been caught doing, and would likely be under indictment (or possibly in prison) for sexual assault. Why does it continue to be acceptable for Trump to behave this way and get away with it? The double standard is really getting old.

By Thamiel Rosenkreuz Election 2016 , Politicians Behaving Badly , Politics October 30, 2016 Literally Election Fraud: Trump Tells Followers To Vote 'Four Or Five Times' To Ensure Race Isn't 'Rigged' Against Him   
The Republicans' fear of voter fraud may yet come true â€” mostly because it looks like the Republicans are going to be the ones instigating it, thanks to Donald Trump, who basically told his followers on Sunday to go out and steal the election. 'Four or five times' 
There's been a lot of digital ink spilled this election on the delusional claims of voter fraud, but what I think is interesting is that this highlights just how ready the right-wing is to divorce itself from the electoral process entirely . They've lost the popular vote five of the last six elections, and if things go the way they're going and American liberals get out to vote, it's going to be six of the last seven on the morning of November 9. 
Trump and the Republican Party would like their followers to believe that this isn't because their ideology is painfully out of step with the country in modern times. Instead, Trump claims the election will be stolen from him â€“ whether by 'Mexicans,' or the media, or a 'cabal of international bankers.' 
But see, here's the thing: there is a self-proclaimed billionaire who's working to undermine the election, and it's not Carlos Slim â€” it's Donald J. Trump and his paranoid loony bin followers, which include a disturbing number of white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazis, and John Birch dropouts. 
While speaking to a crowd at a rally in Greeley, Colorado late Sunday, Trump once again cast doubts on the mail-in ballots , encouraging people to get another ballot and mail that one in , too. Over and over: 
'Who has sent their ballots in? And do you think those ballots are properly counted?' Trump asked the audience, to which they replied 'No!' 
Trump continued by expressing his skepticism and telling supporters to go get new ballots to ensure their vote is counted. 
' If you go to university center, they'll give you a new ballot, they'll void your old ballot, in some places they do that four or five times, so by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in. ' 
CNN said the comment was 'stoking skepticism' because they don't have the wherewithal to call this what it really is: encouraging voter fraud. 
'Liberal media' my ass. 
And it appears to be having an effect. Some of Trump's followers have already taken this message to heart, and at least one has already been arrested for it . 
Between these clowns and the clowns that are going to 'make sure there isn't any illegal voting at the booths'â€” i.e, instigate voter intimidation against Hispanics, Arabs, African-Americans and anyone else who doesn't look like a white Trump supporter â€” one gets the feeling that election night is going to be a chaotic one.

The decision of FBI Director Comey to go public with a supposed 'bombshell' investigation into new Hillary emails was welcomed by Trump as the mainstream media recklessly reported on this total dud of a controversy. It basically dominated the news cycle all day and probably will until we all cast out our vote next Tuesday (or November 28th if you support Trump.) 
But the politically motivated and reckless actions of Comey have many outraged, including Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid 
Senator Reid appeared with Clinton today to push back against the 'inappropriate,' 'unprecedented,' and 'puzzling' move by FBI Director James Comey to suddenly go public with new emails. Roughly two months removed from retirement, Reid is waging an all-out war on Comey as he claims a 'disturbing double standard' took place in the FBI's decision to publish this misleading announcement while essentially ignoring Trump. 
Reid pointed specifically to information the FBI allegedly has that ties Trump to Russia â€“ information Reid says they have intentionally sat on in order to not hurt the candidate's chances of being elected. 
He expressed his ire in a blistering letter to Comey. Here's a key passage: 
Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law. 
And it's not as though one can accuse Reid of being blindly partisan since he previously defended Comey when Republicans tried to filibuster his nomination and subsequently delay his confirmation. Reid wrote: 
'I believed you to be a principled public servant.' 
The actions of Comey were indeed politically motivated as he desperately wished to be loved again by law & order conservatives. But Reid just opened up a whole new can of worms.

A short summation of this election cycle would read more like a spy novel than it would a typical race. There's been Russian intrigue, neo-Nazi violence, backstabbing, double-dealing, conspiracies, hidden foreign connections, and even a full-on James Bond-like supervillain. The world seems to have flipped upside-down, making former friends enemies and former enemies friends. 
And the latest case of that is Fox's Jeanine Pirro, who early on Sunday, took to the airwaves to side with Hillary Clinton in being critical of FBI director James Comey's announcement of new emails last week . Yes, a Fox News anchor sided with Clinton. 
Maybe the Mayans were right about this whole end of the world stuff, but they forgot to carry a zero and were a couple of years off. 'All that is wrong with Washington' 
There are so many non-scandals concerning email swirling around Clinton that it can be difficult to keep them separate, and they tend to blur together in a big ball of nonsense â€” unless you're a right-winger, in which case you probably have a detailed ledger of all the scandals and update that ledger daily. 
The latest scandal comes from FBI director James Comey, who, last week, revealed that the FBI had found additional emails they were investigating. Comey, in his infinite good sense, announced this publically, less than two weeks before the election, because nobody would assume that was good old-fashioned Nixonian ratfucking. 
Except that's exactly what happened, and that's not just my read on the situation â€” it's also Judge Jeanine Pirro's read on it, too. 
While speaking early Sunday morning, Pirro ripped into Comey, denouncing him as 'symptomatic of all that is wrong with Washington.' Pirro continued : 
'One of the most revered agencies in our nation's historyâ€“now seen as putting its finger on the scales of justiceâ€“should not now be front and center. You know I support Donald Trump and want him to win, but whether it's Hillary Clinton or anyone else, Comey's actions violate not only longstanding Justice Department policyâ€¦but the most fundamental rules of fairness and impartiality.' 
Comey, it should be noted, made his announcement without the backing of the Department of Justice . The most generous reading about this is that Comey made a short-sighted mistake and needs to be reprimanded. The most cynical reading is that Comey chose his timing so he could try to torpedo Clinton's campaign. 
Comey's announcement confused aids and prosecutors , too, with some wondering why he would drop a 'bombshell which could be a big dud' and others accusing him of acting 'irresponsibly.' 
Pirro explained she had something like this happen to her; she ran for New York attorney general about 10 years ago, and when she was in the homestretch, the Justice Department and the FBI broke the policy prohibiting public statements that affect elections and said they were going to open an investigation of Pirro. 
Pirro called it 'mean-spirited' and noted that it was bootless, with the only direct result being it cost her at the polls. 
At any rate, there's an old saying about stopped clocks on military time that's relevant here. Watch the video below:

Since Sarah Palin is like herpes and will never quite go away, people in the media still seem interested in her and her famous word salads. For whatever reason (trolling?), the Washington Post recently asked the quitting snow grifter to write an op-ed piece on the significance of Hillary Clinton being picked as the first woman president should she win the Nov. 8 election. Palin was among a number of women invited to write pieces reflecting, in some personal way, on the meaning and significance of the election of the first woman as president. 
'Obviously, a Clinton victory is not assured,' cautioned Michael Larabee, the op-ed editor for the Washington Post . 'But we're hoping to gather the essays in advance so we can share them quickly if she is elected.' 
This is when the verbal diarrhea really hit the floor. She took her word salad game to new heights : 
Media mocks Trump's 'rigged election' warning to its own peril. 
More evidence in my inbox, this time from the Washington Post requesting I write an op-ed commemorating their coronation of Hillary â€“ 10 days from now. This is hilarious! 
Good ol' reliable WaPo â€“ continuing its embarrassing fail that's reminiscent of their forced correction after irresponsibly, absurdly claiming I joined Al Jazera; announcing to the world their goal was to not mention my name in print for an entire month (oh, what a blessed month that was!) and relentlessly suggesting my (and other Conservatives) irrelevancy in national discourse â€“ assuming I'd participate in their in-the-tank shenanigans for the Globalists. 
No, Mr. WaPo Editor, can't say I'm interested in writing for you. But I'd love a copy of your pre-printed post-election edition shipped to me in Alaska. Your bold 'Clinton Defeats Trump' headline will be framed right next to another old rag we're all familiar withâ€¦ 
There has to be a statute of limitation on the victim card, which Sarah has been using for 8 years. Ever since she lost, it's been one aggrevieved statement after another. Now she is doing double duty: Falsely claiming the Washington Post is 'coronating' Hillary (they weren't) and falsely claiming they are out to get her (they aren't).

Trump's chances of winning Tuesday's election are pretty close to zero. Nearly everyone both inside and outside his campaign understands that, except him. Trump is a type A personality taken to extremes and he cannot accept failure. When faced with an actual loss (and in this case a humiliating national one), his mind creates a counter narrative that he can accept. Things are rigged. The race was stolen. Everyone is against him. 
I'm not just saying this because he looks crazy on TV. Plenty of people have come forward with some pretty horrific tales of what happens when Trump feels like he's lost something. Even the littlest loss will set him into a tale spin of self-deception. Take Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter , who made an off-hand comment in Spy Magazine about Trump's small hands. For the last 30 years he's been receiving odd notes: 
To this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump. There is always a photo of himâ€”generally a tear sheet from a magazine. On all of them he has circled his hand in gold Sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers. I almost feel sorry for the poor fellow because, to me, the fingers still look abnormally stubby. 
Then there's Selina Scott who also claims to have received weird little love notes from Trump calling her 'sleazy' and suggesting she's not a very good journalist. This after Trump tried and failed to seduce her. 
Trump also tried a similar tact with Selma Hayek; first he asked her out and then once she refused, he attacked. She says that he leaked a story to the National Enquirer that he turned her down because she was too short. (Later, he attempted to turn that smear into a positive by suggesting she go out with him to prove the story wrong. Classy.) 
That's exactly what seems to be going on inside the Trump campaign right now. There's a lot of anger and a lot of bizarre story-telling an anonymous Trump staffer told New York Magazine . He compares the atmosphere to what being in the bunker with Hitler must have been like just before he killed himself. People are all smiling at meetings and then returning to their offices to desperately search for work elsewhere. Kellyanne Conway, Trump's newest campaign manager, is increasingly upset with him over his lack of strategy. Supposedly, before Paul Manafort left the Trump campaign he suggested that they try to keep Trump completely out of the public eye: 
The best thing we can do is to have you move into a cave for the next four months. If you're not on the campaign trail, the focus is on her, and we win. 
In just over a week, Trump will have another loss to rationalize away. It's likely to get pretty ugly and someone no doubt will receive some creepy news clippings in the mail. But just remember that not long ago this guy was actually neck and neck with Hillary Clinton. This bizarre sex-crazed business baby could have actually wound up being our next president. So congratulations America; but also, get your shit together.

I owe our readers an apology. 
In covering the ludicrous letter sent by FBI Director James Comey to Republicans that misleadingly suggested new emails had been uncovered implicating Hillary Clinton in criminal activity, out of an abundance of caution I gave Comey the benefit of the doubt . Maybe this wasn't overtly partisan electioneering by a Republican FBI director abusing his position? Maybe he just screwed up massively? 
That generous interpretation has all but been torched by Comey himself. Days after his letter made its way to Hillary's political enemies (including Donald Trump), Comey has yet to set the record straight. The scandal has completely fallen to pieces around him. His own behavior in producing the letter, legal experts say, bordered on criminal . But Comey remains silent. He doesn't even have the decency to admit he screwed up. 
And that silence has enabled Republicans to continue lying about what is happening. Trump himself tells his supporters that the FBI director is pursuing a 'criminal investigation' against Clinton â€“ a blatant lie that could easily be snuffed out with a single message by the suddenly bashful Comey. We are now leading in many polls, and many of these were taken before the criminal investigation announcement on Friday â€“ great in states! 
â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2016 
Instead of setting the record straight, and doing a small part to repair the damage to American democracy he had done, Comey is telling sources that he will refuse to clarify the anti-Hillary letter until after the election . Trump is probably high fiving his campaign staff right now. 
NBC's Pete Williams (whose track record covering the botched FBI letter has been impeccable): Pete Williams reports that Comey is UNLIKELY to say anything more before the election 
â€” Sam Stein (@samsteinhp) October 30, 2016 
So having felt totally comfortable with hurting Hillary Clinton's campaign (over what amounts to nothing), Comey now decides it would be unfair to Trump to come out with the truth. That is a level of partisanship that is hard to wrap one's head around. 
And sadly, many people seem to be unaware that this new Clinton scandal has been completely manufactured by Comey and the Republican Party. According to poll expert Nate Silver, the post-'FBI letter' polls show Clinton's lead dropping. If Democrats keep their eyes on the prize, it shouldn't cost her the election, but it may diminish her chances of succeeding in creating the landslide required to completely eradicate 'Trumpism' from American politics. 
You may not find that on the law books anywhere, but that is a crime nonetheless.

Elections only work if the population consents to the legitimacy of the other side's victory, and that's why Donald Trump's sour grapes rhetoric about voter fraud is so dangerous. Trump, of course, isn't alone in his degenerate thinking, but honestly, he's got the biggest stage to preach it from. 
And he's only ramped that rhetoric up as the polls have shown his campaign going downhill. It's not enough to make me comfortable â€” I hope that American liberals get out and vote against him â€” but it's enough to make Trump feel the burn. His claims of voter fraud are little more than whining, but that doesn't stop people from believing claims like the one he made at a Colorado rally on Saturday, where he said election officials would throw away mail-in ballots if they don't 'like' them. 'Real Problem' 
However, it's worth analyzing his previous claims all the same. Trump claimed that an International Cabal of Bankers is conspiring with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim to 'rig' the American election and bring a permanent end to the United States . If this sounds completely insane to you, that's because it is. 
However, it's worth noting the things that the average American is going to miss in that statement. 
For instance, 'international cabal of bankers' is pretty transparent talk for 'Jews.' One of the major conspiracy theories of these Antisemitic loons is the International Jewish banker conspiracy â€” it's so important that it has its own fiction novel devoted to it (it was one of Henry Ford's favorite books): Protocols of the Elders of Zion . In fact, when I typed 'cabal of international bankers' in Google, it helpfully suggested 'elders of zion' as a related search. Given his voter base consists of white nationalists, the KKK, neo-Nazis, and racists in general, it shouldn't surprise you to learn he might as well be quoting from the seminal work of Antisemitism. 
And if you think I'm reading too much into this, let me remind you that his foreign policy advisor allegedly said that the Nazi ovens were 'too small' to kill six million Jewish people . His alt-right supporters have savaged Jewish reporter simply for being Jewish . Antisemitism swirls around the man. 
Trump's latest made up accusations aren't couched in the same extremely transparent and Antisemitic rhetoric that his usual accusations are. Instead, they're the sort of straightforward nonsense that we've come to expect from Agent Orange when he attempts to speak a mind he doesn't have. 
While speaking before a Colorado rally on Saturday, Trump told the audience that election officials are going to 'throw out' mail-in ballots they disagree with, saying: 
'I have real problems with ballots being sent. People say, oh, here's a ballot, bing. Here's another ballot, throw it away. Oh, here's one I like, we'll keep that one.' Trump talks voter fraud in Colorado; says he has a "real problem" with mail in ballots. (h/t @ergold ) pic.twitter.com/FS0LUOhIVc 
â€” Ali Vitali (@alivitali) October 29, 2016 
Trump seems to think that there are going to be a 'lot of people watching' to make sure that the ballots are correct, which is utterly delusional at best and disastrous at worst. These walking poster children for Dunning-Kruger have no idea what they're doing; they're armed, emotionally charged, racist, clueless, and out to protect 'their country'â€” which doesn't include people like me. 
Perhaps they should all wear brown shirts, too. That way, police know who to remove once they've cast their vote. 
'We're trying to have some pretty good supervision out there,' he warned. 
Sure you are. If by 'supervision' you mean people carrying out voter intimidation. Because that's exactly what'll happen.

Republicans just can't quit fantasizing about doing bodily harm to Hillary Clinton. Over the weekend, Sen. Richard Burr noticed a picture of Clinton hanging in a gun shop and decided the owners should put a 'bullseye' on it. 
Speaking to GOP volunteers on Saturday , Burr joked that he had recently visited a gun shop and 'nothing made me feel better' than seeing a magazine about rifles'with a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it.' 
'I was a little bit shocked at that â€” it didn't have a bullseye on it,' Burr told the crowd in Mooresville, North Carolina. 'But on the bottom right (of the magazine), it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for. So let me assure you, there's an army of support out there right now for our candidates.' 
Burr's comments echo those of his party's presidential nominee, Donald Trump, who has called on the 'Second Amendment people' to 'do something' about his Democratic opponent. However, Burr is at least pretending that he feels bad about his remarks. 
The Senate Intelligence Committee chairman issued an apology on Monday. 'The comment I made was inappropriate, and I apologize for it,' Burr said. 
A Burr campaign official said the Senator's remark about feeling 'better' had nothing at all to do with the idea of Clinton being shot. Really. He was just referring to the support other right-wing candidates have gotten from various gun rights groups. Honest. 
Burr also said that if he is re-elected and Hillary should happen to win the White House, he will do all he can to continue obstructing the appointment of a ninth Supreme Court justice. When asked about the possibility of Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee, being appointed, Burr said, 'it isn't going to happen â€” period.' 
'And if Hillary Clinton becomes president, I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the Supreme Court.' 
Burr also made it clear that he considers being responsible for the 'longest judicial vacancy in history' a badge of honor. 
You can listen to Burr fantasize about 'bullseyes' on Hillary Clinton, here :

It was recently noted that superhero costumes were far outpacing princess ones as children's Halloween outfits of choice this year . But what would be dead last? Probably the hackneyed political groan-inducer dreamed up by Liz Cheney for her daughter. 
For inexplicable reasons, Liz Cheney â€“ daughter of America's most detestable former vice president, Dick â€“ decided to staple a bunch of pieces of office scrap paper onto her daughter and send her to school as 'Hillary Clinton's deleted emails.' Ugh. 
On social media, proud mom Liz even boasted about the costume. Trick or treat? Our daughter Gracie went to school in the scariest of Halloween costumes: Hillary Clinton's deleted emails. #HappyHalloween pic.twitter.com/Gs33p78FJT 
â€” Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) October 31, 2016 
It's hard to imagine a less 'cool' thing to go as than the living embodiment of a manufactured right-wing scandal that only aging conservatives cared about in the first place. Teens, whom already lean heavily liberal, probably won't spontaneously become registered Republicans because a classmate showed up covered in paper. Making matters worse, the costume's gimmick isn't even obvious. Kids will have to go up to Gracie and ask 'So what are you supposed to be?' And she will have to respond, time and again, 'I'm Hillary Clinton's deleted emails. Those things your grandfather was yelling about at the family reunion and quite literally nobody else is interested in.' 
And because irony died and was buried in a shallow grave this year, Liz Cheney didn't bother to justify her own father's carelessness with emails. Forget the 33,000 emails, the Bush Administration 'lost' or 'deleted' over 22 million. Guess whose emails 'disappeared' most often? 
Most troubling, researchers found a suspicious pattern in the White House email system blackouts, including periods when there were no emails available from the office of Vice President Dick Cheney. 'That the vice president's office, widely characterized as the most powerful vice president in history, should have no archived emails in its accounts for scores of daysâ€”especially days when there was discussion of whether to invade Iraqâ€”beggared the imagination,' says Thomas Blanton, director of the Washington-based National Security Archive. 
I guess stapling 22 million emails to her daughter would be a bit impractical, though. Maybe they should have stuck with a superhero costume.

On Sunday, during an appearance on Fox and Friends , Trump surrogate Brunell Donald-Kyei went into full-blown Mad Hatter mode as she 'argued' the significance of the FBI's recent announcement concerning Hillary Clinton's emails. 
During the segment, after proclaiming that she's an 'attorney,' the Vice-Chair of Trump's National Diversity Coalition declared that the FBI doesn't just 'reopen cases.' However, panelist Brian Benjamin observed that the FBI had not officially reopened the case against Clinton (most likely due to the fact that they have not actually found anything). 
This unauthorized use of logic on the Fox News channel prompted Donald-Kyei to quickly dive down a rabbit hole of far-right-wing conspiracy theories, first citing the Wikileaks Podesta emails as proof of Clinton's corruption and then implying something much darker about the presidential candidate. 
'We've got Huma Abedin with 10,000 emails under 'life insurance' because she doesn't want an accidental death,' declared the Trump surrogate. 
Um. What? 
She then went on to rail against Clinton and Obama, accusing both of making race relations worse over the past eight years. 
'Hillary Clinton is running around saying [that], when she and the president have worked so hard over the last eight years to divide the country.' 
Without citing any concrete evidence, the attorney claimed that both Clinton and Obama worked to pit 'whites against blacks, blacks against Hispanics,' and 'Hispanics against Asians.' 
She further argued that unlike Obama and Clinton, Trump would bring Americans together. 
Donald-Kyei concluded her rant with a prediction as bulletproof as her logic. 
'Believe me, believe me, they are convening a grand jury,' Donald-Kyei exclaimed . 'Trust me!' 
Donald Trump must have the greatest collection of mentally unbalanced, intellectually dishonest, and morally dubious surrogates of any presidential candidate in U.S. history.

By April Hamlin Election 2016 , Politics , Videos November 2, 2016 Louis C.K. Just Gave The Best Assessment Of The 2016 Election Yet â€“ And He's With Her (VIDEO)   
Louis C.K. just summed up the 2016 election in a few short minutes and he absolutely nailed it. And in case you were wondering, he is definitely with her. 
The Emmy award-winning actor sat down with Conan O'Brien and explained that he isn't voting for Hillary Clinton because he thinks she is the lesser of two evils. He is voting for her because he thinks she is the best person for the job. 
He pointed out that Clinton won't just be the first woman to serve as president of the United States, she will be the first mother to hold the office. This he said, makes all the difference. Up until now, we have only had fathers in the White House. 
'A great father can give a kid 40 percent of his needs. Tops,' C.K. said. On the other hand, he continued, 'any mother, just a shitty mother, a not even trying mother? 200 percent.' 
C.K. continued, pointing out that despite all the abuse she has taken over the years, she is still kicking a** and taking names. After giving what may be the best endorsement of Clinton that I have heard to date, he then broke the election down in terms that were crystal clear and added that 'if you're a liberal who's not gonna vote, you're a piece of shit.' 
'If you vote for Hillary you're a grownup; if you vote for Trump you're a sucker; if you don't vote for anyone, you're an asshole.' 
Watch Louis C.K. explain why we need 'a tough bitch mother' sitting in the Oval Office, here. It's definitely one you don't want to miss:

With Hillary Clinton making history this election season by becoming the first women nominated by a major party, the sexism has been on full display. The misogynists on the Right have questioned her health, her stamina, and everything in between. That is, of course, code for 'the little woman doesn't belong in the Oval Office.' However, one Texas Republican has taken the misogyny to a whole other level. 
Meet Sid Miller, the Agriculture Commissioner for the state of Texas. He is also a former lawmaker. Miller, like most Republicans, doesn't make his hatred for Hillary Clinton any secret. Instead, he somehow thought that it was perfectly appropriate to take to Twitter and express his feelings in a most disgusting way while tweeting about the polls. Miller's tweet reads: 
'TRUMP 44 Cunt 43,' punctuated with a cheering 'Go Trump Go!' 
In the predictable firestorm after, Miller tried to make the public believe that his account was hacked. Miller's staff hastily relesed this defense of his post: 
'The campaign was retweeting information today and inadvertently retweeted a tweet that they were not aware contained a derogatory term. The tweet was taken down as soon as possible. Commissioner Miller finds the term vulgar and offensive and apologizes to anyone who may have seen it.' 
There's a problem with that, though: The tweet was not a retweet. It was simply a tweet. Therefore, either Sid Miller himself or someone on his staff wrote this: 
Naturally, Miller is Donald Trump's number one man in Texas, according to the Texas Tribune . No surprise there. Further, Miller is no stranger to making tasteless and offensive jokes with regards to Hillary. Here is one that is just a few hours old as of this writing: 
That tweet written in reference to the fact that the reason Hillary's emails are in the news again is because of disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner's sexting scandals. 
So, in other words, this Sid Miller character is the perfect Donald Trump supporter â€“ a misogynistic and deeply ignorant asshat who can't stand the idea of losing to a woman.

By Jameson Parker News , Politics November 1, 2016 INFURIATING: One Week Before The Election And The FBI AGAIN Tries To F*ck Over Hillary's Campaign   
There is something ugly happening within the FBI and it could have major implications for the presidential election. 
On the heels of FBI Director's bone-headed, possibly illegal letter misleadingly suggesting Hillary Clinton is being re-investigated for her emails, the FBI's 'Records Vault' Twitter account doubled-down on the pro-Trump Hillary smears by inexplicably tweeting the records of 'a 2001 FBI investigation into the pardon of Marc Rich'â€“ a matter that was settled over a decade ago and has absolutely no bearing on the current election. William J. Clinton Foundation: This initial release consists of material from the FBI's files related to the Willâ€¦ https://t.co/Y4nz3aRSmG 
â€” FBI Records Vault (@FBIRecordsVault) November 1, 2016 
The ancient nontroversy was provided with absolutely zero context or explanation. In fact, this single cryptic tweet is the only thing the FBI Records Vault has tweeted in the past 36 hours. However, just like FBI Director James Comey's letter to Republicans, it will be used by Clinton's opponents â€“ particularly Trump's campaign â€“ to fan the flames of 'scandal.' 
The question on everyone's mind is: Why? Why tweet this? And why tweet this just one week before an election that has already been marred with too many false scandals and misleading announcements? 
The decision is baffling and unprecedented. As demonstrated by Washington Post 's political reporter Peter Stevenson's stunned reaction. So, an FBI account is tweeting things about the Clinton foundation. Appears to be from 2001 investigation into several of Clinton's pardons https://t.co/PDIwBYueIO 
â€” Peter Stevenson (@PeterWStevenson) November 1, 2016 
And Clinton campaign staffer Brian Fallows's even more stunned reaction: Absent a FOIA litigation deadline, this is odd. Will FBI be posting docs on Trump's housing discrimination in '70s? https://t.co/uJMMzX6rtI 
â€” Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) November 1, 2016 
Comey has been rightly slammed for his decision to meddle in the election contrary to FBI policy not to get involved in politics, but even his critics were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder â€“ a staunch Democrat â€“ called Comey an 'honorable man' who made a massive mistake. Now that assessment seems far too kind. The FBI is dumping opposition research to the public that hurts Hillary Clinton and favors Donald Trump. 
Not that the FBI Records Vault has been completely silent about Trump â€“ but when it does speak about him, its tone is much more deferential. If the FBI's policy is to keep politics out of it, they are only achieving that when it comes to Trump. Two days previously, it tweeted a brief write up about Donald Trump's father. It describes him a 'philanthropist' and the release appears mostly harmless. Fred C. Trump: Fred C. Trump (1905-1999) was a real estate developer and philanthropist. This release consists ofâ€¦ https://t.co/21KgtPpmzk

At the same time, it's carefully withholding information regarding its investigations into Donald Trump's businesses and his connections to the Russian government . This imbalance is so clear that it stretches the imagination to the breaking point to believe it was done on accident. 
As the race tightens in the closing week of the election, the fact that a government agency would repeatedly throw its weight behind one candidate over another â€“ and do so in a way that is inherently dishonest â€“ is infuriating. The damage being done to the FBI's claim to objectivity is possibly irrevocable.

By Joe Clark Crime , Election 2016 , Politicians Behaving Badly , Politics , Videos November 1, 2016 If You Thought The Trump Child Rape Case In NY Couldn't Get Much Worse â€” You Were Wrong   
On November 9, 2016, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump could become the first president-elect to be named as a defendant in a child rape case. 
A woman named Katie Johnson filed a 100 million dollar federal lawsuit against Trump in a New York federal court this summer. 
Johnson filed a similar federal lawsuit in California on May 2, but her case was thrown out due to a clerical error. 
The alleged victim later refiled her case in a New York federal court. 
Johnson accuses Trump along with his long time friend Jeff Epstein, who's also a billionaire financier and convicted sex offender, of raping a woman when she was only 13-years-old in 1994. 
In a court affidavit, the alleged victim, who is identified in court documents as 'Jane Doe,' said that Trump hit her and raped her while she was tied to a bed in Epstein's posh upper east side New York apartment. 
Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from an underage girl. He served 13 months of an 18-year prison term before being released. 
In the affidavit, Johnson also mentions that Trump threatened her life. 
The alleged victim's accounts are corroborated by two witnesses (identified in court records as 'Joan Doe' and 'Tiffany Doe'), who allegedly worked as 'party planners' for Epstein. 
'I personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the Plaintiff was forced to have with Mr. Trump during this period, including the fourth of these encounters where Mr. Trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stop,' Tiffany Doe alleges . 
Tiffany Doe also claimed to have witnessed Trump force Jane Doe and an unidentified 12-year-old girl (identified in court records as Maria) to perform oral sex on him, then continue to physically abuse the girls after the act concluded. 
In court documents, Tiffany Doe said that part of her job was to 'personally witness and supervise encounters between the underage girls that Mr. Epstein hired and his guests.' 
According to the former 'party planner,' both Trump and Epstein threatened Jane Doe if she ever revealed what they had done. They used Maria's disappearance as collateral that they would make good on their threat, implying that they had the girl murdered. 
'I personally witnessed Defendant Trump telling the Plaintiff that she shouldn't ever say anything if she didn't want to disappear like the 12-year-old female Maria, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed,' Tiffany Doe alleged. 
When Tiffany Doe stopped working for Epstein in 2002, she said the billionaire threatened to kill her and her family if she ever came forward about his activities. 
'I fully understand that that the life of myself and my family is now in grave danger,' she said. 
A federal judge has ordered a hearing concerning Johnson's case to be held on December 16.

President Obama is known for his humor, but his interview with Samantha Bee is downright hilarious. 
During his final days in office, Obama has been making rounds on talk shows. When he sat down with the host of Full Frontal this week, the result was simply priceless. 
Bee took a few shots at him for his age, asking if he would consider an appearance on Antique Roadshow and pointing out the white in his hair. Obama reminded her that he was still president, after all, but Bee was hell bent on making this an interview to remember. 
She finally asked Obama if he would 'mess' with Donald Trump once he was done serving as Commander in Chief. 
'After you leave office, have you thought of just whispering in Donald Trump's ear, 'You were right, I wasn't born here,' just to, like, mess with him?' Bee asked. 
'I think it's fair to say that I will be organizing my post-presidency where I'm not close enough to him to whisper into his ear,' Obama shot back. 
They did discuss some important issues, such as young voters and the struggles that Hillary Clinton may face as the first woman to serve as President of the United States. But the playful back and forth between President Obama and Bee is too funny to miss. It also reminds us just why it is that we are going to miss this man so much when he is gone.

Just one week until Election Day, Walker decided he would use his social media account to help get Donald Trump elected. Instead, he gave every single Democrat in the country more than enough of a reason to vote for Hillary. Oops.

In Walker's right-wing bubble that may be a stinging critique. To most of America, that's a great reason to vote Hillary. President Obama is currently seeing his favorability ratings surging. His presidency, and the accomplishments he's made during it, are very popular. At this moment, Gallup found 54 percent of Americans said they approved of Obama. His popularity outstrips Republican icon Ronald Reagan at the same time during his presidency. 
Lots of people like the past 8 years under Obama .

Harry Reid Vindicated: The FBI Is Sitting On Info Of Russian Operation 'To Cultivate Donald Trump' 10492   
Outgoing Senator Harry Reid took a lot of flack for speaking out about the double standard that exists between how the FBI treats Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Many, even on the left, slammed Reid as a conspiracy nut for suggesting the FBI was sitting on information explicitly linking Russia and Trump. Left-leaning New Republic was particularly brutal: Republicans are right: Hary Reid should be ashamed of himself . 
Instead, he's been vindicated. 
Just one day after making the remarks, several explosive stories dropped coming from entirely separate journalists that document several ways in which Trump is tied to Russia â€“ and the FBI knows about it. 
According to a report by NBC News, the FBI is making 'preliminary inquiry' into Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort for his ties to Russian businesses. Trump himself is rumored to have business interests linked to Russia â€“ but has thus far refused calls to release his tax returns to disprove it. Even more critically, Mother Jones spoke to an unnamed counterintelligence officer who said that the FBI has more information than they are letting on. 
â€¦a former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence tells Mother Jones that in recent months he provided the bureau with memos, based on his recent interactions with Russian sources, contending the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trumpâ€”and that the FBI requested more information from him. 
According to the informant, the 'Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.' This aligns with what many intelligence experts in the U.S. have suspected, as well. Putin doesn't want Trump because he thinks he can work with him, he wants Trump because his presidency would tear American democracy apart at the seams. In the power vacuum that would ensue, Russia would then hope to capitalize on it geopolitically. Not a bad plan considering Trump has repeatedly demonstrated he is a moron when it comes to foreign policy. 
Unlike Clinton, however. The FBI has clearly taken pains to keep this investigation out of the public eye. In a sardonic twist, they even cite privacy as the reason why they can't comment, leading Democratic congressman Adam Schiff to note : 
'Any specifics of what the FBI or intelligence agencies may be looking at are not something that the bureau should be discussing publicly,' Schiff said. 'But here, where the director has discussed an investigation involving one candidate, it opens the director up to claims of bias if he doesn't discuss other potential investigations.' 
Meanwhile, Trump appears content to flaunt his love affair with Russia. On the very same day that Reid unloaded on him, the Republican candidate told a rally that he planned to work closely with Putin. Trump: "Wouldn't it be nice? Wouldn't it be smart?" To 'put everything together with Putin" and Russia?

Police say they have caught the man they believe shot two Iowa police officers dead in what is being described as an 'ambush-style' attack. 
The man behind the shooting is reportedly Scott Michael Greene, a 46-year-old Urbandale resident with a history of run-ins with the law, Confederate flag fetishism, and anger towards African Americans. He also has a recent obsession with Donald Trump. 
In a video allegedly posted by Greene and discovered by Buzzfeed , the soon-to-be cop killer records himself having an altercation with police officers on October 14. In a comment below the video, he says: 
'I was offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem. Thousands more whites fought and died for their freedom. However this is not about the Armed forces, they are cop haters.' 
Ironically, the video mostly featured Greene yelling at various cops about his rights while they try to escort him from a high school property. A selfie taken at the game shows why witnesses found Greene to be disturbing the peace. Greene decided to bring his Confederate flag to the stands with him. 
Naturally, Greene's neighbors say he came out hard for Trump several weeks ago, even placing a large Trump/Pence 2016 sign in his yard. Neighbor tells me that shooting suspect Scott Michael Greene put this Trump sign in his yard approx 2 weeks ago. pic.twitter.com/8HjtthB51I

Not exactly a surprising development considering the Republican candidates uncanny ability to collect endorsements from neo-Nazis, KKK leaders, and other hate groups. Also not surprising: The typically loud-mouthed Trump has been dead silent about the fact that his own supporter is allegedly involved in the execution of two police officers. Ditto for many of the same Republicans who rushed to baselessly blame Hillary Clinton and President Obama of inciting violence against cops every time they can. 
Iowa's own Rep. Steve King (R) had this inflammatory remark to say just after the Dallas police shooting: #DallasPoliceShooting has roots in first of anti-white/cop events illuminated by Obamaâ€¦Officer Crowley. There were others.

November 2, 2016 Alabama Republican Official: 'Just Because You Turned 18 Doesn't Give You The Right To Vote' (VIDEO)   
Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill has a big problem with increasing the number of registered voters in his state. 
Slate reports that Merrill, like many Republicans, opposes recent reforms in voter registration policies that could significantly increase the number of registered voters. 
The proposal would automatically register eligible state residents 'who interact with government agencies' to vote. According to the Brennan Center , this legislation would also guarantee that voter-registration information is moved on to election officials electronically, which will reduce errors in the voting process. 
However, Merrill says that he stands opposed to this initiative because it 'cheapen[s] the work' of civil rights activists, adding that 'just because you turned 18 doesn't give you the right [to vote].' 
'These people fought, some of them were beaten, some of them were killed because of their desire to ensure that everybody that wanted to had the right to register to vote and participate in the process,' Merrill explained in an interview with the voting rights initiative, Answering the Call . 
He then went on to reference several civil rights leaders, like Georgia U.S. Rep. John Lewis, who Merrill claimed called him a friend. 
Merrill continued, 'I'm not going to embarrass them by allowing someone that's too sorry to get up off of their rear end to go register to vote â€¦ because they think they deserve the right because they turned 18.' 
The jackass then went on to say that automatically registering teen voters to be able to exercise their right to vote is 'no different than giving them a trophy because they played on the ball team. You only get a trophy if you win!' 
'I think it's a sorry, lazy way out and it shows no initiative.' 
Alabama joins 14 other states who have enacted new voting restrictions ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The Brennan Center says that these actions are designed to 'curtail voting rights.' 
The New York Times reported last year that the restrictions Alabama put in place included a photo ID law, which makes having a government issued ID mandatory to participate in the voting process. 
The biggest problem with these identification laws is that many older and poorer citizens are faced with hardships when it comes to obtaining the necessary paperwork needed to get a government I.D. Many states also structure the office hours of their DMV services and polling locations to discourage people further from voting. 
The bottom line is that Republicans love low voter turn out because they can't convince the vast majority of Americans that their ideas are good for the country.

By Jameson Parker Election 2016 , Politics November 2, 2016 Trump Says His Favorite Book Is No Longer The Bible â€“ His NEW Favorite Book Proves He's A Narcissist   
In August of 2015, while trying desperately to convince Evangelical Christians that he would be a better choice for president than the laundry list of other potential Republican candidates, Donald Trump made the outrageous claim that his favorite book was the Bible . He even placed his own book just behind it. '[The Art of the Deal] is my second favorite book of all time,' said Trump. 'Do you know what my first is? The Bible! Nothing beats the Bible,' he added to applause. 
The feigned adoration for the Christian holy book was undone by the fact that Trump had quite literally never shown an interest in religion prior to that moment, couldn't name a single New Testament passage when pressed, and years earlier once remarked that he didn't believe adultery â€“ one of the Ten Commandments â€“ was a sin. 
Now that Trump is the nominee and Christian conservatives have stood by him despite his disgusting hate campaign and torrent of sexual assault allegations, he's apparently feeling a bit more confident. He doesn't need to fake it anymore. It was fun while it lasted! 
When asked by Extra 's A.J. Calloway what his favorite books were, Trump seemingly forgot that 'nothing beats the Bible.' He put his own books back on top. When given a 'rapid fire' quiz about his two favorite books, without hesitation Trump went with 'The Art of the Deal' and 'Surviving at the Top,' both of which were written by ghostwriters but with Trump getting a byline. 
It's particularly interesting that Trump with 'The Art of the Deal,' considering the man responsible for writing it has since disavowed Trump and now acts as his biggest critic . 
'I put lipstick on a pig,' he said. 'I feel a deep sense of remorse that I contributed to presenting Trump in a way that brought him wider attention and made him more appealing than he is.' He went on, 'I genuinely believe that if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization.' 
As with every answer Trump gives off-the-cuff, this one is very revealing. Here is a man so caught up in worshiping himself that when asked what his favorite book is he can only think of the ones with his own name on the covers. It really does say everything about his personality.

This election is causing millions of Americans a lot of stress. However, some are cracking under pressure more than most. 
Take for example Fox News' Sean Hannity, who last week decided to express himself in some weird variant of 'Palin-speak' over something to do with Josh Ernest, President Obama,'DT,' the 'liberal media,' Canada, and finally Kenya. Image via Mediaite . 
Mediaite used its team of scientist to try and decipher this strange message that many theorize (actually probably just me) may have originated from an ancient extra-terrestrial right-wing alien entity. 
'Hey, liberal media. It was White House press secretary Josh Earnest who refused to answer the question: will Obama stay in the US if Donald Trump wins? I said I'd pay a charter to any country they chose . I mentioned Canada, where the satire piece was written , and Kenya, where he once visited. Also, I am in need of serious professional help.' 
By the way, the link that Hannity sent belongs to a site run by professional alt-right Twitter troll, Chuck Johnson, who was suspended from Twitter in May for threatening a civil rights activist. 
Since then Hannity has unfortunately deleted the gloriously 'drunken tweet' in question. 
However, that didn't stop the heartless, ruthless bastards on Twitter from trolling poor Hannity like there was no tomorrow. He's been possessed by Sarah Palin! https://t.co/k7N06DWfQK

If there's one thing that's been missing during this bizarre 2016 election cycle, it's former Daily Show host Jon Stewart. That's not to say that his replacement, Trevor Noah, hasn't done a good job, but there's nothing like watching Stewart's magical brilliance. 
However, Stewart hasn't completely stayed out of election talk; after all, he appeared on The Late Show with his friend and partner in crime Stephen Colbert. On Tuesday night, Stewart left us with another comedic treat â€“ and of course the target of his relentless mockery was GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. 
At the 'Stand Up for Heroes Benefit' in New York City's Madison Square Garden, Stewart wasted no time in lighting into Trump. He began: 
'I'm not as much of a political analyst. But if I could ask you a question that I've been saying to my television, it's 'What the fuck? What the fuck is going on? What is happening?!'' 
Stewart then went on to recall a Twitter war Trump started with him, complete with Trumpian anti-Semitic dog whistles, in which Trump called Stewart 'Jonathan Leibowitz' and said that he needs to be 'proud of his heritage.' Of course, Stewart trolled Trump harder than Trump could ever troll him, saying: 
'So I start to think to myself, Oh, I think this guy is trying to let people know I'm a Jew. And I think to myself, doesn't my face do that? Honestly, like, where have you seen this face other than a poster for Yentl ? In what world are people like, Stewart, that's a Scottish name, but there's something about that fella that looks a little schmeary. It would be funny if it wasn't so toxically fucking crude and horrible, but. So I decide to tweet back at him, 'Many people don't know this, but Donald Trump's real name is Fuckface Von Clownstick. I wish you would embrace the Von Clownstick heritage.' 
This is just TOO GOOD. Hopefully, Trump has a complete meltdown over this one; after all, we know how thin Trump's skin is, and he won't be able to resist responding.

But Anderson didn't let her finish that statement and gave her a dose of truth that she won't soon forget.

Donald Trump is desperate, so he propped his supermodel wife up on stage again and made her give another campaign speech. Apparently, he learned nothing from the last time. Not only did Melania Trump plagiarize her speech again , this time borrowing the words of Donald's second wife, Marla Maples, but she also seemed to forget who the heck she is married to. 
Speaking to the crowd at a campaign rally in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, Melania expanded on her plan to fight online bullying as First Lady. 
'I will be an advocate for women and for children,' she said. 'Children and teenagers can be fragile. They are hurt when they are made fun of or made to feel less in looks or intelligence.' 
She then said that many comments, which are 'mean and too rough,' come from people with 'no name hiding on the Internet.' 
'We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other,' she said. 
'We must come together together as Americans,' she added. 'We must treat each other with respect and kindness even when we disagree.' 
Ummm, lady, have you looked at the orange guy that put a ring on your finger? You have a child with him, so you have obviously met the man, right? How do you not seem to realize that you are married to the biggest cyber bully around? Do you not follow him on Twitter? Seriously, WTF? 
Melania needs to take a look at the list of almost 300 people, places, and things Donald has insulted on Twitter since he announced his candidacy.

The stakes were very high for Melania Trump's big campaign speech, the only one she's given since being very publicly mocked for stealing her best lines from the RNC from none other than First Lady Michelle Obama. Unfortunately for the Trump campaign, the pressure must have gotten to her. 
She plagiarized again. 
It took less than an hour for people to figure it out, but the source will have people scratching their heads for days. Melania, Trump's third wife, seems to have lifted portions of her speech from Marla Maples, Trump's second wife. 
While speaking about her experiences as an immigrant, Melania said 'America meant if you could dream it, you could become it.' 
Tablet Magazine writer Yair Rosenberg, simply put the line into Google and saw what came up. It was a direct quote from Marla Maples given to a magazine in the 90s. Melania just plagiarized Trump's second wife Marla Maples. Here's the only Google results for "if you could dream it, you could become it": pic.twitter.com/ALeHuSZqEm 
â€” (((Yair Rosenberg))) (@Yair_Rosenberg) November 3, 2016 
Is 'If you could dream it, you could become it' a cliche? Sure. Is it weird that Melania would say the exact same phrase that Marla had? Definitely. 
However, more damning is what else Rosenberg noticed. It's not just the one cliched line, it's that the entire section about parents/opportunities is a ripoff, just like it was by Michelle Obama https://t.co/IK15IXH7As 
â€” (((Yair Rosenberg))) (@Yair_Rosenberg) November 3, 2016 
It's as if Melania typed what she wanted to say into Google, found the interview by Marla Maples, and simply made it her speech . 
Educator and speechwriter Yoni Brander pointed out that the odd butchering of the truism 'If you can dream it, you can be it' suggests Melania really did lift the section directly from Marla â€“ the only other person on record as having screwed it up that way. 3. can dream it, you can become it." by William A. Ward. But the form used byMelania which cuts the beginning of the quote and changes 
â€” yoni brander (@yonibrander) November 3, 2016 4. changes the tense to "if you dream it, you could become it' a variant that appears in only in one other place- Marla Maples interview 
â€” yoni brander (@yonibrander) November 3, 2016 
It is also in line with how Melania says she screwed up her RNC speech. She told reporters at the time that she accidentally plagiarized by harmlessly finding passages from other people that spoke to her and using them as her starting point. One of those passages, Michelle Obama's speech, made its way into the final draft. In the same way, it appears Melania plagiarized her husband's ex-wife. 
To which one must conclude that Trump's camp is run by an staggering assortment of incompetent buffoons. To screw up one major speech is a goof, to screw up two in a rowâ€¦ that's a level of idiocy that is difficult to wrap one's head around. And while Melania needs to stop using Google to write her speeches, Trump's campaign needs to spend five minutes making sure she doesn't steal lines from the candidate's ex-wife. It's not rocket science.

A leaked passage from Megyn Kelly's new book reveals that her perverted boss, Roger Ailes, offered to advance the Fox host's career in exchange for 'sexual favors.' 
Kelly's book, titled Settle For More , is set to be released on November 15. In the book, she reportedly reveals that Ailes targeted her as well as many of the other women at Fox News. The harassment took place early on during Kelly's time at Fox News, beginning in 2005. The managing editor came to her and told her that she had 'captured the attention of Mr. Ailes.' She would soon learn just what this meant during the first of several meetings at his office in Manhattan. 
'Roger began pushing the limits,' she alleges. 'There was a pattern to his behavior. I would be called into Roger's office, he would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with me â€” veering between obviously inappropriate sexually charged comments (e.g. about the 'very sexy bras' I must have and how he'd like to see me in them) and legitimate professional advice.' 
But things didn't stop there. Radar reports : 
'He offered to advance her career 'in exchange for sexual favors,' she writes, and even though she says she rejected 'every single one,' she claims he tried 'physical advances.'' 
'But in January 2006, she claims, he 'crossed a new line â€” trying to grab me repeatedly and kiss me on the lips.' When she shoved him away, she alleges, 'he asked me an ominous question: 'When is your contract up?' And then, for the third time, he tried to kiss me.' ' 
Kelly stayed conspicuously quiet when former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson came forward and filed a lawsuit against Ailes accusing him of sexual harassment. In her book, Kelly says that Ailes launched an 'intense campaign' to convince her to speak out on his behalf when Carlson first filed her claim against him. 
'I was approached several times, and several times I refused,' she writes. 'There was no way I was going to lie to protect him.' 
The revelation confirms what most of us already assumed. After all, it wasn't likely that a dirty old man like Ailes would go after so many other women at the network and not target the pretty young starlet. Until now, though, this had not been confirmed by Kelly. She said in her book that she finally decided it was time to speak out, even though there could be serious consequences. 
'Crossing him was a major risk,' she said, 'but what if â€” God forbid â€” he was still doing it to someone?' 
The passages regarding Ailes were reportedly added to the book after the rest of it had been completed. The book's publisher is HarperCollins, which is owned by the same media company as Fox, who fired Ailes after Carlson filed suit against him. 
Radar also noted that Kelly has stressed 'that though she rebuffed all of his advances, he [Ailes] never went through with his implied threat of revenge. Instead, he promoted her.'

Just one week before America decides whether or not to elect Donald Trump, one of his supporters decided to help get his message out by torching a black church and defacing its wall with the words 'Vote Trump.' 
'When firefighters arrived at Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church Tuesday night, they found it in flames, and the Vote Trump slogan written in silver spray paint on the outside wall of the church,' Mark Rigsby of Mississippi Public Broadcasting reports. 
'Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons calls this a hate crime â€” an attempt to frighten voters just days before the presidential election.' 
Trump has yet to condemn the attack, or even mention it. 
Mississippi has been the host of many decades of violence directed at African Americans. During the Jim Crow era, acts of terror committed against black Mississippians was disturbingly common. It seems for at least one Trump supporter, the term 'Make American Great Again' means returning to that dark time. 
But rather than let this disgusting display of intolerance be the story, Americans got to work. In just hours, a verified GoFundMe account was set up by concerned citizens and thousands of dollars began to pour in to help rebuild. 
It's goal was to raise $10,000. It likely wouldn't be enough to repair all of the damages inside and outside of the church, but it would be a start. Instead, people gave over $150,000. And perhaps even more remarkably, the entire world appeared ready to reject the deplorable racism and bigotry that led to this act. The campaign's organizer updated the campaign by saying that people from all faiths (and none at all) and many countries have contributed: 
Responses have been pouring in from all over the world, and they're truly extraordinary. Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, atheists and many more, from all over the United States and many other countries. 
And according to GoFundMe's VP of Communications and Policy Dan Pfeiffer, this campaign is perhaps the fastest growing in the history of the site. This one right here is verified and one of our fastest growing history https://t.co/E4smWW2s7d https://t.co/xIQWY4ulsV

A slogan that has often been used to counter Trump's message of cynical bigotry comes to mind: Love trumps hate.

On Tuesday, an election volunteer was injured at a polling location at Collin College in Plano, TX when he was sliced by box-cutter blades intentionally planted in a Trump/Pence sign. 
Collin College spokeswoman Lisa Vasquez said in a statement: 
'The man stopped as he left the campus to help re-position the sign to the correct location because it was blocking the official polling site sign. When he did so, box-cutter blades attached to the Trump-Pence sign cut his hands.' 
Steve Spainhouer, Collin County Democratic Campaign Chair, told reporters at KTVT that the incident was 'deplorable.' 
'It just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody who's probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other. 
I think most people have already made their minds up at this point how they're going to vote and so there's nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful.' 
Thankfully, the injured poll worker was not seriously hurt, but this could have been much worse. Clearly, the people who did this have listened to Trump's violent rhetoric â€” they knew putting a razor blade in a misplaced sign was dangerous. And in placing the sign in the wrong place, they deliberately injured someone. 
Texas Rangers are investigating the incident. Let's hope they find the people/person who did this.

Anthony Weiner's Alleged Teenaged Sexting Victim Pens SCATHING Open Letter To FBI Director Comey 786 Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
With just a little over a week to go before election day, FBI Director James Comey took it upon himself to blatantly interfere with the process. 
During a probe into Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal, the FBI supposedly uncovered emails that may or may not (probably not) have something to do with Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, for which she has already been exonerated. Comey sent a vague letter to congress which he KNEW would start a shit-storm in the media, and now the race is closer than ever. And here Trump complains about a 'rigged' election! 
Unfortunately, while attempting to sway voters, Comey didn't consider that there was someone else at the center of this â€” Anthony Weiner's victim, who is only 16 years old. 
She was understandably upset and had a few words to say to the FBI director. You can read the entire letter on BuzzFeed , but here are a few excerpts: 
I am the 15-year-old (now 16) who was the victim of Anthony Weiner. I now add you to the list of people who have victimized me. I told my story originally to protect other young girls that might be a victim of online predators. 
Your letter to Congress has now brought this whole matter back into the media spotlight. Not even 10 minutes after being forensically interviewed with the FBI for seven hours, I received a phone call from a REPORTER asking for a statement. Why didn't you communicate with the local FBI agents that I had just spoken to? They could have scheduled our interview sooner or scheduled a time to interview me later, or change locations of the interview. My neighborhood has been canvassed by reporters asking for details about me. 
â€¦ 
I thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me. I thought if I cooperated with your investigation, my identity as a minor would be kept secret. That is no longer the case. My family and I are barraged by reporters' phone calls and emails. I have been even been blamed in a newspaper for causing Donald Trump to now be leading in some polls and costing Hillary the election. 
Anthony Weiner is the abuser. Your letter helped that abuse to continue. How can I rebuild my life when you have made finding out my 'story' the goal of every reporter? 
She signs the letter with, 'Girl that lost faith in America.' 
And that coming from a girl who is barely starting her life, but who is also approaching voting age is heartbreaking.

Donald Trump's merry band of supporters are surely not known for being the brightest crayons in the box. If anything, they tend to be a dull gray. The GOP nominee himself has even bragged about his loyal following of 'poorly educated' dumbasses from across the country. His most fervent backers tend to have shoe sizes with larger numbers than their IQs. 
However, what Trump's followers are known for is their tendency to plan for retaliation if Hillary Clinton wins the presidential election on Tuesday. They have promised a civil war and bloodshed if Trump loses, which they are convinced could only happen if the election is rigged. When you combine these two traits, a penchant for violence and good old-fashioned stupidity, the result can sometimes be terrifying. Other times, it can be downright laughable. 
This would be a prime example of the latter. 
Meet John. John vehemently supports Trump and his plan to 'Make America Great Again.' Fearing a Clinton presidency, he has decided that if she wins the White House, he will have no choice to engage in an act of 'civil disobedience.' You know, to show the government that he means business and all. Consequently, this brilliant man has managed to come up with the dumbest act of 'civil disobedience' ever. 
So just what does John the genius plan to do? He's going to block the drive-thru at McDonald's. After all, this is where all the illegal immigrants are working. That's it. That's his scheme in its entirety. Blocking the drive-thru at McDonald's. Because, that'll show 'em, dammit! John, 67, says if Trump loses he'll do civil disobedience like blocking the drive-thru of McDonald's where illegal immigrants work. pic.twitter.com/pESFnD83E2

Trump supporters certainly don't represent the best and brightest that America has to offer. But despite the fact that the majority of them are idiots, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to fill out a ballot. These people will be voting. The only way to keep these racist morons from deciding the fate of the country is for Democrats to turn out in droves on Tuesday and defeat Trump in a landslideâ€¦even if it does mean that grabbing breakfast at McDonald's may take a little longer than usual on Nov. 9 due to a crazy guy blocking the drive-thru.

By April Hamlin Election 2016 , Miscellaneous , News , Politics , Videos November 4, 2016 Obama Had The Best Reaction To A Protester Ever, So Trump Lies And Says He Did The Exact Opposite   
President Obama was interrupted by a protester while he was speaking at a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton. Suffice it to say, Obama had the best reaction to a protester ever. Hands down. So, of course, Trump had to start lying about what happened. 
Speaking to a crowd in Hershey, PA, Trump said that the president had done quite literally the exact opposite of what he actually did . 
'You saw it today on television, right? He was talking to the protester, screaming at him, really screaming at him. By the way, if I spoke the way Obama spoke to that protester, they would say, 'He became unhinged! He became â€“'You have to go back and look and study. And see what happened. They never moved the camera. And he spent so much time screaming at this protester and frankly, it was a disgrace.' 
Okay, so let's 'go back and look' at just how President Obama handled the situation today. When the protester interrupted him, the crowd was not having it. He struggled to quiet them as they chanted 'Hillary,' and when he succeeded, he began by reminding them of all the reasons they should treat this man with respect. Obama defended the protester's First Amendment rights and then told those in attendance that this is what he means when he says they aren't 'focused.' He concluded with his now trademark phrase, 'Don't boo, VOTE!'

In what may be the last bombshell to drop prior to Election Day, the Associated Press is now reporting that they have found the smoking gun that proves Melania Trump worked illegally in the United States prior to obtaining a work visa. 
This means: For all intents and purposes, Melania was the sort of 'illegal' immigrant that her husband now labels as criminals and morally-bankrupt. The Trump family lied about this fact and conspired to cover it up for the duration of the election. This comes at a supremely bad time for Trump, who recently made Melania a campaign centerpiece â€“ including a much publicized speech onâ€¦ you guessed itâ€¦ immigration. 
Here's what the AP found : 
The documents obtained by the AP show she was paid for 10 modeling assignments between Sept. 10 and Oct. 15, during a time when her visa allowed her generally to be in the U.S. and look for work but not perform paid work in the country. The documents examined by the AP indicate that the modeling assignments would have been outside the bounds of her visa. 
It is highly unlikely that the discovery will affect the citizenship status of Mrs. Trump. The government can seek to revoke the U.S. citizenship of immigrants after the fact in cases when it determines a person willfully misrepresented or concealed facts relevant to his naturalization. But the government effectively does this in only the most egregious cases, such as instances involving terrorism or war crimes. 
According to the documents, Melania made roughly $20,000 illegally before getting her visa â€“ only slightly less money in seven weeks than the average undocumented worker Trump disparages as 'moochers' make in a year . 
While existing standards mean Melania would likely remain a U.S. citizen despite her previous violations, her husband's plans to crack down on illegal immigration might be working against her. Trump has long held that people who 'cheated' to get into the United States illegally should be moved to the 'back of the line.' Would he include his wife in that sweeping category? 
Of course, Melania Trump should not be deported over a technicality in her early immigration status. However, her husband might want to think about that fact when he screams at rallies about rounding up families of Hispanic immigrants and shipping them out of the country. Melania is living proof that the immigration issue in this country isn't exactly cut-and-dry. Not that Trump is known for any semblance of nuance.

A casting call obtained by Fox News on Wednesday was apparently sent out by an 'up-and-coming conservative media network currently in development.' 
According to the casting call, the upstart network is searching the U.S. for hosts, reporters, and right-wing well-spoken contributors. 
The notice stresses that on-air talent 'must be knowledgeable about conservative viewpoints, current events, and the presidential election,' adding applicants must also 'look upscale and intelligent,' and should be 'outspoken and energetic.' 
The network is holding auditions at a secret New York City studio on November 7, just before election day. 
And while the casting call does not disclose the identity of the mystery employer, it does suggest that the network's first programming will be streamed online. Coincidentally, the Trump campaign has just set up it's online Facebook live feed, where his aides have been broadcasting Trump events and counter news programming. 
Vanity Fair was the first to report in June that Trump was thinking about starting his own media network. 
In September, the Financial Times reported that Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner started making inquiries into launching a new media company after the election to capitalize on his father-in-law's political movement. 
However, Trump has openly dismissed the idea, and told the Washington Post last month: 
'I want to win the presidency, and I want to make America great again. It's very simple. I have no interest in a media company.' 
Wouldn't it be funny if one of his kids just so happened to start a media company after the election? 
Or perhaps Donald Trump just does it under his name, after all, it's not as if he's ever had a problem with lying, especially when it comes to business.

November 4, 2016 College Classmate Reveals HORRIFIC Story Of Time Trump Hit His Son In The Face Inside Their Dorm   
Scott Melker is a Miami-based DJ who reportedly attended the University of Pennsylvania at the same time as one of the sons of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. 
Melker recently shared a disturbing story on Facebook in which he claims that Trump very casually physically assaulted Donald Trump Jr. in front of his classmates, as well as the troubling behaviors of Don Jr., who he described as 'a drunk' who earned the nickname 'Diaper Don.' Image via Facebook 
Before we get ahead of ourselves, we should, of course, take it for what it is worth. This is just one man's account, and for all we know, Melker could have made the whole thing up. But Melker's account doesn't come across as exaggerated, the alleged interaction, while disturbing, seems very understated. 
And here's what we do know about Trump. 
He has bragged on video about how he felt his 'star' status gave him permission to routinely sexually assault random women by kissing them and grabbing their genitalia against their will. 
Trump has also been accused of committing numerous sexual assaults against women, including raping two young teenage girls. 
And according to his first wife, Trump did not have the best of relationships with his three oldest children. During a benefit a few weeks ago, Ivana Trump told the crowd that she 'brought up the children singlehandedly. Donald wasn't really interested in children until he could talk business with them.' 
With so many deep character flaws, it's not exactly a stretch of the imagination that he would physically lash out as well. 
If this story turns out to be true, it could explain a lot about why Trump's two oldest sons are the way they are, and it could foretell a very troubling future for Trump's youngest son Barron, who is only 10 years old.

By Jameson Parker Election 2016 , Politicians Behaving Badly , Politics November 4, 2016 'Is He Having A Stroke?': Huckabee Calls Trump A 'Car Wreck,' Freaks Out When People Laugh At Him   
It was a good morning for Ben Carson. No longer can it be said that he is Donald Trump's very worst campaign surrogate. The title now belongs to Mike Huckabee â€“ a very dim bulb in a low wattage room. 
In a turn that had people seriously questioning his mental health, the former Arkansas governor decided to use his patented ability to make lousy metaphors to compare Donald Trump to a car wreck. A strong endorsement if there ever was one. Trump may be a car wreck, but at least his car is pointed in right direction. Hillary is a drunk-driver going the wrong way on the freeway. 
â€” Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) November 4, 2016 
To break down the comparison, Huckabee is saying Donald Trump may be dead on arrival, but at least he isn't Hillary Clinton, a woman he thinks is taking the country in the wrong direction. In Huckabee's tortured brain, the fact that his own candidate is a total mess â€“ the one he plans on voting for and is enthusiastically flying around the country supporting â€“ is less bad than a woman who would back liberal policies he disagrees with. Soâ€¦ vote for Donald Trump, the car wreck! 
Hilariously, Huckabee seemed legitimately shocked and outraged that people took his analogy to mean he thought Donald Trump was a bad candidate. But instead of clarifying, Huckabee's follow-up made everything so much worse. Low IQ media don't get my earlier tweet about car wreck. @realdonaldTrump will bend fenders but is a vehicle going right way.

By Allison Vincent Election 2016 , News , Politics , Right-Wing Terrorism , Videos November 4, 2016 Seth Meyers Takes 'A Closer Look' At The GOP's Threats Against Hillary And It's Terrifying! (VIDEO)   
There are only a few days left in this election and Republicans are growing more and more desperate, using what Seth Meyers called 'increasingly unhinged rhetoric' during Thursday's Late Night segment of A Closer Look. 
''Republicans are using increasingly unhinged rhetoric to warn about the consequences of electing Hillary,' Meyers said. 'Many are even threatening to impeach her without any evidence of a crime before she ever takes office and if they can't do that, they'll settle for the next best thing â€“ preventing her from filling any vacancy on the Supreme Court for her entire four year term.'' 
But that's not all they've done â€” there have also been more death threats and calls to violence. Former Congressman Joe Walsh, who, like Donald Trump, enjoys Twitter WAY more than he should, tweeted this on November 1: 
Another shocking GOP turn is from Ted Cruz, who just a few short months ago, during his speech at the RNC, refused to endorse Trump, but just today he hopped on Trump's plane to go campaign for him in Iowa. This, after Trump accused Cruz's father of killing JFK and also said horrible things about his wife. Remember that 'baked bean teeth' comment Trump made? Yeah. Just plain nasty. 
It's really unfortunate that Cruz caved, but the GOP is so terrified of losing control, that they are willing to forget their own pride and pull out all the stops to keep Clinton out of office. 
Watch Seth Meyers break it all down. It's pretty terrifying.

Donald Trump Jr. followed suit, telling his followers on Twitter that his father had almost been assassinated. He offered zero evidence. 
And, in fact, absolutely none of those details were true. The protester which is believed to have incited the panic was not trying to harm Donald Trump, not carrying a gun, and wasn't even a Hillary supporter . He was a Republican protesting Trump. 
Reporters tracked down the man, who says he was holding a sign and was attacked by Trump supporters after someone said he had a gun. This is the man who was ejected from the rally, sparking panic. He was holding a sign: "Republicans Against Trump" pic.twitter.com/bZ2JAZ2w88

The Secret Service clarified what happened, and while their actions were understandable given the circumstances, the idea that the Trump campaign could leap from the small amount of details to a full-blown Hillary conspiracy is idiotic and reckless.

â€” Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) November 6, 2016 
Talking Points Memo's Josh Marshall hit the nail on the head. This rush to exploit a non-story by Trump's campaign is cynical and disturbing. It also led to Trump's fired up mob seeking to avenge their candidate by attacking reporters â€“ a group Trump has repeatedly demonized. 4: Clinton supporter. When a CNN reporter went into the crowd to try to learn more he was assaulted by feral Trumpers still amped up â€¦ 
â€” Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) November 6, 2016 
There is something cultish about the way Trump's campaign relished the idea that someone would attempt to hurt their candidate. The minor detail that none of it was true didn't seem to slow them down. They want to portray Trump as a martyr without any of the inconvenience of an actual martyrdom.

'Where's Lee Harvey Oswald when we need him?' 
These were the disgusting words caught on video at a Republican rally in southern Wisconsin Saturday. The not-so-subtle assassination suggestion was bellowed off camera near the front, while Paul Ryan was up on stage. The GOP congressman was well within earshot of the utterance, yet he continued babbling about Clinton scandals without standing up to the despicable crowd. That's right, the Speaker of the U.S. House, 'Mr. Speaker' to you and me, said nothing. 
This isn't the first time someone at a Trump rally blatantly suggested Hillary be assassinated, of course.The Donald himself suggested ' Second Amendment people ' might be able to do something about her if she were elected at a rally in August. After the shocking statement, Paul Ryan remarked to reporters the comment sounded, 'like a joke gone bad.' Perhaps, Ryan thought this Trumpkin was joking, too. 
There are other possible explanations for his lack of reaction. Perhaps he didn't hear the scream. He is the Republican House speaker after all, he's used to ignoring people. Less likely, perhaps he doesn't know who Lee Harvey Oswald is and therefor didn't understand the reference. Or maybe he's a fan of Oliver Stone's film JFK and agrees that Oswald was just a 'patsy.' Being a Trump patsy himself, he might of merely assumed the deplorable was shouting support for him. 
Or maybe, and most probably, he heard it, he got it and just didn't care. Afraid to stand up to Trump's mob. 
Watch the video and decide for yourself: 
No matter what the reason for such an offensive lack of response, we can all agree it is time for Paul Ryan to step down, and not just from the stage.

There are two fundamental truths in this world: Paul Ryan desperately wants to be president. And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. 
In a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : 'Republicans, it is time to come home' https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I

The Democratic Party couldn't have asked for a better moment of film. Ryan's chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryan's career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. 
The ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a 'principled' conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trump's unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan â€“ like many of his colleagues â€“ turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. 
What's especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didn't exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up. 
If 2016's very ugly election has done any good it's by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him. What a turn of events.

So much for the media narrative that there is a so-called 'enthusiasm gap' between Clinton and Trump. Watching a Florida crowd roar as Hillary Clinton delivers a powerful speech in a downpour shows just how seriously people are taking this election. Clinton voters are just as motivated for her as Trump's are for him, perhaps more so. 
Clinton was in Broward County, a crucial Democratic stronghold in what could be the deciding state of the election. The weather wouldn't cooperate , with intense rains off-and-on in the lead up to the event, but it didn't dissuade rally goers. By the time Hillary got up to the stage, the crowd was soaked but the atmosphere was electric. After a brief moment of sunshine, the rain returned in force. Hillary kept going.

The crowd was roaring. The mood was positive. It was everything that Donald Trump and his allies in the media claim you don't see at a Clinton rally. And it was in Florida, the state that could put Hillary over the top and the state that Trump must win to even have a hope of being elected. Watching Hillary's rally probably sent a chill down the spines of Trump's campaign staff. 
Hilariously, just yesterday, Trump got caught lying about the turnout of his own rally. According to his own account, 'thousands' of people were left outside of his rally because it was too packed. Reporters on the scene debunked this claim instantly. Trump says "thousands and thousands of people" are standing outside. I am outside. There are maybe 500 people. pic.twitter.com/qKRNQYqBid

This is not to say that Democrats can get complacent. In the closing weeks of the election, the polls have become disturbingly close. RealClearPolitics puts Clinton only 1 point ahead of Trump in Florida. It's clear that this race will be won or lost based on which side's supporters get to the voting booth. For Clinton, it's a good sign that Floridians are showing that they will come out for her rain or shine.

Bill Maher finally got his interview with President Obama and it's a must see! 
After hundreds of thousands of petition signatures and months of 'begging' on his show, Bill Maher finally managed to get President Obama to agree to a sit-down interview, and it aired on Real Time Friday night. 
During the interview, the two discussed a wide variety of subjects based on questions Maher compiled from what he thought his viewers 'would want to know,' including Socialism, global warming, the agriculture industry and the military. They also discussed elitism and religion. President Obama answered every question candidly and without hesitation. He even joked around with Maher when the subject of marijuana legalization came up. 
At the end of the interview, Maher brought up the election and the president had this to say to people who are still on the fence, or are choosing not to vote at all: 
'Anybody sitting on the sidelines right now, or deciding to engage in a protest vote â€” that's a vote for Trump, and that would be badly damaging to this country, and very damaging to the world. ' 
Bill Maher may have scored one of the most in-depth interviews with President Obama ever, and you won't want to miss it.

J.J. Holmes has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. He and his mother, Alison Holmes, attended a Trump rally on Saturday to protest the GOP nominee's mockery of people with disabilities. As they were being removed from the rally by security, Trump's supporters began pushing and kicking the child's wheelchair. 
'The crowd started chanting 'U-S-A' and pushing his wheelchair,' Alison said. 'We were put out by security. Mr. Trump kept saying, 'Get them out.'' 
'I hate Donald Trump. I hate Donald Trump,' J.J. said through his vocalization device. 
The next day, J.J. and his mom got to meet the President of the United States after a rally for Hillary Clinton in Kissimmee, Florida. The experience was the polar opposite of what they had experienced the day before.

Here we are, on the cusp of what is most definitely the most important presidential election of our lifetimes. There's a lot on the line that goes far beyond politics. It goes into the character of the candidates, and their fitness for office. In GOP nominee Donald Trump, we have an unstable reality star who is dangerously unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and nothing more than a bigoted demagogue who has managed to fleece half the nation into believing his authoritarian ways will solve all their problems. 
On the other hand, we have Hillary Clinton taking up the mantle for the Democrats. She will take the nation forward into a brighter future, reassure and protect our allies, and continue the social and economic progress that President Obama has done so much for. We're talking about a woman who has been First Lady, a United States Senator, and Secretary of State. She performed admirably in all of those roles. 
And now, at the end of what has been a bruising, ugly campaign thanks to the dangerous rhetoric of one Donald J. Trump, we have forgotten one thing: We are witnessing history. Hillary is the first woman to shatter the glass ceiling to become the nominee of one of America's two major parties. It's easy to lose sight of all of that in such a crazy election season, but we have much to celebrate. 
Luckily, Hillary's campaign didn't lose sight of that, and they released an amazingly inspiring video that chronicled her meteoric rise to the Democratic Party's nomination for President. It goes from the announcement, through the primaries, and through the ridiculousness of having to run against Donald Trump. And here we are, waiting with bated breath on the eve of this stressful election, and Hillary has given us the priceless gift of something to celebrate in a world that feels quite bleak right now. Without further ado, here it is, The Story of Us, via Hillary's Twitter: The story of this campaign. pic.twitter.com/8cft9HD0RI 
â€” Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 5, 2016 
So, take a deep breath, watch that amazing video, and remember â€“ VOTE BLUE. 
Here's to you, Hillary, and hopefully, in two days we'll be calling you what you've been destined to be called your whole life: MADAME PRESIDENT.

On Sunday, President Barack Obama was on the campaign trail stumping for Hillary Clinton in Florida when he started brutally mocking Donald Trump upon learning that his campaign may have taken away his Twitter account in the final days leading up to the election. 
The president couldn't help himself; he just had to go after the man who he characterized as being too immature to step into his job. 
'Apparently his campaign has taken away his Twitter,' Obama said during a Florida rally for Hillary Clinton , to laughs. 
The president then used humor to make a point to remind everyone of just what was at stake in this election. 'In the last two days, they had so little confidence in his self control, they said: 'We're just going to take away your Twitter.' Now, if somebody cant handle a Twitter account, they can't handle the nuclear code,' Obama continued. 'If somebody starts tweeting at three in the morning because SNL made fun of you, then you can't handle the nuclear codes.' 
On Sunday, the New York Times reported that Trump no longer controls his Twitter account. Instead, the Republican nominee appears to have aides creating 'Trump safe' messages on his behalf while he focuses his energy on whining and lying at his live rallies. 
During the rally in the battleground state of Florida, Obama labeled Trump as being 'uniquely unqualified' and 'temperamentally unfit' to serve as Commander-in-Chief. 'I've been in this office now almost eight years and here's what I can tell you,' Obama said. 'Who you are, what you are, does not change when you take office. It just magnifies who you are. It just shines a spotlight on who are you.' Every day there's another example of how much of a complete joke Trump's campaign has been over the past year. But as much as we would love to laugh at this clown, we must first make sure he doesn't get elected. Or else the joke's on us.

November 6, 2016 You Won't BELIEVE The Hilarious Reason We Haven't Seen Any Late Night Trump Twitter Rants Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
The press has been praising GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump lately for staying on message on the campaign trail and avoiding feuds on Twitter. After all, the entire campaign has been dogged by Trump's Twitter meltdowns â€“ especially in cases where he did outrageous things like spending a week attacking the parents of a fallen soldier, and fat-shaming a beauty queen in the middle of the night while urging his millions of followers to check out a sex tape. 
The world watched in horror as a major party presidential nominee engaged in this childish, bullying behavior, and as his advisers and surrogates toured the talk shows cleaning up his messes. However, it seems that here in the 11th hour of this crazy election cycle, Trump's campaign aides have had enough of his coming unglued online. So, as if they are babysitting a toddler, they've done the unthinkable and removed Trump's access to his own Twitter account . 
According to the New York Times, instead of allowing Trump to tweet when he feels like it, he and his aides craft careful tweets to send out to his millions of followers. The Times cites one instance where Hope Hicks, one of the campaign's spokespeople, helped Trump word a tweet chastising President Obama for stumping so much for Hillary. 
So, in other words, Trump has so little self-control that his social media has to be monitored like a child. He probably stomped, screamed, and ranted throughout Trump Tower when Kellyanne or whoever responsible for this decision took his phone away, but it seems that in the final days, the campaign knew that they'd have no time to clean up any messes Trump might create for himself via Twitter. Therefore, they had no choice but to treat him like the small child who just happens to be occupying a 70-year-old man's body that he is. 
And to think â€“ in two days, this little boy could be in control of the world's most powerful nuclear arsenal.

By now, we all know that the Secret Service had to rush GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump off the stage at a rally in Reno, Nevada on Saturday night. It turned out to be nothing â€“ just a protester with a sign. At the time it all looked pretty chaotic and frightening, but it turned out that Trump was just fine. The 'gun' turned out to be an anti-Trump poster. The man turned out to be a Republican who just wanted the opportunity to protest what Trump had done to his party with a 'Republicans against Trump' sign. There was no threat. 
Those facts don't matter to the Trump team, though, as campaign manager Kellyanne Conway went on CNN's State of the Union and insisted to host Jake Tapper that it was indeed a very real attempt on Trump's life. 
First, Tapper inquired as to why Trump's people were 'retweeting misinformation that this was an assassination attempt.' Conway responded: 
'It's scary. All the coverage is usually about our protesters wreaking havoc and making people feel afraid. And it certainly goes both ways. I'm with Mr. Trump and the Secret Service routinely. They do an amazing job. 
I also want to point out because some people are spreading misinformation about the protester. He had canvassed for Hillary Clinton and he had donated to her campaign. So, this is a Democratic plant or operative trying to disrupt our rally. And I think people saw a nimble resilient Donald Trump who would be nimble and resilient as president as well.' 
Tapper called Conway on her bullshit, though, and shot back: 
'Except it wasn't an assassination attempt. It was apparently a local voter, a Republican who says he is supporting Hillary Clinton. He has given money to Hillary Clinton. He has canvassed for Hillary Clinton. But he says he's a Republican. But most importantly, he was not trying to assassinate anyone.' 
This was not an assassination attempt, but why is your campaign spreading that it was?' 
Conway waffled, saying, 'That's really remarkable. That that's what the storyline is here.' 
Of course, she then did what Trumpkins backed into corners always do, and tried to start changing the subject to the imagined sins of Hillary Clinton. She insisted that the only reason Beyonce, Jay Z and other A-List stars were on the trail with Hillary was that nobody wanted to go to Hillary rallies. Finally, Conway said she'd consider changing the assassination lie if CNN went on the record against 'all the storylines, all the headlines, all the breathless predictions of the last two weeks that turned out not to be true.' 
Tapper said to that: 
'I never reported anything along those lines.' 
And irritable Conway insisted: 
'CNN certainly has. You've got to be honest here.' 
Tapper continued, 'We've been saying all along that Donald Trump has a path to the presidency.' 
Conway then interjected with her trademark 'WOW!' 
Tapper plowed on, though, and nailed the humiliation home, and actually laughed in her face, saying: 
'You can say 'wow' all you want, I've never said that the race was over. We can replay as many tapes as you want.' 
Tapper was right to hammer Conway like this. Trump's entire campaign has been one big con job, built upon fear, ignorance, bigotry, incompetence, and lies. It's about time someone called them out for what they really are.

Former comedian and current Senator Al Franken (D-MN) wasn't joking when he suggested that FBI Director James Comey answer to the Senate regarding his unprofessional behavior. 
On Sunday, Franken called for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold hearings concerning Comey's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private server and whether or not she compromised national security. 
The Minnesota senator also said he believes Clinton can count on his state's voters despite a last-minute campaign stop from Donald Trump, though the senator admitted that he's always 'nervous.' 
'I think that there should be hearings, and I'm certain there will be hearings in the Judiciary Committee on this matter,' the Franken told CNN's Jake Tapper on 'State of the Union.' 
Franken's remarks reflect growing Democratic anger with Comey after the director told lawmakers 11 days before Tuesday's presidential election that his agency was reviewing new emails that may or may not be connected to their previous investigation. 
Comey, who previously cleared Clinton of any criminal negligence, sent a vaguely worded letter to top Republicans that falsely gave the impression that the FBI was reopening the Clinton investigation. 
'Even more troubling is what we've heard from sort of the rogue elements of the FBI seemingly tipping off former (New York City) Mayor (Rudy) Giuliani that something was up. I mean, it just seems like â€” that's not the FBI,' Franken said. 
'We will have hearings. I'm sure that FBI Director Comey will be before us,' Franken said. 'I think he should be able to answer questions about this, and he should be able to control the FBI.' 
The senator also went to bat for the Clinton Foundation after Tapper questioned him on whether or not the organization should be shut down should Clinton win the election. However, the Minnesota lawmaker redirected his answer to address alleged illegal activities perpetrated by Donald Trump's foundation. 
'I think that sometimes people should compare the two foundations, the Trump Foundation and the Clinton Foundation â€” that the HIV drugs to millions of people vs. the Trump Foundation, which doesn't seem to have done much of anything for anybody other than Donald Trump,' Franken said. 
Franken also reassured viewers that he wasn't worried about which way his home state would vote in the election. 
Trump is scheduled to visit Minnesota, a state that has not voted for a Republican since 1972, as one of his last few campaign stops before Tuesday. 
When asked if he felt Clinton was in trouble there, Franken replied, 'I don't think so.' 
However, Franken admitted, 'I'm always nervous.' 
'We run through the finish line,' he said. 'This is what I tell everybody, I go to canvassing centers, I say, 'Many of you have jobs, many of you have families â€” ignore them. Get on the doors.'' 
Franken's nervousness is shared by millions of Americans who worry about the idiocy of some of their family, friends, and neighbors who seem hell-bent on handing the country over to Trump tiny slimy hands.

November 6, 2016 Greatest Basketball Player Of Our Era To Help First Woman President Beat Biggest Asshole Of All Time Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
He is perhaps the greatest basketball player of all time, certainly of the current era, and he's with her. 
Cleveland's LeBron James has announced that he will be stumping for Hillary when she makes a stop in the crucial city in one of the most hotly contested battleground states in the country. James and Clinton will appear together at a get-out-the-vote rally at the Public Auditorium in Cleveland, Ohio in the late afternoon. This will be James's first appearance with Clinton. In fact, a source says, the two have never met. James â€“ a hero to many Ohio sports fans, especially in the African American community â€“ could prove helpful to Clinton's effort to win the state's 18 electoral votes. While Clinton is handily beating Donald Trump among African American voters, she is struggling to gin up enthusiasm. According to the 2010 census, 53 percent of Clevelanders are African American. 
The stakes could not be higher. If Clinton can win Ohio, there is almost no scenario in which Trump can win. If Ohio goes for Trump, then he has a real shot of becoming president. As Ohio's biggest star (sorry, John Kasich), James has a lot of power to motivate people to get out and vote. It could be a difference-maker in a tight election. 
James' decision to stump with Hillary comes after other big-name celebrities publicly expressed their support for her campaign. Just days ago, musical power couple Beyonce and Jay Z held a concert in support of Clinton. The star power has spooked Trump's campaign, as evidenced by the fact that they are claiming the celebrities backing Hillary give her an 'unfair' advantage. Trump, a man who once okay'd a DJ calling his daughter a 'piece of ass' and who bragged about grabbing women 'by the pussy,' went so far as to lament the language used in some of Jay Z's songs. 
'He used every word in the book last night,' Trump said. 'He used language last night that was so bad and then Hillary said, 'I did not like Donald Trump's lewd language.' My lewd language. I tell you what, I've never said what he said in my life.' 
Eye roll. 
Meanwhile, in related news, Trump will be campaigning with his own star power tonight. The cream of the crop. The best of the best. The A-listerâ€¦Ted Nugent. A man who once ' joked ' about shooting Hillary Clinton with a machine gun. 
'Obama, he's a piece of shit. I told him to suck on my machine gun. Hey Hillary,' he continued. 'You might want to ride one of these into the sunset, you worthless bitch.' 
Yeah, Trump sure seems concerned about what language musicians use.

A Republican unhappy that his party was being hijacked by Donald Trump attended a Trump rally to protest and found himself being swarmed first by an angry mob, then by Secret Service agents. The room full of Second Amendment fanatics panicked when one of Trump's fans yelled 'gun!' and Trump was rushed from the stage. Immediately, Trump's campaign began spinning the lie that this man had intended to assassinate Trump. 
In fact, all he was armed with was a poster saying 'Republicans Against Trump.' The whole incident was over nothing. But it didn't stop Trump's fans from pretending this proved Trump was a profile in courage. His campaign's social media director retweeted a (false) message that Trump was back on stage after an 'assassination attempt'â€“ like he was Teddy goddamn Roosevelt, speaking with a bullet in his chest .

But while the Secret Service did the right thing by not taking chances, the idea that this incident makes Trump brave is laughable. He returned to the stage precisely because there was no threat . Mere minutes after agents tackled the 'assassin' they realized the guy was a harmless protester carrying a poster and had no weapons. He was released shortly afterwards. 
Meanwhile, there is an example of a candidate staring down a scary situation and not blinking. It's Hillary Clinton. 
Unlike the poster-carrying Republican, a protester in Iowa once rushed Clinton's stage and actually almost got within arm's reach of her. She took a quick glance as her Secret Service detail tackled the protesterâ€¦ and kept talking. Protester tries to storm the stage as Clinton speaks in Iowa. PO-92WE pic.twitter.com/liidhzUSqR

So let's hear Trump's followers call Hillary Clinton brave for doing what Trump did not. We'll wait.

This election has been exhausting for all of us, but can you imagine how Alec Baldwin must feel, having to portray a man like Donald Trump every week? I truly hope he gets an Emmy out of this â€” it might be the only thing that could make all of this seem worth it to him. And Kate McKinnon deserves one too. The two of them are perhaps the best match-up in the history of SNL's political satire. 
Saturday's cold open on SNL began much like they have since Alec Baldwin took on the role of Donald Trump. He and Kate McKinnon, who portrays Hillary Clinton, appeared on Erin Burnett's (played by Cecily Strong) show Out Front to speak one last time before the election this Tuesday. 
After trading their usual scripted insults, Baldwin had clearly had enough and stopped. 
'I'm sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling this stuff at you like this.' 
Kate agrees, saying she finds this election all so 'mean,' Then, while addressing the camera and the SNL audience, Alec Baldwin says:

November 7, 2016 Michelle Obama Warns That 'Playing Around With A Protest Vote' Will Lead To A Trump Win (VIDEO)   
Speaking at Hillary Clinton's rally in Philadelphia on the eve of the election, Michelle Obama had a warning for American voters: Choosing not to vote or casting a protest vote will put Donald Trump in the White House. 
The first lady also tried to make sure that the voters listening to her speech, whether in person or on television, understand just how important their vote really is. 
'And here's the beauty of it all, this election is on us. It is on us. If we get out and vote tomorrow, Hillary Clinton will win,' she said. 'But, if we stay home or if we play around with a protest vote, then Hillary's opponent will win. Period. End of story.' 
'Look, it is important to understand that presidential elections are breathtakingly close. They are decided by just 5, 10, 15 votes per precinct,' she added. 
Michelle Obama's passionate plea comes after a long and contentious campaign. Some people are convinced their vote doesn't matter. Some people are still pouting because their favorite candidate didn't win the primary. Others have swallowed the kool-aid and believe both candidates are the same. But Michelle Obama is right, not voting or voting for a third party candidate is the same as casting a vote for Trump. Quite frankly, there is just too much at stake for that this time around. 
Watch Michelle Obama give warn Americans about the importance of their vote, here:

Rumors are circulating of who Donald Trump is considering to serve as his cabinet members if he wins on Tuesday, and the names on his list will chill you to the bone. 
According to several sources close to Trump, high ranking Republicans who have stood by the GOP nominee's side throughout the campaign have made the short list. Which means, of course, that he has chosen the worst of the worst. 
NBC reports : 
'Among the names being considered, according to conversations with three campaign advisers who requested anonymity to speak freely: Rudy Giuliani for attorney general, Newt Gingrich for secretary of state, retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn for defense secretary or national security adviser, Trump finance chairman Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, and Republican National Committee finance chair Lew Eisenberg for commerce secretary.' 
Reince Priebus, the current RNC chairman, is also being considered as a possibility to serve as Trump's chief of staff. He earned the favor of the bigoted billionaire by staunchly defending him time and time again when other Republicans were quick to jump ship. 
'They're thinking, 'We need to find that balance between someone who knows how Washington works and someone who shakes things up,'' the senior campaign adviser said. 
NBC points out that appointing Priebus as chief of staff would be 'an olive branch to the establishment,' but it isn't clear at the moment if the RNC chair would even consider taking the position. 
One veteran of the George W. Bush White House said that Trump's transition team had convinced him that they were looking for people to fill these positions that had 'experience' in Washington. 
'They're reaching out to people with experience, they're listening to them, they're taking their counsel,' the former official said. 'I was very impressed.' 
The NBC report did say that Trump really isn't putting the cart before the horse, so to speak. The sources they spoke to said the Trump campaign is 'focused on winning first and foremost as well and no decisions have been made or positions finalized.' Trump campaign spokesman Hope Hicks said that 'none of this is accurate' and added that Trump 'is entirely focused on the campaign and the American people.'

November 7, 2016 Influential Journalist Nails It: Trump Will Be In Jail Soon, But A Clinton Win Means Stalemate Term   
In an interview with The National , New Yorker journalist and New York Times best-selling author, Malcolm Gladwell, was asked by Wendy Mesley to predict what the next four years will look like after tomorrow's votes are in. 
With understandable trepidation, the show's host inquired what would happen if Trump wins, to which the English-born Canadian writer's answer was simple: 
'I think he'll be in jail within a year. We've got the Trump University fraud case, we probably have criminal charges coming out of his charitable donation. We've got all of the Russian ties we don't know much about. He's got so many legal problems, I suspect he'll spend the next few years huddled with his lawyers.' 
So, what does Gladwell think will happen when Hillary is elected? 
'Republicans in Congress will start an investigation of her on day one, which will only end when she leaves office four years later. The forecast for the next four years is just stalemate. Their hatred will not be satiated by a Hillary Clinton victory, it will be enhanced. For twenty years they have been coming after this woman and they're gonna keep coming after her.' Adding, 'It will result in some kind of political paralysis for sure.' 
Gladwell does not paint a very inspiring picture of a Clinton win, for sure, but it is better than the alternative. We all know Trump belongs in jail, but he can't be allowed to bring the entire nation down with him. In short, get your ass out and vote! 
Also, watch the full CBC interview where Gladwell discusses sexism, elitism, racism and the baffling media obsession with Hillary's emails:

In case you missed it, on Sunday, FBI Director Comey once again cleared Hillary Clinton of any wrong-doing with regard to her emails â€” this, after just a couple of weeks ago saying to congress, that emails found in connection to the Anthony Weiner investigation could have something to do with Hillary's case. By speculating about these mysterious emails, that we now know had absolutely NOTHING to do with Hillary Clinton, Comey may have been in direct violation of the Hatch Act . Let's hope Director Comey will have to endure his own investigation very soon! 
Speaking of speculation, on a special edition of CNN's AC360 Sunday night, Anderson Cooper brought up that very thing to Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. 
'Is it responsible for someone who might be president of the United States to be, in your words, 'speculating' about an active investigation when he has no actual facts?' 
Kellyanne tried to change the attention back to Hillary Clinton's use of a private server, but Anderson wasn't having it and asks again. 
'Right, you are not answering the question, though. Is it irresponsible for a man who might be president of the United States to speculate about something about which he has no facts?'

By Allison Vincent Election 2016 , Faux Fox , News , Politics November 7, 2016 Sarah Palin Goes Off The Rails Again, Says Hillary's Lead Is Because 'Polls Are For Strippers' (VIDEO) 903   
If you were thinking this election couldn't get any more ridiculous, just watch this interview between Sarah Palin and Bill O'Reilly on Sunday's episode of The O'Reilly Factor. 
Palin has been largely absent from the campaign trail in recent months, even skipping the Republican National Convention, but she has still been a very vocal supporter of Trump. Judging from her Facebook page, one might even assume that she is 'hot, hot, hot for Trump!' since she enjoys using that phrase so much. That tone was evident in her interview with O'Reilly when she mentioned that she heard Bill saying earlier that maybe the 'Trump momentum' had slowed down. 
'You're not in Michigan, then,' Palin said, 'cos they are hot, hot, hot for Trump!' 
O'Reilly, with uncharacteristic fairness, points out that Hillary Clinton is sill leading in the polls: 
'The polls say that Clinton's up by five. Are you willing to make a prediction that Trump will carry Michigan this time around?' 
Palin's response to that is so mind-bogglingly crazy, that you just have to watch it for yourself. And it doesn't end there. Here's the full video:

November 8, 2016 Trump Supporter Pulls Gun On Black Man At Polling Station For Refusing To Vote Trump, Gets Arrested Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
We knew it was going to happen, and honestly, it could have been a lot worse. Still, it's shocking that this is what our elections have come to. 
A Trump supporter picked a fight with a voter at a Palm Beach polling place over his choice of candidate. The crazed right-winger ended up pulling a gun on the African American man who was simply trying to cast his vote. 
According to the victim , Tobian Norris, he was on his way to vote when he ran into a Trump supporter intent on causing trouble. 
'I saw this guy, he was basically soliciting votes for Donald Trump and he decided he wanted to solicit me,' Norris said. 
He says he made it clear that there was no way he would ever consider voting for Trump. After a brief discussion about Trump and his opponent, Hillary Clinton, Norris finally asked the Trump supporter if he had graduated high school and all hell broke loose. The man lunged at Norris, attacking him and knocking the phone he had been using to film the incident to the ground. 
'He grabbed my hand and knocked the phone out of my hand and called me the n-word, and I just blacked out and hit him in the ribs, and he pulled a gun on me,' Norris recalled. 
When Norris defended himself, punching the assailant in the ribs, the crazed man did what any good Trump supporter would do: He pulled out a gun. 
The victim ran and was thankfully unharmed. This could have ended so much worse. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's deputies arrived and arrested the gun toting Trump follower. 
Norris recorded the entire exchange and posted it live on Facebook. You can watch the video below:

On Monday, Paul LePage, Maine's infamous racist Governor, issued a statement which basically threatened any out-of-state student attending college in his state with an investigation should they decide to vote. 
LePage's statement came on the eve of Election Day, and many believe it was designed to scare Democratic leaning college students away from the polls. 
The governor complained about Democrats encouraging out-of-state students to commit voter fraud by voting in both their home state and the state where they are attending college. He also said that 'there is no way to determine' if a person has cast his or her ballot in two states. 
The Washington Post : 
'Democrats for decades have encouraged college students from out of state to vote in Maine, even though there is no way to determine whether these college students also voted in their home states,' LePage said in a statement. 
'Casting ballots in two different states is voter fraud, which is why Maine law requires anyone voting here to establish residency here. We welcome college students establishing residency in our great state, as long as they follow all laws that regulate voting, motor vehicles and taxes. We cannot tolerate voter fraud in our state.' 
LePage continued, 'After the election, we will do everything we can that is allowed under state and federal law to verify college students who voted here are following Maine law, which is clearly displayed on the Secretary of State's website.' 
However, Maine's Secretary of State, Matthew Dunlap, says that they do have a system in place to detected that kind of voter fraud, and they've yet to find evidence of this being a real issue. Dunlap told WMTW ABC 8: 
'People are not voting in two different jurisdictions. In fact, the Secretary of State's office back in 2011 did just such an investigation of over 200 students who were from out of state, and who had registered and voted in Maine to see if they had voted in their home state, and nobody did.' 
Along with the Governor's statement, college students at Bates College received a mysterious orange flyer informing them that if they are out of state, students that they must change their driver's license and re-register their vehicle (which the flyer claimed cost 'usually hundreds of dollars in total'). 
The flyer included an official government website address, as well as references to several state statutes regarding the registration of personal motorized vehicles in Maine. College students in Maine: This flyer is FALSE. You may use your dorm as your legal address to vote. pic.twitter.com/jOE6MvH02s 
â€” Maine College Dems (@MECollegeDem) November 7, 2016 
To the average college student, this flyer would probably seem legit. However, as the above tweet states, college students are allowed to use their dorm address as their permanent residence while attending school in the state. 
Maine's chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has requested that the Justice Department step in to investigate. 
'The governor's statement seems designed to make college students afraid to vote,' Zachary Heiden, legal director at the ACLU of Maine, said in a statement. 'Voter intimidation and harassment is illegal, and we call on the Department of Justice to investigate the intent of the governor's comments. 
'College students who live in Maine have the right to vote in Maine, and they are not subject to different laws than anyone else. Many of these young people are voting for the first time in a presidential election. The governor should be encouraging that civic participation, not doing everything in his power to undermine it.' 
Maine's Democratic party is calling this a classic case of GOP voter suppression efforts aimed at minority groups whom they feel will vote Democratic. 
'The false information contained in these fliers is a deliberate attempt to suppress the millennial vote,' Maine Democratic Party Chairman Phil Bartlett said in a statement. 'There is nothing in Maine law that states that college students must change their driver's licenses in order to vote. 
'In fact, the Secretary of State's office has made explicitly clear that a dorm can be a student's legal voting residence, and that paying out-of-state tuition does not preclude a student from voting. Maine also has same-day voter registration, so students who are not registered to vote in Maine can still register on Election Day. We urge all Bates students to spread the word to their fellow classmates about their voting rights here in Maine.' 
Despite their best efforts, numerous states are reporting record turnout numbers, which traditionally doesn't bode well for Republicans who prefer low voter turnout for any group that's isn't non-educated, white, and male.

Donald Trump, already laying the ground work for a 'rigged election' challenge after he loses, filed a frivolous lawsuit in Nevada that sought to erase the votes of many residents of Clark County because they dared wait line past the time polls closed (as was their legal right) and got their vote in during early voting. 
The lawsuit, on its face, was insane. Trump was arguing that people who waited in the long lines to vote should have been sent home once the polls officially closed. This is contrary to the law, which says that as long as a person is in line at the time of closing, they are legally entitled to cast their ballot. This is done specifically to ensure crooked politicians couldn't disenfranchise voters by intentionally making lines so long that the poll workers can't possibly get to all of the people. 
As reporter Jon Ralston noted in disbelief as the court case unfolded: This lawsuit has even less merit than I thought. And that is saying something.

Chris Christie was once one of Trump's fiercest critics â€“ shortly before endorsing him. Since that time, Christie has bounced from humiliation to humiliation at the hands of Trump. Stories of Trump's schoolyard bullying of Christie range from the time he made the Governor of New Jersey get him french fries, to the time he publicly mocked his weight, to the time he told Christie to get off the stage and wait on the plane, to the time he suggested Christie could be vice president only to change him mind at the last minute and pick Mike Pence instead. 
The last 16 months have been hard on Christie. The indignities were written all over his face as he walked, alone and in the dark , towards the voting booth in New Jersey. A man, broken and demoralized, casting a vote for the guy who routinely humiliated him. If a picture says a thousand words, then what does this say? Here's a picture of Christie going to vote this morning at 6:06 am, right when polls opened. He didn't tell press. https://t.co/3QIgk1sgBW pic.twitter.com/tJEMSwN1y0

Perhaps nobody in America had a worse year than Gov. Chris Christie â€“ and nobody has deserved his comeuppance more. All but conceding that his time in politics was over, the deeply unpopular governor ignored the job he was elected to do in New Jersey to fly around the country with Donald Trump. Those fast food orders weren't going to pick up themselves. 
In the meantime, the 'Bridgegate' scandal that had torched his administration was drawing to a close, with several of his former advisers implicating Christie himself in the plan to shut down traffic to punish a political rival. Just last week, things reached their inevitable conclusion with many of his closest staffers being convicted of the crimes. Christie, who has no possible route to office ever again, seems to understand that 2016 marked a Rubicon of sorts. He crossed the river and there is no going back. His reputation, his lifetime's work in government, his chances for a future presidency, have all gone up in smoke. 
And so he drudged in the bitterly cold New Jersey pre-dawn towards the ballot box. Broken, beaten, and hollow. Chris Christie casts his vote for Donald Trump; his abuser, yes, but also the only man who will take his calls.

Well, that sure didn't take long. Only 12 hours into Election Day and Eric Trump has already broken the law. 
The Trump family isn't known for their ability to follow the law. Eric Trump apparently decided to start off his day by voting for his narcissistic dad and then breaking the law by posting a picture of his completed ballot on Twitter. Image via Buzzfeed 
This just happens to violate New York election law. Oops. But hey, it's not like this has been a law for a long time right? Only 126 years. The law stipulates that any person who '[s]hows his ballot after it is prepared for voting, to any person so as to reveal the contents â€¦ is guilty of a misdemeanor.' 
Eric Trump was quickly notified that his tweet, featuring a pic of his ballot, was illegal. Image via Buzzfeed 
The law was recently challenged by a group of voters who asked a federal judge to issue an injunction that would allow voters to take ballot selfies. The judge denied their request, ruling on Nov. 3 that, 'The public's interest in orderly elections outweighs the plaintiffs' interest in taking and posting ballot selfies.' 
According to the judge, the posting of ballot selfies would slow down the voting process, causing unnecessary delays, and threaten the guarantee of 'election integrity.' 
Eric Trump eventually removed his tweet, but thanks to screenshots, it hasn't actually gone away. I have to ask at this point, can't these people get anything right? Seriously, they managed to screw up voting? By breaking the law? With Twitter ? Of course, they did.

It's do or die time for Trump, and so not surprising the lies are rolling in at a record speed â€“ this time involving a fake celebrity endorsement by Super Bowl champ, Tom Brady. 
Up until now, the New England Patriots quarterback has remained silent on who he will be voting for in Election 2016, but the cat is out of the bag and it's in direct contrast to what Trump is saying. 
At a Manchester, New Hampshire, rally Monday night, Trump shared with the crowd a phone call he supposedly received from his buddy Brady, where Tom told the Republican presidential candidate he had voted for him. Trump told the cheering crowd: 
'Great guy, great friend of mine â€” great, great champion. Unbelievable winner. He called today and he said, 'Donald, I support you, you're my friend, and I voted for you. And I said, 'So Tom. You voted for me, you support me, am I allowed to say it tonight at this massive crowd in New Hampshire?' He said, 'If you want to say it, you can say it.' OK? Tom, that's what a champ is all about.' 
Watch Trump's embarrassing display of buddy name-dropping here: 
But there are a couple of problems with this glowing endorsement. Just hours before, on Boston's 'Kirk & Callahan Show' on WEEI Tom Brady said he hadn't voted yet. Since early voting in Massachusetts ended Friday, he could not have voted in the hours between the show and the phone call, unless he mailed his ballot in, which is highly unlikely. 
But what is most damning is an exchange his wife, supermodel Gisele BÃ¼ndchen, had on her Instagram page on Friday. 
When a follower asked, 'Gisele I heard you and Tom were backing Trump! Is that true???' 
Gisele responded with a resounding, 'NO!' 
Here is the exchange as posted on Twitter by Chris Sacca: Three days ago on Instagram, @giseleofficial told a random dude she and Brady weren't backing Donald. ðŸ¤” pic.twitter.com/oiAcUgqkKK 
â€” Chris Sacca (@sacca) November 8, 2016 
Granted, it is possible Tom Brady lied to Trump. Tom isn't exactly known for his honesty, having been suspended for the first four games of this NFL season for cheating in the now infamous Deflategate Scandal . 
Either way, Gisele's posting speaks volumes about who she and her husband WILL be voting for. Perhaps ending the Brady-Trump bromance for good.

Donald Trump is not very popular in New York City. Obviously, he lives in his big tower with his name in gold on the city's famed Fifth Avenue, but if the images of him walking into his polling place to vote for himself are any indication, what he thinks of himself isn't what the people of New York City think of him. 
As Trump went to vote with his wife Melania and daughter Ivanka, flanked by Secret Service agents, he was booed loudly by voters waiting in line. This isn't surprising if you've lived in New York, as I have. It is always a blue state, and it is also extraordinarily accepting of all people. Trump, however, throughout his travesty of a campaign run on hatred, fear, ignorance, and bigotry, has shown himself to be the exact opposite of most New Yorkers. 
If this video is any indication, it seems that the start of Election Day does not bode well for how it will end for Trump and his hateful supporters.

After a trainwreck campaign, Trump supporters are struggling to find ways to motivate people to vote for their candidate. Trump has alienated nearly every voting bloc in the country, and routinely smears the sort of people who would otherwise be undecided voters. The question for his supporters is how to get people to set aside their hatred for the man and cast their vote for him anyway. For one horse breeder, the answer is semen. 
In what has been described as 'gross,''totally illegal,' and the most Trumpian thing ever, a Texas Trumper posted on his Facebook page that he would be giving a 50 percent off coupon to all Trump voters good for either one breeding session with his stallions, or frozen semen for the horse owner on the go. 
The post was flagged by Talking Points Memo's Josh Marshall who noted that offering people compensation â€“ even if it's half off horse semen â€“ for a vote for Trump violates election law. This is totally illegal; also perhaps the most appropriately Trumpian vote buying scheme possible to devise https://t.co/7n0kDam7ZS pic.twitter.com/f11T5dEOmR

After mockery and disbelief swept the internet, the post was deleted from Facebook.

This entire election season has been insane and no one has broken it down like Seth Meyers has in his nightly segments A Closer Look. 
On the eve of the election, Meyers decided to focus this segment on how the two candidates have handled their campaigns during the final stretch. He took a few minor shots at Hillary, but the bulk of his time was spent incredulously trying to make sense out of what has gone on with Trump during the last 3 days in particular. He also shares a highly entertaining clip of President Obama's 'burns' on Trump. 
While Hillary Clinton has been campaigning with mega-stars like Katy Perry, Beyonce, Jay-Z, Bruce Springsteen and Lady Gaga, Trump hasâ€¦Scott Baio. Trump couldn't seem to stop whining about Hillary's celebrities all weekend, even saying how horrible and inappropriate Jay-Z's lyrics were. Yes. Thisâ€¦coming from the man who inspired the newest phrase 'p*ssygate' and had the likes of Ted Nugent grabbing his crotch and referencing his 'blue balls' at a rally over the weekend. 
After showing a clip of Trump bitching about all of these A-listers and saying he doesn't need them or their guitars and pianos, Seth had a message for the Republican candidate: 
'That's okay, I've got an instrument for you Donald â€” the world's smallest violin,' Meyers said. 'It should be noted that with your hands, it would be a regular size violin.'

He called it. Many times. 
Michael Moore, the controversial documentary filmmaker, is a staunch Democrat and Clinton supporter, but has been saying all along that Trump was going to win. 
On Real Time with Bill Maher in July, Moore cried out, 'Get out of your bubble, people!' He listed five reasons why Trump was going to be the next president and he was creepy correct. 
For example, his first reason 'The Rust Belt/Brexit Strategy' played out before our eyes last night: 
'Mitt Romney lost by 64 electoral votes. The total votes of [Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania ]â€¦ 64. All he (Trump) has to do is win those four states.' 
You can check out the whole list, explained in detail, here . 
And during a talk posted on Youtube on October 24 th , Moore also explained why Trump was gonna win. 
But the ever-optimistic Moore is not wasting his time saying, 'I told you so.' Instead, he has put out a call for action. On his Facebook page, he posted a to-do list and it looks like this time people are listening. The posting has gone viral, with 218K reactions, 10K comments and almost 100K shares on Facebook alone. 
So, without further adoâ€¦ Michael Moore's Morning After To-Do List: Take over the Democratic Party and return it to the people. They have failed us miserably Fire all pundits, predictors, pollsters and anyone else in the media who had a narrative they wouldn't let go of and refused to listen to or acknowledge what was really going on. Those same bloviators will now tell us we must 'heal the divide' and 'come together.' They will pull more hooey like that out of their ass in the days to come. Turn them off. Any Democratic member of Congress who didn't wake up this morning ready to fight, resist and obstruct in the way Republicans did against President Obama every day for eight full years must step out of the way and let those of us who know the score lead the way in stopping the meanness and the madness that's about to begin. Everyone must stop saying they are 'stunned' and 'shocked.' What you mean to say is that you were in a bubble and weren't paying attention to your fellow Americans and their despair. YEARS of being neglected by both parties, the anger and the need for revenge against the system only grew. Along came a TV star they liked whose plan was to destroy both parties and tell them all 'You're fired!' Trump's victory is no surprise. He was never a joke. Treating him as one only strengthened him. He is both a creature and a creation of the media and the media will never own that. You must say this sentence to everyone you meet today: 'HILLARY CLINTON WON THE POPULAR VOTE!' The MAJORITY of our fellow Americans preferred Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Period. Fact. If you woke up this morning thinking you live in an effed-up country, you don't. The majority of your fellow Americans wanted Hillary, not Trump. The only reason he's president is because of an arcane, insane 18th-century idea called the Electoral College. Until we change that, we'll continue to have presidents we didn't elect and didn't want. You live in a country where a majority of its citizens have said they believe there's climate change, they believe women should be paid the same as men, they want a debt-free college education, they don't want us invading countries, they want a raise in the minimum wage and they want a single-payer true universal health care system. None of that has changed. We live in a country where the majority agree with the 'liberal' position. We just lack the liberal leadership to make that happen (see: #1 above). Let's try to get this all done by noon today.

Donald Trump's shocking presidential win last night has left most of the world in mortified awe, but one leader seems especially pleased by the upset, perhaps because he had something to do with it. 
Just hours after Trump took the stage to deliver his acceptance speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated the president-elect on his win. It was only three weeks ago, at the third presidential debate that Hillary Clinton said Trump would be Putin's 'puppet' and it looks like Putin is eager to take on the master's role. 
Speaking from the Kremlin, Putin specifically praised Trump on his vow to restore relations with Russia: 
'We understand the way to that will be difficult, taking into account the current state of degradation of relations between the US and Russia. As I have repeatedly said, that is not our fault that Russia-US relations are in that state. Russia is ready and wants to restore the fully-fledged relations with the US. I repeat we understand this will be difficult, but we are ready to play our part in it.' 
And what part will Trump play? Ask Sergei Markov. The pro-Kremlin political analyst, who was equally thrilled by the election outcome, is confident Trump will have America do a 180 on the Syrian debacle and join Russia in its backing of Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. 
There is every reason to believe the analyst, too. At the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, Hillary Clinton joked that Trump was ' healthy as a horse â€“ you know the one Vladimir Putin rides on'. It looks like she might be right. Trump has always seemed a bit cozy with the Russian president , but now he may actually owe him a debt of gratitude for the Kremlin's part in his win. 
In relation to Russian interference in the election, Markov said, 'Maybe we helped a bit with WikiLeaks.' 
Up until now the Kremlin has denied any involvement; Putin calling The Obama administration's accusations they hacked Democratic Party emails, then leaking them to WikiLeaks, as 'nonsense' claims. 
Markov did admit it might not be all smooth riding, adding, 'Putin is a macho, Trump is also a macho. Maybe it could be a problem.' 
Alexei Venediktov, the editor-in-chief of Russia's liberal Echo of Moscow radio, agrees: 'Putin doesn't like unpredictability and Trump is the definition of unpredictability.' 
I guess we will just have to see who will be riding whom.

By Joe Clark Election 2016 , Politics , Racism November 9, 2016 This Comment About Trump's Win Will Make You THINK HARD About The Full Horror Of What Just Happened   
On November 8, 2016, an almost evenly divided America made a consequential choice. 
And in the end, they chose to elect the least most qualified candidate in U.S. history to become the 45th President of the United States of America. 
However, one Twitter user said something so profound, that it should send a chill up the spine of any decent and rational American. The tweet said: 
'Our first black president will have to have over the White House to someone endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan. Just let that sink in.' Our first black president will have to hand over the White House to someone endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan. Just let that sink in. 
â€” Salon (@Salon) November 9, 2016 
Yes, we should all allow that sink in for a few moments. 
After the election, neo-Nazis, Alt-Righters, White Supremacists, and the Ku Klux Klan are all celebrating Trump's election. 
Meanwhile, few, if any, minorities are doing the same, because they understand what his presidency will mean for their lives and the lives of their children. 
And while we can keep telling ourselves that 'this is not who we are,' it's important to recognize that it was that same denial that brought us to this point in our history. 
It's time we took a hard look in the mirror and at the country we've created.

In what amounts to the first pang of just how profound America's Election Day screw up truly was, Trump's campaign is reportedly already working on a plan to scrub that last eight years of progress out of existence on Trump's very first day in office . No Obama accomplishment will remain. They even have a name for the plan: The First Day Project. 
Organized by the Heritage Foundation, the goal is to deprive Obama of any lasting effect to his time in office. It's a perverse sort of vengeance from a group of clowns who have spent the last decade smearing the president at every possible step of the way. 
Trump aides are organizing what one Republican close to the campaign calls the First Day Project. 'Trump spends several hours signing papersâ€”and erases the Obama Presidency,' he said. Stephen Moore, an official campaign adviser who is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, explained, 'We want to identify maybe twenty-five executive orders that Trump could sign literally the first day in office.' 
Thinking back over Obama's list of wins â€“ from gay rights to healthcare to the economy â€“ the idea that these achievements can be erased by a collective of spiteful, bitter men in a matter of hours is almost too much to bear. The suffering to the people whose rights will surely be rolled back will be immense. 
And on a separate, but equally terrifying front, Trump's campaign surrogate Omarosa told reporters that Trump has been compiling an 'enemies list'â€“ an assortment of people on the right and left who openly stood against him â€“ and he plans on punishing those on the list when he gets to office. 
'I would never judge anybody for exercising their right to and the freedom to choose who they want. But let me just tell you, Mr. Trump has a long memory and we're keeping a list.' 
Erase his predecessor, punish his enemies. In this way, with pen and sword, Trump plans to dismantle a democracy. The oldest, greatest one in the world â€“ up until the point when it wasn't.

While pundits and the Trump campaign claim this election was won by his appeal to the 'working class' who are feeling economic anxiety, it's clear that even Trump's most fervent supporters don't really believe that. At what could have been a celebratory moment for the Republican campaign and its voters, a Trump fanatic couldn't help but scream about the only issue he really cared about: A violent bloodlust directed at the first black president. 
And the fact that Trump couldn't stand up to this man, even after being named 'president-elect' speaks volumes. He's not in control. The mob is. And the mob is demanding blood. 
This is the reality America is waking up to today.

It's almost statistically impossible that you haven't heard at least one person threaten to move to Canada if Donald Trump won the presidential election. Well, he did. And it appears that at least some of those would-be emigrants weren't kidding. At around 11 pm Tuesday night â€“ just as things really went to hell for Hillary Clinton â€“ Canada's immigration website began to receive record breaking traffic. It then crashed completely. 
In case you were wondering, moving to Canada can be quite difficult . It may even take years. To some degree it depends on what profession you're in and how desired the work you do would be to the nation of Canada. Upon writing this the website still will not load reliably; but in the off chance it's running properly by the time you read this I've included a link ( HERE ). 
The world's stock markets have been sent into turmoil at the shocking news that reality tv star Donald Trump actually pulled off the win. But if you're thinking of moving to Canada just because of the impending stock market Armageddon, don't bother. It's likely that the whole world will go into another recession if Trump really scraps the trade deals he's promising to. Sort of like a Brexit on a much bigger scale. In fact, many are saying that the combined influence of the UK's departure from the EU and ours from the majority of our trade relationships might spell a very wide-spread fiscal crisis. 
Trump, for one, tried to calm these fears in his victory speech. He said that he plans to deal with everyone 'fairly.' But this is unlikely to work. The market ultimately responds cautiously to change and whether that change is going to be fair or not doesn't really make much difference. Trump has promised to do away with the establishment. And that's likely to scare economists. One can only hope that as our new president, he proceeds with the cautious tone he could not find during the campaign. Or we could just all move to Canada.

Donald Trump has a Twitter problem. He has so little self-control when it comes to his chosen form of communication that in the final days of his presidential run, Trump's team actually took control of his Twitter account away from him. Well, it seems that now that the election is over, Trump is back in control of that account, and he will be the president of out of control tweets. 
As everyone knows by now, Trump's new position as President-elect has sparked nationwide protests by people who are standing against the hate and bigotry that Trump represents. In NYC alone, a massive peaceful protest broke out, filling the streets with people who wanted to make a statement: Donald Trump's bigotry does not represent all Americans. Wow! #NotMyPresident protest in NYC right now. pic.twitter.com/RY7ALHQFih

Notoriously thin-skinned, the moment Trump got his Twitter account back, he let loose in a rage for the ages, accusing the protesters of being paid to do what they are doing, and of being incited by a biased media. Here is a screenshot of that tweet, just in case someone around him decides it would be wise to delete it: 
So, in other words, Trump has once again showed America how temperamentally unfit he is to be president. If people exercising their First Amendment rights in protesting him and his policies provokes this kind of reaction, what will he do with the nuclear codes and the power of the presidency at his disposal? What will he do when a foreign leader insults him, or stands up to him or disagrees with him? We should all be terrified at the thought of such a situation. 
Twitter reacted with mockery as well as horror:

Donald Trump is unhinged, and he keeps proving it. No matter how 'presidential' or 'gracious' he may have seemed during his meeting with President Obama or during his victory speech, do not be fooled. Make no mistake â€“ this man is a hot-head and a loose cannon, and the 59 million suckers in America just made him the most powerful man in the world.

Trump spent five years spreading racist lies meant to convince people Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States. He spent the 2016 election calling him the worst president of all time. And upon finally meeting President Obama face-to-faceâ€¦ he now says he likes him? 
In one of the oddest tweets Trump has ever sent, the president-elect said he had a 'really good meeting' and 'great chemistry' (what?) with Obama. He added that his wife really liked Michelle Obama, as well. A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot! 
â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 
'Chemistry?' Really? What a creep. 
The feeling did not appear to be mutual. After the meeting, Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that the two men had views that were so radically different from one another that neither man even tried to discuss them during their first meeting. Obama also reiterated that he stood by calling Trump ' unfit ' for office. 
Asked whether the President still considers Trump 'temperamentally unfit' and 'uniquely unqualified' after the pair met for the first time Thursday morning, Earnest said that Obama stood by those remarks. 
'Look, the president's views haven't changed,' Earnest said. 'He stands by what he said on the campaign trail. He had an opportunity to make his argument. He made that argument vigorously. He made that argument in states all across the country. But the American people decided.' 
It was also reported that the Obamas decided to cancel a photo op with Donald and Melania Trump scheduled for after the meeting. (The White House denied that anything was meant by the cancellation, naturally.) 
Trump's sudden aboutface on Obama only reinforces what many had suspected all along. His nasty remarks, his damaging rhetoric, his vicious smears on the president were all lies he used as a blunt force instrument to convince his base to vote for him. He knew they were lies when he said them, he simply didn't care if they were being used to destroy Obama's reputation to get what he wanted. Now that he's won the election, those lies have outgrown their usefulness. 
But lest one think this represents a 'pivot' to maturity, just eight minutes later, he promptly descended into a temper tantrum unbecoming of a president. Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! 
â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 
The man who up until the day of the election was screaming about rigged voting machines and illegal voters suddenly thinks protesting his election is 'very unfair.' He also tapped into his favorite few scapegoats â€“'professional protesters' (i.e. Democrats) and the media. In one tweet, we get a glimpse at just how ugly Trump's administration will be. People who criticize him will be publicly attacked by the president himself. The media who covers him will be demonized. And Trump will spend more time whining than governing. 
Pathetic.

Now that the election is over, Donald Trump is deciding who he will appoint to fill his cabinet. Although most the names on his list are fairly horrifying, none more so than who he is considering for White House Chief of Staff. Trump's top pick is reportedly former Breitbart bigwig, Steve Bannon. 
So what does a chief of staff do ? Well, the person holding this position is often called 'the most powerful man in Washington.' 
'The duties of the White House chief of staff vary, yet traditionally encompass the following, such as: select and supervise key White House staff, control access to the Oval Office and the president, manage communications and information flow, and negotiate with Congress, executive branch agencies, and external political groups to implement the president's agenda.' 
'In fulfilling these duties, the chief of Staff oversees and coordinates the efforts of the following offices within the EOP and White House Office: the Council of Economic Advisers, National Security staff, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Legislative Affairs, and Office of Management and Administration, to name a few.' 
Okay, so that's an important job. So who the hell is Steve Bannon? Not surprisingly, he is the worst of the worst. 
David Badash over at The New Civil Rights Movement summed it up quite nicely: Bannon 'stepped down at Breitbart to run the final few months of Trump's campaign, but for years he has run one of the most popular far, far right wing websites, Breitbart. It masquerades as a news site but it's home to the alt-right, as Bannon has bragged. In other words, the white supremacists and white nationalists, the anti-Semites, the anti-LGBT crowd, the anti-Black crowd, the anti-diversity, anti-feminism, anti-Obama movement. Racists, homophobes, bigots of every stripe get their 'news' at Breitbart. And it got Trump elected.' 
According to court filings from his divorce proceedings, Bannon is not only a sadistic wife beater , but he is also every bit as anti-Semitic as Breitbart itself. His wife testified that he fought against allowing his daughters to attend an upscale school because of the number of Jewish children that attended. 
'He said that he doesn't like the way they raise their kids to be 'whiny brats' and that he didn't want the girls going to school with Jews.' 
This man , this is who Trump wants to have serving as the White House Chief of Staff. His advisors are encouraging him to choose RNC Chair Reince Priebus, but we all know how Trump is with taking advice from people who might actually know what they're talking about. Who cares if Bannon actually knows anything about how to run the damn country, Trump just wants the biggest bigot he can find.

There's a change.org petition being passed around by progressives right now â€” with 1.4 million signatures at the time of this writing â€” that asks the Electoral College to break historical precedent, ignore the laws in their respective states, face whatever political and legal consequences there may be (if an elector in a red state did that, they would and should fear for their lives. Think about it), and vote for Hillary Clinton despite the way the cards fell. It's a dumb petition and you shouldn't sign it. It's never, never, ever going to happen that way. And furthermore, because of the way the numbers stack up, there are more Republican than Democratic electors â€” they want him elected. It's never going to happen. 
Don't get me wrong â€” I'm all for democratizing the presidential election process. Want the popular vote to pick the president? I'm right there with you . However, this petition isn't going to accomplish that, and not so deep down, I think you know that. 
What it is going to do is make you feel a little bit better about not doing anything to actually make it happen. That's all online petitions typically do, unless there is a pledge for personal action attached. That's not the solution here â€” especially since there is a REAL solution to the problem of the electoral college on the table. The petition being passed around is going to make people feel complacent, and less likely to call a state legislator, which is the real way to go about this. The electoral college won't stop this â€” in fact, the electoral college needs to go. 
There is a movement and bill in the works that binds individual states' electors to casting electoral votes along with the national popular vote. All you need is enough states to agree to have 270 votes, and boom! Popular vote wins. No, it's not going to make Hillary Clinton the president. It's really too late for that. But instead of despair and pointless petitions, you should begin acting for the future you want, today. 
As I wrote for Addicting Info, 
Eleven states have already signed on to the National Popular Vote bill, which is an interstate compact agreeing to cast the votes of those states (165 in all) to whoever wins the popular vote in the general election. If more states sign on, specifically 105 votes' worth, it's decided â€” the popular vote will determine who wins the general election. 
If you live in California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland, Washington, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Hawaii, or DC, your district is already on board with truly democratic elections. Although those states are mostly blue, not all of the legislative branches are, so there's hope! 
If you do not live in one of those states, you can pressure your state legislators to pass a bill joining the cause. You can find the progress made in your state already at this link , or find out more behind the movement in general here . 
If you don't like the fact that a Wyoming Republican's vote counts for four times as much as a Democrat's in California, see how far along your state is on accepting truly democratic elections. Don't sign a dumb petition and then forget about it.

Meet Melania Trump. America's new First Lady. It would be completely pointless to try and compare her to the eloquent Michelle Obama or any other former First Lady for that matter. The best way to get to know the wife of President-elect Donald Trump is to, well, compare her to him. 
Their differences are glaring. She is an immigrant; he hates immigrants. She speaks five languages; he's barely mastered one. But they do have a lot in common as well. Melania's father was a Communist party member; and as Putin can attest, Donald likes Communists . 
They also both really love Donald. In her speech at the Republican rally in Berwyn, Philadelphia on November 3, 2016, Melania said about Donald, 'He knows how to get things done. He certainly knows how to shake things up, doesn't he?' 
You can watch her speech here: 
Melania was apparently talking her husband's approach to politics but was she really. In 1998, at the tender age of 28, the Yugoslav-born former model, Melania Knauss, met Donald Trump at a fashion party. He was still married to Marla Maples and was on a date with another woman. He sent his date to the washroom so he could get Melania's phone number. Yep, he knows how to get 'er done in a variety of areas. 
But Melania knows how to shake things up, too. Just ask Howard Stern. In 1999, Melania participated in an on-air radio conversation with the shock jock. 
'Are you naked? Are you nude?' Howard asked Melania. 
'Almost,' she said. 
'Ahhh, I've got my pants off already,' replied Howard. 
Like her husband, she apparently loves getting her picture taken as well. You can check out some of the most un-First Lady like pictures here when Melania was profiled in 2000 by GQ. The photos were posted online again in March 2016. Included in the spread, which took place on Trump's customized Boeing 727, is Melania spread out naked on the bed. 
Air Force One â€“ here they come!

On Thursday, a senior Russian diplomat revealed that the Russian government did meet with members of Donald Trump's presidential campaign during the election. This disclosure reopens scrutiny concerning what role the Kremlin might have played in the president-elect's close and contentious race against Hillary Clinton. 
Trump repeatedly said during the campaign that he never had contact with the Russian government. 
'I can tell you I think if I came up with that they'd say, 'Oh, it's a conspiracy theory, it's ridiculous,'' Trump told CBS4's Jim DeFede during an interview at his golf resort in Doral. 'I mean I have nothing to do with Russia. I don't have any jobs in Russia. I'm all over the world but we're not involved in Russia.' 
When asked about outstanding loans with Russian banks or investors, Trump replied in July: 
'Absolutely not. It's ridiculous.' 
Meanwhile, during his campaign, Trump repeatedly refused requests to disclose his tax returns to the American people. 
Experts still speculate that Trump's tax returns could contain damaging information regarding his relationship with a foreign government or business interest. 
During an interview with Russia's state-run Interfax News, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed that 'there were contacts' with Trump's team during the election. 
'Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage,' Rybakov said. 'Those people have always been in the limelight in the United States and have occupied high-ranking positions. I cannot say that all of them but quite a few have been staying in touch with Russian representatives.' 
'We have just begun to consider ways of building dialogue with the future Donald Trump administration and channels we will be using for those purposes,' Ryabkov was quoted as saying. 
'We continue this work of course,' he added . 
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Bloomberg that it's 'normal practice' for Russian Embassy staff to meet with U.S. presidential campaigns. 
Zakharova added that Clinton rejected similar requests to meet during the campaign. 
From Moscow with love comrade Trump.

By Jameson Parker Election 2016 , Politics November 10, 2016 Obama Just Did Something To Spite Trump On The President-Elect's Very First Visit To The White House   
Nobody is more disgusted and disappointed in the election results than President Barack Obama, whose legacy of progress is poised to be undone overnight by a belligerent con man. And apparently the first meeting between current and future presidents was off to a rocky start â€“ culminating with Obama abruptly breaking with tradition and not giving Trump the satisfaction of a publicity win on this sad day. 
According to reporters at the White House , Obama cancelled a planned 'photo op' with Trump shortly after meeting him, depriving the president-elect of the chance to appear alongside the current president and gain an air of legitimacy. 
The Obamas canceled a photo-op of the current and future first couples outside the south entrance of the White House. In his first visit to the White House after the 2008 election, Mr. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama posed for the cameras alongside President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush. The decision not to participate in this tradition illustrates how bitter the campaign was, particularly for Mrs. Obama who delivered some of the most emotional arguments against electing Mr. Trump. 
It may also suggest that Obama's first meeting with Trump went about as badly as expected. The president had hoped to press Trump on the importance of governing the country with a semblance of dignity, as well as making the case that spending his first day in office signing a bunch of executive orders to erase Obama's legacy out of spite would be a horrific start to his time in office. It appears that Trump was not in the a mood to listen. 
Mr. Earnest said Mr. Obama would go through with Mr. Trump the policies he has implemented that he hopes his successor won't undo. But Mr. Trump is expected to attempt to unravel much of Mr. Obama's legacy, with plans to reverse his policies on health care, climate change, immigration and government regulations, and to dramatically shift his foreign-policy approach. 
The fact that Obama would break this tradition â€“ a symbolic gesture of the peaceful transition of power â€“ implies he is keenly aware that the man about to take over is a walking, talking disaster. A pathological liar and narcissist who has surrounded himself with a team of goons that he can count on to tell him what he wants to here and claw their way up his coattails at every chance. No photo op is going to change this tragedy from unfolding.
