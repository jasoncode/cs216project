Political discourse of American mass media is inundated with another wave of Russophobia and fear mongering. Besides the obvious military threat (Russia's nuclear arsenal), or the challenges to the US foreign policy (the conflicts in Ukraine or Syria), a new fear has been introduced into the news: the US political system is endangered by Russia's computer hacking, informational warfare, and its support of Donald Trump. 
The newspaper titles sound like a commercial for the upcoming Invasion of the Body Snatchers sequel. The Washingon Post announces: 'Russia Is Now a Threat. The US Should Treat It Like One.' Time magazine raises the stakes: 'Russia Wants to Undermine Faith in the U.S. Election.' 
The Atlantic warns of the 'The Dangers of the Putin-Trump relationship,' articulating the already familiar litany of complaints: 'Russia is directly interfering in the US elections … it is a dangerous escalation that threatens the integrity of the US electoral process.' While US Today allows notorious neocon named Max Boot to discover not just the threat, but an actual war. His 'Time to Get Real About Russia Cyber War,' is rather blunt: 'Our democracy is under attack by Russia, but almost no one is treating the situation with the gravity it deserves.' 
Well, nobody treats the situation with the gravity it deserves because they are treating it with much greater gravity. In fact, some of the commentators are so grave, that they are ready to give in already. Zack Beauchamp concludes his tirades against Russian hacking in the following manner: 'Russia's strategy is even more dangerous that it appears. Not only does it undermine democracy using the press but it actually gets the press to undermine itself. And there's not much we can reasonably do about it, either.' 
Reading all this, one might think that the former Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal , has been resurrected along with his 1949 battle-cry: 'The Russians are coming. The Russians are coming. They're right around. I've seen Russian soldiers.' 
What is behind this Russophobia? A real Russian threat? A smokescreen intended to cover failed policies of recent administration? The meeting between the Russophobic minds of a particular candidate (Hillary Clinton) and a particular group of voters (neocons)? 
I believe that these Joe McCarthy type accusations against both Russia and Trump seem to pursue only one goal: to give the veneer of respectability to the neocons' and other Republican luminaries' desertion of their own party. Thus, endless 'confessions' of reformed Republicans and hardcore neocons , expressing their born-again zeal for the Democratic Candidate, Hillary Clinton. 
The neocons are not switching parties because they've seen the light. They are enamored with Hillary Clinton's record of foreign policy and her willingness to embrace the US globalist claims. As reported by Rania Khalek in Intercept , Robert Kagan, one of the leading neocons, the co-founder of the notorious PNAC (Project for the New American Century, the blueprint of the recent policies of aggression and regime change intended to cement US hegemony in world affairs), has been on the record for quite some time: 'I would say all Republican foreign policy professionals are anti-Trump,' Kagan told …at a ' foreign policy professionals for Hillary ' fundraiser… –I would say that a majority of people in my circle will vote for Hillary.' 
The neocons are very public about their desertion, and bear it as a badge of honor. Dubious honor, since in their pursuit of an ideal candidate for their agenda, neocons do not just betray their former party, but the very foundations of American democracy: the two party system. 
Their desertion reveals that American political system has finally internalized Francis Fukuyama proud words about the end of history. We've reached the consensus; there is no need to argue or challenge, history has ended, the truths are revealed and they are now the property of the elites united into one globalist Imperial party bent on equating American prosperity with the American hegemony over world affairs. 
To any objective observer it is clear that is not Russia that endangers US democracy but the political corruption, the rule of 1% oligarchy, and mad pursuit of PNAC policies. Even greater danger to democracy lies in the neocons' desertion to the Hillary camp. 
Unsavory as the corporate rule and globalism might be, one can argue for and pursue these goals, provided they leave the room for the alternative vision. It is this neocons' dismissal of the alternatives that betrays the very foundations of democracy, at least, in the way, a political philosopher Karl Popper formulated them in his celebrated 1945 treatise, Open Society and Its Enemies . 
The list of neocons and other prominent Republicans rushing toward one party system has been compiled by Eleanor Clift in Daily Beast at the end of June, and had obviously grown since then. Some of them, Max Boot in particular, are pretty explicit about the reasons for his desertion: in his May 8, 2016, article in LA Times , Boot announces simply that, 'The Republican Party is Dead.' 
Why? Because it is no longer led by the likes of McCain, Rubio and Romney, for whom Boot served as foreign policy advisor, but by Donald Trump, 'the ignorant demagogue' intending to break up 'the most successful alliance in history — NATO.' Furthermore, Trump has 'kind words for tyrants such as Vladimir Putin.' Indeed, how can anyone in the US political establishment have kind words for Putin? We keep our kind words only for 'our SOBs.' 
The simplicity if not poverty of this argumentation makes it difficult to distinguish it from exaggerations, simplification, or ignorance, for which neocons consistently fault Trump. But neocons were never friends of irony; otherwise, they would not make statements about NATO's spectacular success with a straight face. 
The alliance that followed every whim of its paranoid members, such as Baltic Republics or Poland, and which intended to drag Ukraine into NATO pushing the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation? If this is success, how does one define failure? And talking about exaggerations: 'The risk of Trump winning, however remote, represents the biggest national security threat that the United States faces today.' 
As if being 'dead' is not bad enough, Boot feels the need to drive a stake into the heart of the Republican Party: the party is stupid . Writing for NYT , the publication that never misses a chance to print something nasty about Republicans, Boot bemoans Republican complicity with Donald Trump phenomenon: 'How the Stupid Party' Created Donald Trump.' 
Why can't there be an alternative to the neocons' doctrines of world domination in the form of a populist, nationalist movement that wants Americans to take care of Americans first, before overextending the country's economic and military reach? And should this alternative be immediately called stupid? 
Yet, for many neocons, it is Hillary or bust. James Kirchik goes out of his way trying to convince his fellow conservatives that it is Clinton who is a true conservative, and therefore, the last American hope: 'It's come to this: Hillary Clinton is the one person standing between America and the abyss.' 
Referring to a profound conservative thinker, Michael Oakeshott, Kirchik observed that Oakeshott 'defines the conservative disposition as one that 'prefers small and limited innovations to large and indefinite' ones and 'favors a slow rather than a rapid pace, and pauses to observe current consequences and make appropriate adjustments.' … Clinton is the candidate of the status quo, something that conservatives, by definition, are supposed to uphold.' 
Kirchick fails to mention, however, that it is Clintons' and Obama's implementation of neocons' policies which is nothing short of revolutionary. Military adventures, drastic regime changes, alliance redrawing, the willingness to sacrifice American lives and money in their pursuit, all these misguided policies that meet no political resistance –that's what revolutionary. 
Trump's realism and pragmatic approach to politics appears as revolutionary only to the ideologues who refuse to pause in their drive to reshape the modern world according to their childish dreams. 
This radical reworking of democratic and conservative process of slow incremental improvements into the hegemony of corporate sponsored elites is indeed revolutionary: a modern day version of Lenin's hegemony of proletariat and its avant-garde, the elite party, all over again. 
Hillary Clinton is as conservative as Brezhnev, who, in his failure to modify or change the radical agenda set up by the party of Lenin and Stalin, was indeed, a conservative. Only an intellectual of Kirchick's magnitude can see something Oakeshottian in this embrace of one party system. 
As someone who lived under one party rule in the former Soviet Union, I fully appreciate Popper's rather minimalistic, but fundamental view of democracy, as the society that boasts a two party system and which guarantees the ease of deposing a ruling party in case of its failures. 
Karl Popper insisted on the necessity and practical usefulness of the two-party system, so that the loss of power would lead to self-scrutiny and therefore improvement. While the two parties and their loyal press try to police each other, they keep each other busy, allowing the rest of the citizens to live in peace and pursue their goals without too much interference or control. 
Obviously, all this goes down the drain with the one party system of globalists and the elites, the party that mocks and dismisses as ridiculous or deplorable anyone who happens to challenge it. 
In his The Open Society and its Enemies Popper proposes a rather paradoxical, yet extremely sensible theory of a democratic society. What is important for Popper, is not the discovery of a perfect government, but a much more mundane and pragmatic question: how to avoid the blatantly bad ones. And democracy does it better than any other system. Insisting on this pragmatism, Popper highlights the following syllogism: 
And we do not base our choice on the goodness of democracy, which may be doubtful, but solely on the evilness of a dictatorship, which is certain. Not only because the dictator is bound to make bad use of his power, but because a dictator, even if he were benevolent, would rob all others of their responsibility, and thus of their human rights and duties. This is a sufficient basis for deciding in favor of democracy—that is, a rule of law that enables us to get rid of the government. No majority, however large, ought to be qualified to abandon this rule of law.' 
Popper wrote this elucidation for The Economist ; where he explains his paradoxical thought in the following manner: 
In 'The Open Society and its Enemies' I suggested that an entirely new problem should be recognized as the fundamental problem of a rational political theory… how can we best avoid situations in which a bad ruler causes too much harm? 
When we say that the best solution known to us is a constitution that allows a majority vote to dismiss the government, then we do not say the majority vote will always be right. We do not even say that it will usually be right.' 
For Popper, the two-party system is a requirement not because any of these parties possesses the truth, but because they can lose, be removed from power, and thus given a chance to think things through and improve. Consequently, it is the very possibility of losing, and therefore improving, that makes democracies dynamic and progressive: 
From the point of view of the new theory, Election day ought to be a Day of Judgment. As Pericles of Athens said in about 430 BC, 'although only a few may originate a policy, we are all able to judge it.' Of course, we may misjudge it; in fact, we often do. But if we have lived through a party's period of power and have felt its repercussions, we have at least some qualifications for judgment…In order to make a majority government probable, we need something approaching a two-party system…. for such a system encourages a continual process of self-criticism by the two parties.' 
For Popper, the two –party system is preferable since 'an inclination to self-criticism after an electoral defeat is far more pronounced in countries with a two-party system than in those where there are several parties.' It is this self-criticism of a losing party; this desire to reform and modernize that provides healthy development for democracies. 
The rule of the last two decades did not improve the economic life of the majority of Americans; in fact, it resulted in the drastic redistribution of wealth. It didn't bring peace to the world stage. In fact, we are standing on the threshold of nuclear confrontation. 
Yet, in the manner of the Germany in 1930s, we are rapidly overstepping democratic principles for the sake of one party and its global ambitions, of the consensus formulated by the PNAC, Council of Foreign Affairs, Atlantic Council, and other think tanks, along with the State Department, and the press, all of whom argue for the same policies all over again. Even now, weeks before the elections, we are reading about the same bureaucrats in Pentagon, CIA, or State Department, haggling for the place in the future Hillary cabinet. 
It is those rascals that can be sent home, who are worthy of being voted in. And conversely, it is those rascals, who want to stay in power no matter how wrongheaded, dangerous, or unpopular their policies are that should be thrown out. 
There is no absolute truth in politics, there is no end of history, and there is no one size fits all. Popper understood it much better than Fukuyama. History never ends: parties should continue to lose, and thus given a chance to come up with better policies for the next election. Only when Democratic Party is forced to take a back seat, it will contemplate on how it can improve, and offer new policies for the country. 
Propping up Hillary as the best embodiment of the failed policies, allowing the same bankers, diplomats, and generals to metastasize into next election and hold the same key positions in the Pentagon, the State Department, CIA or Treasury, is ultimately, the embrace of one party system; it provides a profound disservice to the United States and its democratic tradition. 
At the last presidential debate this electoral season, Hillary Clinton pretended to be appalled by Trump's hypothetical refusal to accept the results of the November elections. Mass media echo chambers went into the override mode bemoaning Trump's disrespect for the venerable political tradition of peaceful transition of power. Trump was never in power, however. 
What is truly appalling is the real, not the hypothetical threat of turning US into a one party system, the system which is so entrenched that it can only mock, dismiss, and conspire to denigrate its opponents. Maybe Mr. Forrestal was right after all. Russians, or rather Soviets, are here, but they do not hack the emails, they write them. Rate this:

See this screen-shot taken at 1:30 in the afternoon on November 9th, after Trump's win. They pretend Trump's win is a victory for bigots, instead of a defeat for the aristocracy ('Wall Street', 'The Establishment', or America's billionaires and their agents such as lobbyists and the leading politicians). 
However, a close look at the evidence shows Huffington Post to be wrong: Trump's win was overwhelmingly driven by Americans' repudiation of the aristocracy itself (such as, for example, repudiation of the Institute that runs Huffington Post's neoconservative international edition, World Post , the Berggruen Institute (including Eric Schmidt , Lawrence Summers , Fareed Zakaria , Arianna Huffington, Nicholas Berggruen , Ernesto Zedillo , Carl Bildt, Niall Ferguson, and Joseph Nye, all being proponents of Obama's building war against Russia — such as: 'To confront Putin, Europe will have to make changes that will be deeply controversial on a continent long committed to environmentalism and marked by an aversion to the use of force'). And, as far as global warming is concerned, which is a real problem about Trump, it's also very much and demonstrably — not merely in words — a real problem about Hillary too (and one that back in July 2015 before the Party nominees had been chosen, even was courageously reported by some of HuffPo's own reporters ), but HuffPo and other Democratic Party propagandists pretend there's reason to believe that Trump's actions would be even worse than hers have been, and HuffPo's readers thus end up being little else than Democratic Party suckers who feel satisfied in their 'news' reading to soak up what is almost entirely Democratic Party propaganda, which means the propaganda emanating out of the White House whenever a Democrat resides there — sort of like a Democratic Party version of the Republican Party's Fox 'News'. 
The aristocracy (all of it, both its Republican and its Democratic Party branches) continue their campaign, and expect to crush their opposition — the public (of all parties). And that's what a close look at the evidence shows explains Trump's win — not bigotry on the part of the American public. Bigotry is a huge problem in every society, but especially amongst the aristocracy, who love to pretend that it's mainly a problem 'down below' — so that they can continue to exploit the public while claiming to be superior to it. That's the Big Lie, which Obama and the Clintons — and Huffington Post — promote and get paid very well to promote. 
Their campaign never ends. Only the personnel do.

written by Admin by Eric Zuesse, originally posted at strategic-culture.org Before I start this condemnation of lies from 'liberal' 'news' media, I should indicate that I am a former lifelong Democrat who left the Party over the corruption of the Obama Administration when the corruption became capped by their Democratic National Committee using many devices to steal the Presidential nomination away from Bernie Sanders, to hand it to Obama's chosen successor Hillary Clinton, whom Obama expected would complete his pro-Wall-Street legacy by passing into law some version of his trade treaties and by Hillary's conquering Russia, the latter of which goal was a U.S. government project that had actually started in secret on the night of 24 February 1990 when the then-President George Herbert Walker Bush initiated what has since become a ceaseless behind-the-scenes U.S. government program to expand NATO right up to Russia's borders and ultimately to conquer Russia itself. Though the Cold War ended authentically on Russia's side in 1991, it never really did end on the U.S. side (that was just a lie) — and Obama-Clinton were hoping soon to culminate the U.S. aristocracy's conquest of Russia. I remain a committed progressive journalist but am no longer committed to any political party, because now both of the major political parties are vile and no third party in a Presidential system of government stands a realistic chance of controlling either the Executive branch or the Legislative branch of government — its only function is to serve as 'spoiler' for one or the other of the two. So: I am neither a Democrat nor a Republican, nor a supporter of some 'third' Party, but remain unchanged throughout, consistently a progressive, which means totally dedicated to truth and against lies (such as dominate all forms of conservatism). My criticisms of 'news'media reflect that, no political-party orientation. 
On November 9th, Salon's reporter Brendan Gauthier headlined Salon's top-of-homepage headline of the day, 'In Donald Trump's cabinet from hell, corporatism and cronyism run rampant — and Sarah Palin may be there, too' and reported what was at the time speculation that was sourced to an NBC news report, titled 'Gingrich, Giuliani, Priebus Eyed for Top Jobs in Trump White House: Sources' , which stated that: 
Among the names being considered, according to conversations with three campaign advisers who requested anonymity to speak freely: Rudy Giuliani for attorney general, Newt Gingrich for secretary of state, retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn for defense secretary or national security adviser, Trump finance chairman Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, and Republican National Committee finance chair Lew Eisenberg for commerce secretary. 
Trump himself has not taken an active part in transition efforts, in part out of superstition: He fears too much planning before a victory might jinx the campaign. In 2012, he was shocked to read detailed stories on Mitt Romney's preparations for the White House long before election day… 
Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, a loyal supporter, has taken a major role managing the transition effort, especially as the official transition chief, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, has drifted from the campaign… 
Asked for comment on the above names floated for cabinet posts, Trump campaign spokesman Hope Hicks replied by e-mail that 'none of this is accurate.' 
Gauthier added nothing substantial to that NBC information (of which, maybe, 'none of this is accurate') except to say such uninformative things as that Gingrich 'proved himself a rabid Trump surrogate' and as that Giuliani 'has been a tireless, if controversial, surrogate for Trump on the trail and in the media.' But in one instance Gauthier linked to a New York Post op-ed by Michael Flynn as being his source by which to allege regarding: ' Department of Defense Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn: Trump's national security adviser was fired from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, which he attributed to his hawkishness.' 
That statement about Flynn is outright false. Here is all that Flynn's op-ed — Gauthier's cited source — actually said concerning his having been fired by Obama: 
Two years ago, I was called into a meeting with the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and the director of national intelligence, and after some 'niceties,' I was told by the USDI that I was being let go from DIA. It was definitely an uncomfortable moment (I suspect more for them than me). 
I asked the DNI (Gen. James Clapper) if my leadership of the agency was in question and he said it was not; had it been, he said, they would have relieved me on the spot. 
I knew then it had more to do with the stand I took on radical Islamism and the expansion of al Qaeda and its associated movements. I felt the intel system was way too politicized, especially in the Defense Department… 
I was pissed but knew that I had maintained my integrity and was determined in the few months I had left to continue the changes I was instituting and to keep beating the drum about the vicious enemy we were facing (still are)… 
We're in a global war, facing an enemy alliance that … picks up radical Muslim countries and organizations such as Iran, al Qaeda, the Taliban and Islamic State. 
That's a formidable coalition, and nobody should be shocked to discover that we are losing the war. 
There was no indication whatsoever in the article, that Flynn had been fired on account of any 'hawkishness.' That allegation by Salon was simply fabricated. 
The reality about Flynn's firing was the exact opposite: he was too 'dovish' to suit the neoconservative Barack Obama, who was now demanding that all of his top military generals support his goal of going to war against Russia. Flynn objected to that by saying that only one war at a time makes any sense, and that this war must be the defeat of jihadists, nothing else — certainly not a war against the other nuclear superpower. 
Rather than Flynn's support of Trump being a reflection of their shared 'hawkishness', it reflects their strong belief that the view that Barack Obama holds and that Hillary Clinton holds even more strongly — that the war against jihadists must be subordinated to the war against Russia — is a totally upside-down view of the priorities, and that instead of the U.S. supporting jihadists who are warring against Russia and its allies, the U.S. ought to be supporting Russia and its allies who are warring against jihadists. 
If Salon wants to support the Obama-Clinton view and oppose the Trump view on the basis of truthful assertions, then that's journalism and it is not mere political propaganda. 
But if Salon wants to deceive its readers into holding the political viewpoint that they hold, then what else is there to call Salon but a propaganda-site?

A victory for freedom, justice and human happiness it isn't. Those currently frothing at the mouth about the dawn of a new golden age of peace and equality really should know better. A billionaire and friend of billionaires just won an election. 1789 it isn't. 
But Clinton would have blown up the world. Trump probably won't. Which makes the current situation a very tiny, possibly temporary, but still vanishingly rare moment of sanity in a largely insane world. For that small reason alone sane people everywhere should welcome it for what it is. 
So, what to make of those who don't? 
Hysteria. Fainting. Screaming. Pseudo-Leftists happy to support Obama's imperialism and domestic tyranny, beating their chests and seeking counselling for PTSD because democracy happened. 'Mass' riots of thousands (or is it only hundreds? Depends on your source) of outraged identity-politicians. 
What do these protesters think they are protesting? 
Fascism? Well, ok, but where were they during the past sixteen years during which America has been dragged by inches into becoming the proto-facist state it now is? Besides what is more fascist-populist that using riot and civil unrest to overturn a democratic vote? 
Racism? Sexism? Climate-denial? Which of these offenses is worse than nuclear war? And where is it written in the US constitution that they justify the reversal of an election? 
And what about those alt news types supporting the 'protesters'? Do they agree with Change.org that the vote should be overturned by the electoral college and Clinton given the presidency because she has a vagina and her chums can mobilise mass-hysteria? Are they basically saying they were for Hillary all along, because the Pentagon and Wall Street and WW3 are the lesser of two evils? 
If that's not what they are saying, then what? Protest needs an aim, so what is the aim here? More Obama? Martial Law? Total societal disintegration? 
All better than Trump? 
Would be great to get some feedback here. Rate this:

Alleged humanitarian efforts have always been a rather important aspect of the state propaganda campaign carried out by the White House and its media. We've seen Washington using its proxy NGOs to fight against the alleged 'humanitarian crimes' of the Syrian government, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba and other states that Washington has declared its enemies. 
This large-scale campaign that is said to be driven by 'common human values' has been supported by a number of modern American oligarchs. 
Among those 'humanitarian champions' one may find the founder of Microsoft and one of the richest businessmen in the world, Bill Gates. He is a figure who likes to be presented as a benevolent philanthropist of sorts. By using the so-called 'Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,' this American oligarch attempts to put on the mask of the official representative of the US… View original post 547
