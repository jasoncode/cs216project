The Assassination of Russia - FSB false flag bombings of 1999 https://youtu.be/y9cRoXgawVA In the fall of 1999, a wave of bloody apartment bombings swept through Russian cities, killing 293 people and causing widespread panic. Although blamed on the Chechen terrorists that the Russians were fighting in the Second Chechen War, FSB agents were caught planting the exact same type of bombs as in the other blasts later that month. The government claimed that the bomb was part of a security exercise and Vladimir Putin came to power as the next Russian President on the back of the terror wave later that year. http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a092299ryazanbomb#a092299ryazanbomb On the evening of September 22, 1999, several residents of an apartment block in Ryazan, a city about a hundred miles south of Moscow, observe three strangers at the entrance of their building. The two young men and a woman are carrying large sacks into the basement. The residents notice that the carÂ’s plate has been partially covered with paper, although they can still see a Moscow license plate number underneath. They decide to call the local police. After several bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow earlier in the month (see September 9, 1999 and September 13, 1999), their vigilance is understandable. When the police arrive, around 9:00 p.m., they uncover what appears to be huge bomb: three sacks of sugar filled with a granular powder, connected to a detonator and a timing device set for 5:30 a.m. The bomb squad uses a gas testing device to confirm that it is explosive material: it appears to be hexagen, the military explosive that is believed to have been used to blow up two Moscow blocks. The residents are evacuated. Then the bomb carted away and turned over to the FSB. (In an apparent oversight, the FSB fails to collect the detonator, which is photographed by the local police.) The following morning, September 23, the government announces that a terrorist attack has been averted. They praise the vigilance of the local people and the Ryazan police. Police comb the city and find the suspectsÂ’ car. A telephone operator for long-distance calls reports that she overheard a suspicious conversation: the caller said there were too many police to leave town undetected and was told, Â“Split up and each of you make your own way out.Â” To the policeÂ’s astonishment, the number called belongs to the FSB. Later this day, the massive manhunt succeeds: the suspects are arrested. But the police are again stunned when the suspects present FSB credentials. On MoscowÂ’s orders, they are quietly released. On September 24, the government reverses itself and now says the bomb was a dummy and the whole operation an exercise to test local vigilance. The official announcement is met with disbelief and anger. Ryazan residents, thousands of whom have had to spend the previous night outdoors, are outraged; local authorities protest that they were not informed. However, the suspicion of a government provocation is not widely expressed and press coverage fades after a few days. It is only several months later that an investigation by the independent weekly Novaya Gazeta re-ignites the controversy (see February 20, 2000 and Fall 1999). The governmentÂ’s explanations will fail to convince skeptics (see March 23, 2000). The Ryazan incident later becomes the main reason for suspecting the government of having orchestrated previous bombings. The controversy is then widely reported in the international press.

On September 22, 1999, a bomb was discovered in the city of Ryazan, about 100 miles south of Moscow. After the chief bomb suspects were discovered to be FSB agents, the government claimed the bomb was a dummy and the incident was a training exercise (see September 22-24, 1999). But the bomb-squad officer, Yuri Tkachenko, is adamant that it was a professionally-prepared, military-style bomb. He defends the accuracy of his sophisticated gas-testing device which identified the explosives as hexogen. The article provokes much comment in Russia but is ignored by the government.

[Source: Terror99.ru]A team of FSB officials, led by Alexander Zdanovich, agrees to a televised meeting with angry and suspicious residents of Ryazan, hoping to put down rumors of a government provocation and shore up the credibility of the official account. In September 1999 a bomb was found in the basement of a building in Ryazan and the people arrested for planting the bomb were discovered to be FSB agents. The government then claimed the incident was merely a training exercise, but residents suspect the FSB wanted to bomb the building to create a fake terrorist incident (see September 22-24, 1999). Zdavonich apologizes for the inconvenience suffered by Ryazan inhabitants but then suggests the renewed interest in the event is a campaign ploy: Â“For months, there was no interest and there were no publications. The theme was activated on the eve of the presidential election with the most fantastic details in order to accuse the FSB of planning a real explosion with the death of people. This is actively used in the political struggle.Â” (The presidential election is only one week away.) A soldier named Alexei Pinyaev has claimed that he worked at a nearby base where hexogen was reportedly kept in sacks marked Â“sugarÂ” (see Fall 1999). The commander of the base denies that there was any soldier named Pinyaev, but the Novaya Gazeta reporter who had found Pinyaev then shows pictures of him and plays a recording of his interview. The FSB will not let its three agents appear in public or allow journalists to interview them. The broadcast does not allow any discussion of a possible connection between the Ryazan incident and the apartment bombings in Moscow earlier that month (see September 9, 1999 and September 13, 1999). The FSB officials did not have good explanations for the fact that local authorities, including its own FSB office in Ryazan, were not informed of the supposed exercise, or for the lack of medical resources for the thousands of people forced to spend the night outdoors. According to David Satter, a long-time correspondent in Moscow for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times who believes the Ryazan incident was a failed provocation, the broadcast only serves to increase the publicÂ’s misgivings.

Chekulin says the FSB suppressed a governmental investigation into the scheme. Â“I am sure the bombings were organized by the FSB,Â” Berezovsky declares.

Zero Hedge October 26, 2016 
In the latest revelation sure to reignite accusations of collusion between the Clinton campaign and the DOJ, among the recent batch of hacked emails released by Wikileaks, we learn that the day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, Hillary's campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik , who is currently a top official at the US Justice Department serving as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs. 
Peter Kadzik, with lobbyist Tony Podesta, brother of John Podesta . 
The post-Benghazi dinner was attended by Podesta, Kadzik, superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other well-placed Beltway fixtures. The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the Wikileaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant. The dinner was set for 7:30 that evening, just one day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee . 
Podesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podesta's home, another email shows . Another email sent on May 5, 2015 , Kadzik's son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
As the Daily Caller notes , the dinner arrangement 'is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state's email practices.' As one former U.S. Attorney tells told the DC, the exchanges are another example of the Clinton campaign's 'cozy relationship' with the Obama Justice Department. 
The hacked emails confirm that Podesta and Kadzik were in frequent contact. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta's birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik's son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
'The political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I don't think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server,' says Matthew Whitaker, the executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a government watchdog group. 
' It's the kind of thing the American people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of Hillary Clinton ,' he added, comparing the Podesta-Kadzik meetings to the revelation that Attorney General Loretta Lynch met in private with Bill Clinton at the airport in Phoenix days before the FBI and DOJ investigating Hillary Clinton. 
Kadzik's role at the DOJ, where he started in 2013, is particularly notable Kadzik, as helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. 
A Long, Friendly History 
Podesta and Kadzik have a long history, one which has surprisingly gone mostly unnoticed during the ongoing Clinton email scandal. As DC helps summarize, Kadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. 
That history is cited by Podesta in another email hacked from his Gmail account. In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a 'fantastic lawyer' who ' kept me out of jail.' 
As the DC Chuck Ross notes, it is unclear to which case Podesta was referring and whether he was joking about prison. But Podesta was caught in a sticky situation in both the Lewinsky affair and the Rich pardon scandal. As deputy chief of staff to Clinton in 1996, Podesta asked then-United Nations ambassador Bill Richardson to hire the 23-year-old Lewinsky . In April 1996, the White House transferred Lewinsky from her job as a White House intern to the Pentagon in order to keep her and Bill Clinton separate. But the Clinton team also wanted to keep Lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with Clinton. 
Richardson later recounted in his autobiography that he offered Lewinsky the position but that she declined it. 
Podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for the investigation. But he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from Clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. 'He did lie to me,' Podesta said about Clinton in a National Public Radio interview in 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in Feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Lewinsky probe. Kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky, represented Podesta through the fiasco. 
Podesta had been promoted to Clinton's chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. 
Kadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that 'Kadzik was recruited into Marc Rich's lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.' 
The report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Rich's pardon. 
On top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Rich's ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library. 
Kadzik's current role 
In his current role as head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Kadzik handles inquiries from Congress on a variety of issues. In that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the Clinton investigation. The Justice Department and FBI have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in July with no charges filed against Clinton. 
But Kadzik worked on other Clinton email issues in his dealings with Congress. Last November, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation . 
In a Feb. 1, 2016 letter in response to Kadzik, Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis noted that Kadzik had explained 'that special counsel may be appointed at the discretion of the Attorney General when an investigation or prosecution by the Department of Justice would create a potential conflict of interest.' 
DeSantis, a Republican, suggested that Lynch's appointment by Bill Clinton in 1999 as U.S. Attorney in New York may be considered a conflict of interest. He also asserted that Obama's political appointees '” a list which includes Kadzik '” 'are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as Department of Justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. ' 
It is unknown if Kadzik responded to DeSantis' questions. 
Kadzik's first involvement in the Clinton email brouhaha came in a Sept. 24, 2015 response letter to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley in which he declined to confirm or deny whether the DOJ was investigating Clinton. Last month, Politico reported that Kadzik angered Republican lawmakers when, in a classified briefing, he declined to say whether Clinton aides who received DOJ immunity were required to cooperate with congressional probes. 
Kadzik also testified at a House Oversight Committee hearing last month on the issue of classifications and redactions in the FBI's files of the Clinton email investigation. This article was posted: Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 9:52 am Share this article

Scientists have heard hugely unusual messages from deep in space that they think are coming from aliens. 
A new analysis of strange modulations in a tiny set of stars appears to indicate that it could be coming from extraterrestrial intelligence that is looking to alert us to their existence. 
The new study reports the finding of specific modulations in just 234 out of the 2.5 million stars that have been observed during a survey of the sky. The work found that a tiny fraction of them seemed to be behaving strangely. 
And there appears to be no obvious explanation for what is going on, leaving the scientists behind the paper to conclude that the messages are coming from aliens. This article was posted: Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 9:30 am Share this article

Senior White House officials blocked the Navy from conducting needed freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea amid growing concerns that China is militarizing newly reclaimed islands, according to the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board. 
A working paper produced in September 2015 by John Hamre, the policy board chairman, called for an immediate resumption of Navy warship passages to prevent China from taking over the strategic Southeast Asian waterway. 
The internal document was disclosed Monday by WikiLeaks as part of its latest batch of hacked emails from the account of John Podesta, campaign chairman for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The Obama administration has accused 'Russia's senior-most officials' of hacking and leaking the emails posted to WikiLeaks and other sites in order to influence the 2016 election. 
The document was labeled 'Chairman's Working Notes of the Defense Policy Board '“ Chinese Island-Building in the South China Sea.' It was sent to Jake Sullivan, the Clinton campaign's senior policy adviser, by Stuart Eizenstat, a Defense Policy Board member who was advising the campaign on internal Pentagon deliberations.

Top NATO & EU officials expressed anger at Spain's permit reportedly issued to a Russian aircraft carrier group to take on fuel and supplies at Ceuta, a city with unclear political status. Spain says Russia's warships have been mooring there 'for years.' 
A barrage of harsh statements followed when Spanish media reported that Russia's naval battle group led by aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov would make a stopover at the autonomous port of Ceuta after passing the Straits of Gibraltar on Wednesday. 
Battle Stations! Putin's fearsome fleet locked, loaded & ready for war with Britain'¦ or not 
Russian ships would moor in Ceuta to take on fuel and supplies under a permit issued by Spain's Foreign Ministry, Spanish newspaper ABC reported on Tuesday, also citing Defense Minister Pedro Morenes, who said that 'there was a prior authorization for this particular case.' 
Guy Verhofstadt, former Belgian prime minister and currently EU envoy for Brexit talks with the UK, expressed his outrage, calling Spain's decision 'the harassment of EU and NATO forces.' 
In a Facebook post, he said that NATO member Spain 'provides assistance to a fleet which has one purpose,' adding that 'only last week this Spanish Government signed up to a statement from the European Council accusing Russia of war crimes against civilians in Aleppo.' 
Later in the day, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg made it clear that the bloc wants Madrid to rethink the stopover permit. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
'We are concerned and I have expressed that very clearly about potential use of this battle group to increase Russia's ability and to be a platform for airstrikes against Syria,' he said. 
'This is something I have conveyed very clearly before and I repeat those concerns today and I believe that all NATO allies are aware that this battle group can be used to conduct airstrikes against Aleppo and Syria.' 
He then downplayed the rhetoric, noting that 'it's for each nation to decide whether these ships can get supplies and be fuelled in different harbors along the route towards the eastern Mediterranean.' 
Late Tuesday night, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said it was 'reviewing' the decision. 'The latest stopover requests are being reviewed at the moment based on the information we are receiving from our allies and from Russian authorities,' the ministry said in a statement, quoted by Reuters. 
Earlier in the day, however, the ministry told RIA Novosti that Madrid allows Russian ships to dock in Spanish ports as 'routine navigation' which effectively lies outside EU sanctions imposed on Moscow. 
In the meantime, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry told the Telegraph the requests from the Russian Navy 'are considered on case-by-case basis,' stressing that 'Russian navy vessels have been making calls in Spanish ports for years.' 
Ceuta, an autonomous Spanish enclave on the tip of Africa's northern coast, lies along the Straits of Gibraltar and borders Morocco, which also claims the territory as its own. 
Although Ceuta is part of the EU, its status within NATO is still unresolved. Since 2011, Spain has rankled the bloc by allowing 57 Russian warships to refuel at the enclave. 
The mission of the Admiral Kuznetsov carrier group has already triggered a media frenzy across Europe, with British, Norwegian, and Dutch navies sending frigates and surveillance vessels to shadow the Russian warships as they round European shores through international waters. 
Once they reach Syrian shores, the ships will provide backup for Russia's naval standing group already deployed to the area, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. This article was posted: Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 6:21 am Share this article

Around 300 civilians were killed in eleven airstrikes conducted by the US-led coalition in Syria, which Amnesty International investigated for its latest report. Amnesty says the US must come clean about the civilian toll of its fight against Islamic State. 
Amnesty suspects that US Central Command (CENTCOM), which directs coalition airstrikes in Syria, 'may have'¦ carried out unlawful attacks' in Syria, failing to take necessary measures to prevent civilian killings. 
'We fear the US-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria,' said Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for Research at Amnesty International's Beirut regional office. 
'It's high time the US authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria. Independent and impartial investigations must be carried out into any potential violations of international humanitarian law and the findings should be made public.' 
Amnesty investigated evidence, including eyewitness accounts, reports by human rights organizations and the media, photographs and video footage as well as satellite imagery, related to 11 suspected coalition attacks in Syria. The group estimates that the attacks have claimed as many as 300 civilian lives. So far none of these deaths has been acknowledged by CENTCOM. 
The report published on Wednesday added that the total civilian death toll from coalition action 'could be as high as 600 or more than 1,000' since the operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL) started in Syria in 2014. 
One of the strikes investigated by Amnesty took place in the early hours of December 7, 2015. The attacks hit two houses in the village of Ayn al-Khan, near al-Hawl in al-Hasakah governorate in northern Syria, killing 40 civilians, including 19 children, and injuring at least 30 others, the report said. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
According to an eyewitness account, an initial night strike was followed by a second attack from a helicopter gunship, which hit first responders trying to dig out survivors. 
'At this point I had a two-month-old baby boy in my arms whom I had rescued. The hit caused me to fall and drop him'¦ I fell into the hole made by the air strike. That was what saved me'¦ My mother, aunt, wife and children '“ a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed. The woman and her son who I'd rescued were killed. Everyone but me was killed,' the survivor said. 
The strike is believed to have targeted IS fighters. But local Kurdish militia reportedly warned the coalition that there were civilians in the area. 
Amnesty said CENTCOM's failure to acknowledge civilian deaths in Syria, as well as the poor record of investigating such incidents in Afghanistan and Iraq, poses grave concerns over the toll which the civilian population of Mosul, Iraq is likely to face from the ongoing operation to take the city from IS. The US-led coalition is providing air support for the offensive. 
'Given the likely increase in air strikes by the US-led Coalition as part of the Iraqi offensive to recapture Mosul, it is even more pressing that CENTCOM be fully transparent about the impact of their military actions on civilians. And it is crucial that they adhere scrupulously to international humanitarian law, including by taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and to minimize harm to civilian homes and infrastructure,' said Maalouf. 
A similar operation to capture Manbij, Syria, which is far smaller than Mosul, killed more than 200 civilians, Amnesty estimated. 
Last week, Amnesty International blasted Russia for civilian deaths in Aleppo. The Syrian city is divided between government forces and various armed groups, including the Al-Qaeda offshoot Al-Nusra Front. Russia says that the militants use civilians as human shields and would not allow them to leave the city, derailing several attempts by Russia to open humanitarian corridors out of the city.

Mr Hollande also spoke harshly about senior politicians in the book, which was released just as he intended to make public his desire to run for the presidency again in 2017. 
He blamed US President Barack Obama for creating ISIS saying: 'I don't know what would have happened if we had carried out strikes. What I can say is that we did not carry out strikes, and there's Daesh.' 
Now party members are giving up on the leader following the hapless blunder.

An editor of Austria's largest paper, Kronen Zeitung, is to be tried for hate speech over a commentary he wrote about the migrant crisis last year. 
On 25 October 2015, Christoph Biro wrote of the masses of migrants who were travelling through the Styrian countryside and remarked on the assaults and property damage committed by migrants, reports Kurier . 
Calling the majority of the migrants 'testosterone-driven Syrians', Mr. Biro recounted the multiple reports of migrants carrying out, in his words, 'extremely aggressive sexual assaults'. 
He also detailed Afghan men had slashed the seats of the trains that were transporting them to Germany because they refused to sit where Christians had previously sat. This article was posted: Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 6:12 am Share this article

Samantha Bee is proof positive that being funny, clever, or photogenic are no longer requirements in leftist media. I guess we can call that progress. Problem is, whatever the size of Bee's audience, there is still an audience. Which she lied to. Par for the course in leftist circles, but this one needs a rebuttal. Samantha Bee said 'Partial birth abortion' is not a thing, while she ranted and raved at Donald Trump for his comments in the final debate . Sorry, Sammy. Partial birth abortion is sadly a thing'¦ 
Here's what I find interesting: Bee's need to explain away partial birth abortion shows just how unpopular the procedure is. She's trying to get rid of it. Not unlike a woman hoping to chop shop her unborn baby . Of course she stops short of saying 'it's a heinous, evil thing for people to do to their own children,' by excusing the sick, evil, twisted women (and the 'doctors' who perform the butchery) who make it happen. Sorry, there is no reason to suck the brains out of a partially born baby for the 'health of the mother,' or 'if the baby has a terminal disease.' 
Abortion is always wrong. Like, always. 
Because chopping up a baby while it's partially hanging out of the mother, its head still in the birth canal, because it's 'going to die anyway' makes sense. If you agree with killing a baby like this, for any reason, you're sick. Probably a little bit evil. Read Dear Evil Women Who Abort their Babies'¦ Yep, that was written for you abortion supporters. Not sorry. You might also like Dear Liberal Women: No, Getting an Abortion is Not 'Brave''¦ This article was posted: Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 6:07 am Share this article

The Daily Sheeple October 26, 2016 
Wikileaks continues to be a treasure trove of info about the behind-the-scenes rigging of what is turning out to be the most infamous presidential election in American history. 
Remember the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and the conspiracy surrounding 'podiumgate' ? 
Hillary required a specially built podium under the pretext that she didn't want to appear shorter than Trump. 
After the debate was over, however, a sneaky 'cleaner man' was caught on tape approaching Hillary's podium multiple times, removing various items and looking as shady as possible while doing it. What could also clearly be seen was what appeared to be a lit screen dimming specifically in her podium and not in Trump's just after the debate officially ended. 
This led to lots of speculation on whether or not Hillary cheated during the first debate against Trump and other debates as well, having her comments fed to her. 
Well, if the Wikileaks Podesta emails are any indication, it's very possible. Why? A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
Because apparently Hillary can't give long speeches without a podium. 
In fact, these emails (and this isn't even all of them, but enough for you to get the picture) prove her team is well aware of the fact that everything has to be kept 'short and sweet' unless Hillary has a podium. 
So how are we supposed to believe she was able to speak at the 90-minutes debates without prepared notes being fed to her somehow? 
Especially that final debate where she appeared to be reading more than writing, looking down all the time at some sort of lit screen embedded in the podium as pointed out in other debates, as shown in the video above.

Bureaucrat who said 'stupidity' of Americans helped get law passed doubles down 
Paul Joseph Watson Prison Planet.com October 26, 2016 
Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber '“ the bureaucrat who once bragged that the 'stupidity' of the American people was crucial for passing the health care law in the first place '“ told CNN that the 'fix' for Obamacare was to impose a 'larger mandate penalty'. CNN's CAROL COSTELLO: 'So let's talk about how exactly you can fix Obamacare. I just need you to be specific because I think people really want answers. So Hillary Clinton says she can fix Obamacare. So what would one fix that would drive premiums down?' JONATHAN GRUBER: 'Look, once again, there's no sense it has to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think, probably the most important things experts would agree on is we need a larger mandate penalty''¦ Gruber's arrogance is incredible. Even after the Obama administration acknowledged that premiums are set to skyrocket next year, Gruber thinks that the answer is to financially punish Americans to an even greater degree. Gruber is essentially admitting that Obamacare is designed to make Americans destitute. 'ObamaCare was never designed *not* to overwhelm you with the shifting of massive costs. ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs,' points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments shouldn't come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people. A series of videos that emerged in 2014 featured Gruber admitting that Obamacare was deceptively crafted in order to fool 'stupid' Americans into not realizing that it would mean massive price hikes and that the law's 'lack of transparency (was) a huge political advantage' in selling it.

Â« on: Today at 05:27:09 PM Â» I live in Texas, and the news now is that this may be a "swing state":"If nothing else has driven home exactly how weird this election is, this should do it: RealClearPolitics has found that Texas is an electoral toss up. Texas, the blood-red, deeply conservative bastion of all things far right, is a statistical dead heat between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton." http://thedailybanter.com/2016/10/texas-swing-state/ Just search "Texas Swing State" for lots of articles on this. The one above shows Clinton at 46% and Trump at 45%. I call BS. There is no way, no way in hell, that Bill Clinton's wife and a pig in her own right is within single digits of Donald Trump in Texas. But that doesn't mean that there won't be an attempt to steal the state's electoral votes. I knew a couple of months ago, when elitist mouthpiece Rush Limbaugh said it was a "one-point race in Texas," that we were being psychologically prepped for the flipping of the state from Republican to Democrat.It could be that we're about to see a sleight-of-hand trick on election night. While all attention is fixed on Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and the other swing states, lo and behold, Hillary won Texas!Awarding her the state would have two benefits. First, she'd get our 38 electoral votes, second, any "secession" talk would be scrapped. How could we justify secession, since we voted for Hillary?Anyway, we're watching you, DNC. Keep your hands off our electoral votes. Logged

One of Norway's nuclear reactors was discovered to be leaking radioactive iodine Monday morning, according to the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA). [1] 
In a statement released today, the NRPA said: 
'The radioactive leak was due to a technical failure during treatment of the fuel in the reactor hall. Emissions are low.' 
Experts say contamination levels around the Institute for Energy Technology, in the southern town of Halden, were well within legal limits and posed no risk to the public. 
Said Per Strand, deputy director-general at the NRPA, a government regulator: 
'Of course it's an unfortunate situation but there is a low environmental risk. This is not the sort of leak we want.' [2] 
The radioactive iodine was a byproduct of the uranium which powers the facility. 
Staff were evacuated from the institute, but later returned, donning protective gear, to assess the cause and extent of the leak, and halt it. 
A senior NRPA official said the incident would 'maybe' be rated a 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale, which rates nuclear incidents from 1 to 7. By comparison, the incidents at Fukishima and Chernobyl were ranked 7. [3] Source: The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
Regulatory officials were frustrated that they were not notified about the leak until today . Atle Valseth, a research director at the Institute for Energy Technology, agreed. He said: 
'I don't sit so close to those decisions but I think we should have informed the authority yesterday. We will have to go through why it wasn't reported '” it wasn't good enough that we didn't report it yesterday.' [2] 
Strand, the head of safety, preparedness and environment at the NRPA, expressed the regulator's frustration. 
'We need to gather more information '¦ But we are not happy with the situation, that we were not warned immediately. We will investigate further.' [3] 
The Swiss Radiation Safety Authority (SRSA) said i t has not detected any radiation emanating from the facility, which sits close to the Swiss border. 
Mark Foreman, a nuclear expert at the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, stressed that the vast majority of the radioactive iodine is trapped inside the fuel, which is contained within a ceramic material. The ceramic-wrapped material is stored inside a metal tube that is welded shut. The tube is inside the reactor. 
The iodine would have to leak out of the reactor to enter the reactor hall.

10-26-16 In September 2015, at the behest of its legitimate government, Russia began aerial operations to combat ISIS and al-Nusra terrorists in Syria. Numerous other likeminded groups are involved, just as cutthroat, just as ruthless, just as extremist, masquerading as Â“moderate rebelsÂ” when none exist - supported by Washington, NATO, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, other Gulf States, Jordan, Israel and Turkey.TheyÂ’re massacring civilians, killing government soldiers defending them, using chemical and other banned weapons, committing gruesome atrocities.Why does Russia pretend conflict is civil when Syria was invaded by terrorists, imported from scores of countries, serving as US imperial foot soldiers? Why does it pretend Â“moderateÂ” fighters are involved when none exist? Why does it insist on separating nonexistent Â“moderatesÂ” from terrorist groups itÂ’s combating when all anti-government forces are the same?Why isnÂ’t it targeting all armed groups wanting Assad toppled and Syrian sovereign independence destroyed? ItÂ’s the only way to free the country from the scourge its facing - supported by Washington and its rogue allies, NATO and regional ones.Why did it halt its aerial operations to liberate eastern Aleppo, declaring a unilateral ceasefire, a so-called humanitarian pause - a major blunder, accomplishing nothing? Ongoing since October 18, itÂ’s letting US-supported terrorists infesting the city replenish their ranks, regroup and mobilize for heavy attacks, largely harming civilians Moscow says it wants protected.Last Saturday evening, Russia ended its humanitarian pause because US-supported terrorists in eastern Aleppo prevent civilians from leaving, holding thousands hostage as human shields, including the sick and wounded.Yet it ceased aerial attacks, yielding the advantage to dark forces itÂ’s sworn to eliminate. What kind of strategy gives them the upper hand? It gets worse.On October 26, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov issued the following statement:Â“The Russian Aerospace Forces and the Syrian Air Force have been sticking to a moratorium on air strikes for the past eight days. They are staying out of a 10-km (six-mile) zone around Aleppo.Â”Â“Six humanitarian corridors, field kitchens and first aid stations are open for civilians leaving eastern Aleppo 24 hours a day.Â”Â“Russia and the Syrian government are ready to resume Â‘humanitarian pausesÂ’ in Aleppo if they receive guarantees from international organizations confirming readiness to evacuate the sick and the wounded as well as civilian population from the rebel-held areas.Â”Fact: Maintaining an airstrike moratorium aids Washington, its rogue allies and terrorists in eastern Aleppo they support.Fact: What good are humanitarian corridors if eastern Aleppo residents are prevented from using them, risking death or serious injury if they try.Fact: International organizations have no control over terrorists in eastern Aleppo - or anywhere else in the country. So what good are their Â“guaranteesÂ” if made?Fact: As long as Russia continues making the same mistakes repeatedly, the struggle to liberate Syria will likely go on interminably without resolution - a forever war, while countless thousands more civilians will die, be seriously injured and endure hardships people in Western societies canÂ’t imagine, victims of US imperial ruthlessness.A handful of eastern Aleppo civilians alone escaped via a humanitarian corridor. According to one now free, their relatives were seized, imprisoned and tortured.The only way to liberate thousands of others is by relentlessly smashing their terrorist captors, eliminating them - not giving them breathing room to mobilize for greater attacks.Washington is delighted with MoscowÂ’s ceasefire and humanitarian pause, serving US imperial interests, State Department spokesman admiral John Kirby saying:Â“We welcome the stated intention to extend this pause, and we hope that this extension will be more successful than it has been thus farÂ” - meaning the longer it continues, the greater the benefit to US-led dark forces, the worse off trapped Syrians in eastern Aleppo will be, the longer the struggle to liberate Syria will go on.Stephen Lendman lives in Chicago.

Re: WINDOWS 10 Â« Reply #91 on: November 17, 2015, 01:37:05 PM Â» nVidia even admitted that they intentionally cripple Linux drivers to put performance under Linux the same as performance under Windows.Clips its own product's wings to please MicrosoftBy Chris MerrimanMon Oct 07 2013, 15:28 CHIP DESIGNER Nvidia has revealed that it crippled its Linux driver to ensure parity with Windows.According to a forum poster at the Nvidia Developer Zone , the v310 version of the drivers for Basemosaic has reduced the number of monitors a user can connect simultaneously to three.The firm's reply to the post was the type of dismissive response that the Linux community has come to expect in its dealings with Nvidia.Nvidia said, "For feature parity between Windows and Linux we set Basemosaic to [three] screens."So let's be clear about this. Nvidia has chosen to remove functionality from a Linux driver to ensure that it isn't more capable than the Windows version. This really doesn't sound like the action of a company that wants to get along well with Linux developers and users. So far, Nvidia hasn't indicated whether this is a temporary situation, or more likely a permanent arrangement.There can be one of two obvious motives for this, which amount to two sides of the same coin. Either Nvidia doesn't want to be seen to show up an embarrassing limitation in Windows or the Windows driver, or the continuing acrimony between the graphics firm and Linux is not over yet.While for most users three monitors are ample, making this a fairly niche problem, it's an example of a company manipulating the marketplace. Of course controlling the flow of progress in order to sell another product is nothing new - video games makers have been doing that since the 1980s.But to control the flow of progress to favour one platform over another is playing "technology god" and sets a disturbing precedent.

Â« Reply #528 on: April 07, 2015, 07:16:45 PM Â» Fukushima disaster caused at least 1,232 fatalities last year as radiation death rate accelerates 7 April 2015 , by David Gutierrez (Natural News)According to the most recent report, deaths in Japan attributable to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster have continued to increase. Last year, the number of deaths increased by 18% over the year before.A March 2011 earthquake and tsunami triggered multiple meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on Japan's northeast coast, in what has become the worst nuclear disaster in history. A massive radioactive plume was released by the meltdowns, and the crippled plant has continued to leak radiation into the surrounding environment, including into the Pacific Ocean.A total of about 160,000 people were evacuated as a result of the Fukushima disaster. More fatalities on the horizon? According to data collected by the Fukushima Prefecture, 2014 saw 1,232 nuclear-related deaths. The two towns with the greatest number of deaths were both near the Fukushima plant: Namie, with 359 dead; and Tomioka, with 291 dead.The term "nuclear-related" means a death that does not result directly from radiation exposure but is caused by a disease later caused by that exposure. Indeed, it is radiation-related diseases -- including cancer, tumors and genetic damage -- that often cause the bulk of health problems and fatalities in cases of radiation exposure.One of the diseases particularly expected to show an uptick after the Fukushima disaster is thyroid cancer, because radioactive iodine from nuclear disasters tends to concentrate in the thyroid gland. An estimated 6,000 children contracted thyroid cancer following the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. It typically takes four to five years for most nuclear-related thyroid cancers to manifest, and as that window approaches many Fukushima parents believe that their children are already showing symptoms. Fukushima officials have tested approximately 300,000 children and have turned up 100 cases of the disease, in contrast to the pre-disaster rate of one or two per million children.One parent concerned about her child's thyroid cancer risk is Megumi Muto. Muto's daughter, Nana, has been diagnosed with lumps in her thyroid gland, and the lumps are growing. Muto is certain that the tumors were caused by Nana's exposure to Fukushima radiation."I feel angry," Muto said. "I think the authorities hide the real dangers and now many more children are being diagnosed."The health of both of Muto's children has deteriorated after being exposed to the radioactive fallout, she said."They had rashes on their bodies then nose bleeds. My son's white cells have decreased and they both have incredible fatigue," she said. "They may not have cancer now but they both have multiple nodules around their thyroids. I'm really worried." Residents suing government Muto and about 100 other Fukushima residents are currently suing the local and national governments, alleging that the governments failed to protect their children during the nuclear disaster.This sentiment was echoed in a recent report, released by a parliamentary panel, which said that the Fukushima incident was, in part, a "man-made disaster" caused by "government, regulatory authorities and Tokyo Electric Power Company," which were all lacking in "a sense of responsibility to protect people's lives and society."Because they do not trust the government's number, Muto and her fellow plaintiffs have conducted their own tests of the radiation levels in their neighborhoods. One test, conducted near a school in Fukushima city, registered radiation levels nearly 100 times that found in Tokyo.Those levels are high enough to warrant investigation, said plaintiff Sumio Konno, who has been a nuclear engineer for 29 years."I have to investigate and inform the public of the facts, that is why I have become one of the plaintiffs of the court cases," Konno said. "They're still not decontaminating areas where children live or near schools, even after four years." Sources:

Video out of Florida shows a panicked Clinton aide rush to her side in order to help her climb one step. 
When the aide sees Her Hagliness is going to reach a small riser before him, he's seen making a mad dash towards her. Hillary then turns, grabs his hand for balance and while clutching him for dear life manages to tackle the one step before her. 
You have to wonder what made him so panicked. Did she collapse once again in secret? This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 5:37 am Share this article

Economic Collapse October 27, 2016 
Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th? Let's hope that it doesn't happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. 
If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. 
At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned 'about the possibility of violence' on election day'¦ 
A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are 'very concerned.' Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are 'very confident' about that. 
More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they won't recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn't have won fair and square. 
But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trump's star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax'¦ 
Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. 
And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trump's star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June '¦ 
This is of course not the first time the GOP candidate's star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trump's star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trump's star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. 
We have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted 'Nazi Republicans get out of town or else' along with a swastika. 
There have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece'¦ 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, 'Why can't they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?' 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. 'The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by 'some thugs' that a barmaid called out from the back.' Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a 'Blue Lives Matter' shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a 'Make America Great Again' baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Let's certainly hope that we don't see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. 
Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. 
For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is 'grabbing my musket' if Donald Trump loses the election'¦ 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, 'On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. You in?' 
And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today '¦ 
'Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, I've been buying a lot more ammunition,' says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigan's Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to 'declare martial law and take our guns away' after the election. 
Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. 
Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . 
If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton's political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. 
And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month '¦ 
As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. 
But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . 
Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. 
Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it.  50

Won't you take pity on this poor, innocent little child? 
This image of a '16-year-old' migrant crying '“ which is currently plastered on the front page of The Guardian '“ is nothing short of laughable. 
'A 16-year-old from Ethiopia cries while he awaits registration at a processing centre in the makeshift refugee camp near Calais,' the photo's caption reads. The image is placed under a headline reading: 'Councils resist pressure to take children from Calais.' 

This crying 'child' is supposed to make Brits feel guilty and demand their government allow 'children' like him into their nation. 
The image is not a fake, nor is it being used satirically. It comes from the Associated Press' Emilio Morenatti , you can see four pictures of the man for sale on their website . 
The 'child migrant' is clearly in his 40's, yet their editors evidently believe their readers are so incredibly stupid they'll actually believe they're looking at a 16-year-old boy.

The Vatican includes high-ranking dignitaries, priests, nuns, and guards as well as about 3,000 lay workers who comprise the majority of the work force. The Holy See's diplomatic history began in the fourth century, but the boundaries of the papacy's temporal power have shifted over the centuries. From the 8th century through the middle of the 19th century, the Popes held sway over the Papal States, which included a broad band of territory across central Italy. In 1860, after prolonged civil and regional unrest, Victor Emmanuel's army seized the Papal States, leaving only Rome and surrounding coastal regions under papal control. In 1870, Victor Emmanuel captured Rome itself and declared it the new capital of Italy, ending papal claims to temporal power. Pope Pius IX and his successors disputed the legitimacy of these acts and proclaimed themselves to be "prisoners" in the Vatican. Finally, in 1929, the Italian Government and the Holy See signed three agreements resolving the dispute: A treaty recognizing the independence and sovereignty of the Holy See and creating the State of the Vatican City; A concordat defining the relations between the government and the church within Italy; and A financial convention providing the Holy See with compensation for its losses in 1870. A revised concordat, altering the terms of church-state relations, was signed in 1984.

Another reason as to why Ryan tried to sabotage Trump's campaign? 
Paul Joseph Watson Prison Planet.com October 27, 2016 Hillary Clinton's campaign circulated the name of one of Paul Ryan's relatives as a potential Supreme Court pick, suggesting a conflict of interest that could feed in to the Republican Speaker of the House's dislike for Donald Trump. An email released in part 19 of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features an article sent by Hillary advisor Sara Solow to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and Hillary's foreign policy advisor Jake Sullivan on February 29, 2016. The piece draws attention to Ketanji Brown Jackson, a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. 'She was confirmed by without any Republican opposition in the Senate not once, but *twice*. She was confirmed to her current position in 2013 by unanimous consent '“ that is, without any stated opposition. She was also previously confirmed unanimously to a seat on the U.S. Sentencing Commission (where she became vice chair),' reads the email. 'Her family is impressive. She is married to a surgeon and has two young daughters. Her father is a retired lawyer and her mother a retired school principal. Her brother was a police officer (in the unit that was the basis for the television show *The Wire*) and is now a law student, and she is related by marriage to Congressman (and Speaker of the House) Paul Ryan.' Earlier this month, Ryan said that he would no longer defend or campaign for Donald Trump. A poll released this week found that nearly two thirds of Republicans trust Donald Trump more than Ryan to lead the GOP. Many Trump supporters speculated that Ryan was involved in the leaking of the infamous Billy Bush tape, in which Trump made lewd comments about women, as part of a plot to sabotage the Republican nominee's campaign. Could the fact that one of his relatives is being touted as a likely Clinton Supreme Court pick be another reason as to why Ryan '“ who has been accused by many of being in bed with the Washington establishment '“ has abandoned his support for Donald Trump?

NATO and Washington's activities in Eastern Europe and the Baltics de facto amount to permanent military presence, Sergei Ermakov, a senior analyst at the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, told RT, adding that we have seen 'only the tip of the iceberg' so far. 'Endless war-games and rotational deployments essentially amount to permanent military presence. NATO is testing a drastic military buildup. We have witnessed the alliance deploy expeditionary forces and assault troops to Eastern Europe. These are offensive, not defensive forces. What we have seen is only the tip of the iceberg,' Ermakov said. 
The North Atlantic Alliance has pledged to refrain from deploying substantial forces along the NATO-Russia border on a permanent basis, but has been increasingly active in the region. The bloc approved its largest military buildup in Eastern Europe and the Baltics since the end of the Cold War at the 2016 Warsaw summit, a development viewed with deep concern in Moscow. 
As part of this initiative, Canada, Germany, the UK and the US will establish and lead four battle groups expected to be deployed in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Each will total up to 1,000 soldiers. These battalions are said to become operational in early 2017. The alliance has justified its massive buildup by blaming Russia for its ostensibly 'assertive' behavior. Moscow has consistently denied these groundless claims. 
Ermakov further explained that forces of NATO's European members are not as lethal as they might seem. 'On paper this is a force exceeding Russia's [military] potential by several times. But it lacks real combat power. This is why Americans need to be everywhere. The US was forced to boost US European Command's budget,' he said. 
Earlier this year, the Pentagon requested $3.4bn for its operations in Europe in 2017, a four-time increase compared to its $789-million budget this year. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
Russian officials and experts have repeatedly pointed out that NATO increasing assertiveness has put regional stability at risk. 
The bloc's muscle flexing and aggressive rhetoric 'greatly reduce European security and the chances for a revival of constructive dialogue between Russia and NATO, something Russia has been calling for so many years. Instead, the bloc is doing its best to provoke an arms race with unpredictable results,' Peter Korzun, an expert on wars and conflicts, wrote for the Strategic Culture Foundation. Ermakov also said that the United States wants to increase its presence in the Black Sea region to counter Russia. 'Americans can no longer count on Turkey due to the failed coup attempt. Ankara has become a complicated partner. [Washington] is instead focusing on Bulgaria and Romania,' he said. 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg mentioned Romania during a press conference held following the latest meeting of NATO's defense ministers. He said that Romanian troops will join the US-led battle group in Poland. He also said that the ministers discussed progress made in strengthening NATO's presence in the Black Sea region 'in the air, at sea and on land.' This initiative will include among other things 'a Romanian-led multinational framework brigade on land,' he observed, providing no additional information on the subject. 
Ermakov further said that Washington also wants to counter Russia in Central Asia and the Asia-Pacific region. This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 6:39 am Share this article

Zero Hedge October 27, 2016 
We have written frequently in recent weeks about a feud that erupted between Chelsea Clinton and Doug Band back in 2011 after Chelsea raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest between Band's firm, Teneo, the Clinton Foundation and the State Department(see here , here, here and here ). 
The feud ultimately resulted in Band being forced to draft a memo spelling out, in vivid detail, the many entangled relationships between himself, Teneo, the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. Fortunately, today's Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals, for the first time, the precise financial flows between the Clinton Foundation, Band's firm Teneo Consulting, and the Clinton family's private business endeavors. 
The memo starts with a brief background on Teneo, which was created in June 2011, shortly after Declan Kelly resigned from his position as 'United States Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland,' a position to which he was appointed by Secretary Clinton. 
In June 2009, DK Consulting was founded by Declan Kelley. Mr. Kelly served as COO of FTI Consulting until June 2009, when he stepped down and established DK Consulting. At that time, he also became the United States Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland . Pursuant to the terms of his exit agreement with FTI and consistent with the ethics agreement of his uncompensated special government employee appointment at the State Department, Mr. Kelly retained and continued to provide services to three paying clients (Coke, Dow, and UBS) and one pro bono client (Allstate) . In late 2009, Declan retained me as a consultant to DK Consulting to help support the needs of these clients. In May 2011, Mr. Kelly resigned his Envoy position at the State Department. In June 2011, Mr. Kelly and I founded Teneo Strategies ; simultaneously, Mr. Kelly closed DK Consulting and shifted its clients to Teneo. 
Throughout the past almost 11 years since President Clinton left office, I have sought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the Foundation . This memorandum strives to set forth how I have endeavored to support the Clinton Foundation and President Clinton personally. 
In a subsequent section of the memo entitled 'Leveraging Teneo For The Foundation,' Band spells all of the donations he solicited from Teneo 'clients' for the Clinton Foundation. In all, there are roughly $14mm of donations listed with the largest contributors being Coca-Cola, Barclays, The Rockefeller Foundation and Laureate International Universities. 
The donations from Dow Chemical are particularly notable for several reasons. First, because of other emails revealed by WikiLeaks and other FOIA requests, we now know that Dow Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris, was granted special access to then Secretary Clinton back in July 2009 at the same time he was embroiled in ongoing litigation with another Clinton Foundation donor, Kuwait, over a failed joint-venture that would have netted Dow $9BN in cash . As Band notes in his memo, 1 month after being granted special access to Secretary Clinton, Liveris invited President Clinton and Band out for a day of golf. Moreover, shortly after his meeting with Secretary Clinton and golf outing with President Clinton, Liveris decided to donate $500,000 to the Clinton Global Initiative '¦very convenient timing for all involved. 
In August of 2009, Mr. Kelly invited Mr. Liveris to play golf with President Clinton and me. Mr. Kelly subsequently asked Dow to become a CGI sponsor at the $500,000 level, which they did , as well as making a $150,000 donation to the Foundation for President Clinton to attend a Dow dinner in Davos. 
The story gets even more bizarre when Band reveals in the following footnote that Liveris provided the Dow Chemical plane to fly President Clinton and his staff from New York to California and then California to North Korea for their golf outing . We would assume this is a simple typo by Band and/or he's just geographically challenged'¦if not, this certainly raises a whole other set of questions for Bill. 
Mr. Liveris provided the Dow plane to fly President Clinton and his staff to and from California for our trip to, and from, North Korea . As a private trip, the Foundation had to pay the costs of airfare; Mr. Liveris' in kind contribution saved the Foundation in excess of $100,000 . 
According to the Dialy Caller , Dow Chemical paid Teneo $2.8 million in 2011 and $16 million in 2012 for a variety of 'consultancy services'. Of course, Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of Teneo and, as such, was set to be paid $3.5 million for that position even though he ultimately only kept $100,000 because of the scandals that erupted around the firm, including their advisory relationship with MF Global. 
Finally, Band also offers the following commentary on the '$50 million in for-profit activity' he was able to secure for Bill Clinton (as of November 2011) as well as the '$66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements.' 
Independent of our fundraising and decision-making activities on behalf of the Foundation, we have dedicated ourselves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities '“ including speeches, books, and advisory service engagements . In that context, we have in effect served as agents, lawyers, managers and implementers to secure speaking, business and advisory service deals. In support of the President's for-profit activity, we also have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, in-kind services for the President and his family '“ for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like. Neither Justin nor I are separately compensated for these activities (e.g., we do not receive a fee for, or percentage of, the more than $50 million in for-profit activity we have personally helped to secure for President Clinton to date or the $66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements). With respect to business deals for his advisory services, Justin and I found, developed and brought to President Clinton multiple arrangements for him to accept or reject. Of his current 4 arrangements, we secured all of them; and, we have helped manage and maintain all of his for-profit business relationships. Since 2001, President Clinton's business arrangements have yielded more than $30 million for him personally, with $66 million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements. 
A big part of those 'for-profit' activities was a $3.5mm annual payment from Laureate'¦ 
'¦and millions in speaking fees arranged by Band. 
Confused? Here is a simpler recap from the NYT's Nick Confessore: This Doug Band memo, in the latest Podesta dump, is the Rosetta stone of the Teneo-Clinton Foundation complex. https://t.co/a1g3nSoGPM 
'” Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 Band's argument: I am not get fully compensated for all of the stuff I do for Clintonworld, so you should let me do Teneo. Everyone wins. 
'” Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 Now, you could argue: So what? If Band gets his clients to pop over money to a charity, why is that bad? 
'” Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 But consider that Band was selling his clients on idea that giving to foundation was, in essence, a way to bolster their influence.

'” Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 '¦Teneo extracted earnings for Band and, depending on what you see in these e-mails, Clinton himself. Teneo paid Clinton until late '11. 
'” Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 I guess you can wave it all off as a nothingburger. But Chelsea Clinton and some of Clinton's other aides were clearly freaking out. 
'” Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016 Generally, the emails show Clinton's *own closest aides* troubled or horrified by things that her surrogates have spent years waving off. 
'” Nick Halloween (@nickconfessore) October 26, 2016

End Of The American Dream October 27, 2016 
If you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as 'dangerous' and 'temperamental', because it is Clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. 
She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades . Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election I am fully convinced that World War 3 will begin before her time in the White House is over. 
Someone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters , Trump recently stated that we are 'going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton''¦ 
On Syria's civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict. 
Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and 'safe zones' on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets. 
'What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,' said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. 'You're going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.' 
In order to have a no-fly zone in Syria, you would have to enforce it. 
And in order to enforce it, you would have to be willing to shoot at the Russians. 
According to National Intelligence Director James Clapper , that could have dire consequences'¦ 
Russia could shoot down a U.S. aircraft if a no-fly zone were imposed over Syria, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Tuesday. 
'I wouldn't put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,' Clapper said, speaking with CBS' Charlie Rose at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York about several national security issues. 
Of course Clapper is not alone in that assessment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Francis Dunford, says that imposing a no-fly zone over all of Syria 'would require us to go to war' '¦ 
'Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,'¦ That's a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I'm not going to make.' ( Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added) 
But Hillary Clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants. 
You see, the truth is that Hillary Clinton wants to win the war that she started in Syria. Back in 2011, she spearheaded an effort along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey to try to use the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East as an opportunity to try to overthrow President Assad in Syria. If it wasn't for her meddling, millions of refugees would not be pouring into Europe and elsewhere, and there would be no 'humanitarian crisis' in Syria at all. 
Thanks to Russian intervention, the war in Syria is not too far from being over, but the Obama administration is desperate to keep it going. They understand that if Assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted, and that is why they are so determined to keep Aleppo from falling. Without Aleppo, many of the jihadist rebels that the Obama administration has been supporting won't have anywhere to hide. 
So the Obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the Syrian military, and the Russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen . If Obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against Syrian forces and the Russians start shooting back, that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control. 
One recent survey found that current American leadership has a 1 percent approval rating in Russia right now, and the Russians dislike Hillary Clinton even more than they dislike Barack Obama. The Russians know that if Hillary Clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us, and that is why they desperately want Donald Trump to win in November. You can see this outlook reflected in comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin recently made about the two candidates '¦ 
'Mrs. Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russia. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, calls for cooperation '“ at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism,' Putin said. 
'Naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us. And we consider it wrong, that we always have to be in conflict with one another, creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world,' Putin noted. 
Anyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that Hillary Clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for Russia. The thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate, but it may soon become a reality. 
And even now, the Obama administration and our NATO allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with Moscow. This week it is being reported that NATO troops will soon be sent to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania '¦ Nine hundred US troops are to be sent to eastern Europe next year as America's troubled relationship with Russia enters new, uncertain territory. A US-led battle group of NATO allied soldiers will be sent to Poland as part of the multi-nation operation. British forces will lead one of the four battle groups in Estonia, Canada will spearhead the presence in Latvia and Germany will be present in Lithuania. 
In addition, Infowars is reporting that U.S. Marines will soon be stationed in Norway near the border with Russia'¦ 
After accepting a Pentagon proposal, Norway will host US Marines at a base near the Russian border as Russia deploys nuclear-capable ships to Kaliningrad. 
A rotating force of approximately 330 Marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of Vaernes, just outside Trondheim, beginning in January. Norway and Russia share an 122-mile border in the Arctic. 
'The US initiative to augment their training and exercises in Norway by locating a Marine Corps Rotational Force in Norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship,' said Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen SÃ¸reide. 
Most Americans aren't aware of any of this, nor do they really care about our relationship with Russia. 
But in Russia things are completely different. The possibility of war with the United States is the biggest news story over there these days , and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation '¦ 
Russian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. 
At the Kremlin's Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. 
The country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. 
I know that I have been writing about this over and over , but the truth is that we are on a path to war with Russia, and the election of Hillary Clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war. 
In my controversial new book , I expressed my belief that war with Russia is coming, but at the time that I wrote it I didn't know how the election would turn out. 
At this point it looks like Clinton is very likely to win on November 8th, and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with Russia. 
If you are reading this and you are considering voting for Hillary Clinton, please don't do it . We simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the White House at this critical time. 
If the American people do choose Hillary Clinton this November, I believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly, bitterly regret in future years. This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 6:01 am Share this article

London Telegraph October 27, 2016 
B ritain's economy expanded by 0.5pc in the three months following the EU referendum, slowing down a touch from the 0.7pc growth recorded in the previous quarter but defying the most pessimistic predictions made by the Remain campaign. 
The country's economic performance was stronger than the 0.3pc predicted by economists, and in line with the official forecasts made before the referendum took place '“ in March the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted third quarter growth of 0.5pc. It also disproves the Treasury's referendum campaign claim that a vote to leave the EU would r esult in 0.1pc fall in GDP in the third quarter that would herald the start of a recession. The Treasury's worst-case 'severe shock' scenario was even more pessimistic, predicting a 1pc fall in the three-month period. 
S terling rallied on the initial estimates from the Office for National Statistics, and economists said the unexpectedly strong numbers made it less likely that the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) would cut interest rates at next month's monetary policy committee meeting.

Louder With Crowder October 27, 2016 
Sometimes a thin layer of crust accumulates on the surface of the ocean, mostly made up of fecal matter and trash. It's where environmentalists come from. 
They are, effectively, the pits. Also, environmentalists hate people (see Top 5 Environmentalists Who Openly Support Killing Off Humans ). A side effect of being sad, soggy little bottom dwellers. So it's no surprise they want to kill off coal mines in Montana , despite the fact that said coal mines are pillars which help support the economy and the town's well being. Also electric cars , but whatever: 
The 2,300 residents in Southeast Montana face an uphill battle to keep the city alive against an onslaught of legal battles and a major anti-coal crusade launched by outsiders. 
An out of court agreement was reached to close two of the four units of Colstrip's coal-fired power plant by 2022. The Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center, which sued the plant, see the closure as a victory. 
Plant operators came to an agreement with activists [because] Oregon Democratic Gov. signed legislation mandating the state be coal-free by 2030'¦ 
Consequences. 
It's a win for everybody. Except the people employed by the coal plant'¦ Also, Colstrip's entire economy. Coal plant workers make money, then spend that money at other businesses. Except now all those lads will be jobless, which means they won't be spending money or helping to boost the economy as much anymore, which means other businesses will suffer. Thanks environmentalists. 
By the way, 'Green Earth' SJWs tend to also be fans of the Indians . The people, not the baseball team. Racist. That wee tidbit is worth noting, considering how their eco-friendly plan isn't very native-friendly'¦ 
'You lose two of those units, and you are shutting down half the town,' Small said. 'This closure will have an economic impact on the reservations, throughout the County and across the State'¦' Small is of North Cheyenne descent. He's made an extra effort to recruit American Indian students'¦ Nearly three dozen Northern Cheyenne work at the Colstrip plant, and three times that figure work in the coal fields. 
A double header. Bad for the economy, bad for the indigenous people. 
As mentioned above, the coal plant never stood a chance. Thanks to impending regulations, the plant has long seen the end drawing near. Possibly because they would rather close indefinitely in order to be spared from ever having to hear another squawking lobbyist attempt to 'talk' them into seeing things their way. Whatever the reason, environmentalists and the state teamed up to bully the coal plant into shutting down. Now the future of an entire town lies in jeopardy. 
Environmentalists happily stomped their cloven hooves all over people's livelihoods. But hey, less smog. #Caring 
Also, man'“made climate change of the hot hots is a myth. Stop it. This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 5:55 am Share this article

College Reform October 27, 2016 
Grinnell College is promoting a guide to help students avoid 'cultural appropriation' this Halloween, warning that some costumes could be considered 'deplorable and problematic.' 
The guide provides several examples of costumes that might fit the definition of 'cultural appropriation,' defining the term as 'the act of displaying people's cultures in a disrespectful or condescending manner.' 
The guide, called 'My Identity, Not Your Costume,' goes on to list several examples of 'offensive' Halloween costumes, featuring pictures of Grinnell students holding photos of costumes that would be considered disrespectful towards their culture. 
In one instance, the guide shows a picture of a burly white man dressed in lingerie with a sash proclaiming 'Call me Caitlyn,' referring to Caitlyn Jenner. The photo is held by a Grinnell student wearing a 'National Coming Out Day' pin, and includes a caption stating, 'the misrepresentation of my identity bothers me because people categorize me by my looks and may not understand my culture.' 
Another example of culturally appropriated Halloween costumes, according to the guide, is 'using other cultures as accessories to appear more hip/interesting without adequate understanding or permission,' one example of which is a picture of someone dressed as a Hindu deity being held by an Indian student and the message that such costumes are 'deplorable and problematic.' 
It then warns students that if their costumes take 'defining characteristics of another culture' without 'permission, or understanding of the historical background behind the said culture,' then these costumes might be too offensive to wear. 
The guide then concludes with two questions the school thinks students should consider before selecting a Halloween costume, asking, 'Does your costume perpetuate stereotypes or inaccurately portray my culture as a joke?' as well as 'Why would I find your 'Halloween costume' to be offensive?' 
Campus Reform reached out to Grinnell for a comment on the matter but did not receive a response in time for publication. This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 5:53 am Share this article

Liberty Blitzkrieg October 27, 2016 
The name Peter Kadzik probably doesn't ring a bell for many of you, although it probably should. This guy is a real piece of work, as an excellent article published earlier today at the Daily Caller demonstrates. 
Here's some of what we learned: 
The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, the Democrat's campaign chairman, met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. 
The dinner arrangement, revealed in hacked Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks, is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state's email practices. 
Podesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta's birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik's son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
'The political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I don't think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server,' says Matthew Whitaker, the executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a government watchdog group. 
Kadzik, who started at the DOJ in 2013, helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. 
Kadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. 
In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. 
Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a 'fantastic lawyer' who 'kept me out of jail.' 
Podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for the investigation. But he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from Clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. 
'He did lie to me,' Podesta said about Clinton in a National Public Radio interview in 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in Feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Lewinsky probe. 
Kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky, represented Podesta through the fiasco. 
Podesta had been promoted to Clinton's chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. 
Kadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. 
To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. 
A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that 'Kadzik was recruited into Marc Rich's lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.' 
The report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Rich's pardon. 
On top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Rich's ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library. 
The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the WikiLeaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant. 
The dinner was set for 7:30 that evening, just a day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee. 
Podesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podesta's home, another email shows . And in an email sent on May 5, 2015, Kadzik's son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
I'll have the lobster risotto with a side of cronyism and middle class destruction. 
As head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Kadzik handles inquiries from Congress on a variety of issues. In that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the Clinton investigation. 
The Justice Department and FBI have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in July with no charges filed against Clinton. 
But Kadzik worked on other Clinton email issues in his dealings with Congress. 
Last November, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation. 
Seems like a pretty important decision for a Clinton crony to make. 
The Justice Department declined to comment on the record for this article. 
Could the Department of Injustice have any less credibility?

  Bill Clinton is a sex-addicted 'monster' who mocked Hillary Clinton by calling her 'The Warden' in front of friends and privately boasted about his high notch count, according to his long-time mistress and childhood friend Dolly Kyle. Kyle, now 68, says she had a decades-long affair with   before and during his marriage and had a front-row seat to Bill's salacious double-life in the 1970s and '80s. Their on-again, off-again relationship ended abruptly in the 1990s, after Bill Clinton allegedly threatened to 'destroy' Kyle if she spoke to the media about their relationship. Kyle's decades of observations, shared in an interview with the DailyMail.com as well as in her 2016 book The Other Woman, provide a unique perspective on the Clintons' marriage and the couple's treatment of the women who have accused   of infidelity or sexual assault over the years. Kyle, an Arkansas native who has since befriended several of Bill Clinton's sexual assault accusers, said she was determined to come forward with her story after hearing Hillary Clinton say on the campaign trail that women who have been sexually assaulted have the 'right to be believed'.  35

  The latest hacked email released by WikiLeaks details how one of Bill Clinton's closest aides helped rake in tens of millions for   while his wife was serving as Secretary of State. The 12-page memo was sent by Clinton's former aide Doug Band in 2011 to him, his daughter Chelsea, several board members of the Clinton Foundation and its lawyers as well as its then special advisor John Podesta. Published on Wednesday by Wikileaks, after a hack of thousands of emails from Podesta's account, it details how Band helped run what he called 'Bill Clinton Inc.' Band and another aide helped secure $66million from ventures, including speaking fees, according to the memo. 
He wrote that, using his role as the president of his own consulting firm Teneo, Band worked to raise funds for the Foundation and Clinton personally.  29

Meanwhile Hillary Clinton is at home sleeping 
Steve Watson Prison Planet.com October 27, 2016 
GOP nominee Donald Trump took time out of a relentless campaign schedule Wednesday to spend around an hour opening a new hotel, prompting one CNN reporter to accuse Trump of 'taking time out of swing states.' Meanwhile Hillary Clinton is again nowhere to be seen. 
CNN's Dana Bash suggested that Trump should be more concerned with campaigning in swing states, yet Trump had three campaign stops scheduled for the same day. Dana Bash: Is your DC hotel opening free advertising?Donald Trump: 'No, not at all' https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/9HHqooom8r 
'” CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 26, 2016 
'So to people who say you're taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?' Bash asked. 
'I say the following: You have been covering me for the last '” long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I've been doing this for weeks straight,' Trump responded. 
'For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you'll ask me that question. I think that's a very rude question, to be honest with you.' Trump exclaimed. 
Trump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule, suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit. 
While CNN has continuously run defense for Hillary Clinton amid a myriad of scandals, and even rigged its own polls to suggest she won the debates, the network has been forced to admit that Hillary is running an extremely light campaign schedule. 
Last month, for example, Hillary went six days without an event except for a short speech she gave in Orlando, Florida. 
And in August, Hillary took seven of the first 14 days of the month off and even went four days without a single campaign appearance. 
'Her speeches are so short '“ they don't last long, they're like 10 minutes and 'let's get out of here,'' Donald Trump said about her schedule. 'Go back home and go to sleep.' This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 8:12 am Share this article

People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?' 
Steve Watson Prison Planet.com October 27, 2016 
GOP Nominee Donald Trump, who has for weeks warned that the election could be rigged against him, shot out a tweet Thursday indicating that he is aware of reports of machines 'flipping' to register votes for Hillary Clinton, when voters choose Trump. 
'A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas,' Trump tweeted. 
'People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?' A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on? 
'” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2016 
As Infowars has highlighted , there have already been numerous reports of early voters in Texas seeing their ballots flipped from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
While election officials have dismissed the reports, suggesting 'user error' is to blame, tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time. 
Larry Norden, a voting technology expert, told NPR that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed. 
'Over time, as people vote, that calibration becomes less and less accurate,' Norden noted. 
During elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines 'flipping'. Indeed, the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as The Simpsons drew attention to it: 
Meanwhile, The Washington Post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression, bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering Trump's 'rigged' election claims. 
Callum Borchers, author at the Washington Post blog The Fix writes: Since the final presidential debate last week, many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to Donald Trump supporters: Your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election Nov. 8. A day later, the Times's Upshot blog increased Clinton's chances of winning to 93 percent , an all-time high. On Monday, Politico's Ben Schreckinger wrote that ' Donald Trump's path to an election night win is almost entirely closed .' Here at The Fix, Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake wrote that ' Donald Trump's chances of winning are approaching zero .' These are accurate, statistically sound statements. But they are something else, too. Declarations that Trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the Republican nominee's warning that the 'rigged' election could be ' stolen from us .' 
The latest polls, which Trump insists are rigged due to oversampling, show Clinton with a double digit lead. 
However, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook has warned that Trump's suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are 'absolutely right.' 
'We've seen polls tighten since the third debate and we expect things to get even closer before Election Day.' Mook said, urging Clinton supporters to vote. 
'Make no mistake. With only 10 percent of votes cast, Donald Trump could win this election,' Mook said.   9:15

Daily Mail October 27, 2016 Republicans say they'll keep the heat on Hillary Clinton if she wins the Oval Office with new investigations into her family charity and quid pro quo allegations. Judicial Watch, a conservative group that's been at the forefront of Clinton's email scandal, is already talking impeachment for the not-yet president. 'I know this generation of Republican leaders is loath to exercise these tools, but impeachment is something that's relevant,' the organization's president, Tom Fitton, told NBC News. Fitton noted, however, that congressional Republicans were unlikely to follow his advice. 'They see [the oversight process] as an opportunity in some measure to keep their opponents off-kilter, but they don't want to do the substantive and principled work to truly hold corrupt politicians, or the administration, or anyone accountable,' he charged. Republicans on Capitol Hill are gearing up for a bevy of new investigations involving Clinton in the next Congress.   8:32

On Wednesday's Morning Joe , co-host Joe Scarborough once again was forced to actually tell the truth about the liberal bias in media coverage throughout this entire election. 
Scarborough, a former Florida Republican congressman, began the discussion stating that: 
'[A]s a Republican there's a natural reaction to press bias and it has been so overwhelming even if it is has been earned. The media has taken sides. They've aggressively taken sides and they've admitted that we're aggressively taking sides and I think you get some Republicans that see that every four years. It's so funny. They do that every four years. Every four years it's like the end of the world if a Republican gets elected president because they're all racist. It's the boy that cried wolf.' 
In a sense, what was articulated is that the mass media's historic liberal bias against conservatives is reflected in every election so much so that in this one, their usual partisan attacks against Trump's controversial personality are not as effective. Also, Scarborough stated the fact shared by many conservatives that there is an overwhelming and aggressive agenda by the press to defend liberals. 
Furthermore, in conversation with frequent panelist Mike Barnicle, Scarborough added: 'Also, it's such a confounding election where we go back and forth on what it's about, Mike Barnicle said all along that it's about Hillary Clinton. People say 'I'm going to vote for Hillary Clinton as a protest against'¦' and then after sitting on that for a couple of weeks that thought for a couple weeks they go 'eh'¦maybe not.'' 
In a way, they were all trying to explain how Trump is still almost tied to Clinton in a number of battleground state polls, despite the disproportionate amount of negative coverage. Later on in response to co-host Willie Geist's remarks about the race being almost over, Scarborough proved his earlier point about the media's disconnect: 
'I got to say, Willie. Everybody that is saying it's over and you're a fool if you're suggesting that the American people may have the final say at the voting booth are the same people that were saying in August, September, October, November, December, January, February that there was no way in a million years that Donald Trump would ever win the Republican nomination. Stating it just as emphatically as they're stating now that we need to avert our eyes, this race is over. '

Washington Free Beacon October 27, 2016 
CNN commentator Angela Rye on Wednesday blamed the failure of Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare for the newly announced double-digit premium increases in the president's signature health care law. 
'It's not just Hillary Clinton that needs to tackle this but also Congress,' Rye said on CNN's New Day. 'The reason we are in the position that we are in right now frankly, Alisyn, is because Republicans fell short of their promise to repeal, which is what they said they wanted to do, and replace.' 
Host Alisyn Camerota stopped Rye before she got any further and reminded her that President Obama had promised premiums would go down. 
Most states will see health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act increase by an average of 25 percent, according to data released this week by the Obama administration. Indiana will see its rates slightly go down, but other states like Arizona will see costs skyrocket by 116 percent. Members of the administration have been quick to soften the blow of the increase by reminding people that a majority of those on the Obamacare exchanges would be receiving tax credits to help pay for the now more expensive health insurance plans.   8:17

Local authorities in Calais claim that the 'Jungle' refugee camp has been successfully evacuated, but according to an RT crew at the site, a number of refugees and migrants apparently remain at the half-demolished camp. 
Unlike the previous days and nights, the demolition of the site on Wednesday for the most part passed off peacefully. 
'This is the end of the 'Jungle,'' Calais regional prefect Fabienne Buccio reported. 'Mission accomplished.' 
The statement may be as premature as the one made in the same words by then US President George W Bush after the Iraq invasion in 2003. RT's crew on the ground reports that dozens of people remain at the camp. 
'Soon after that statement was made we went inside and saw that there was either a massive blunder in terms of their public relations line or a lie. The camp was far from being evacuated and closed,' RT's Harry Fear reported from the scene. 
On Thursday, Buccio warned that refugees arriving at the 'Jungle' camp in the future would not be offered resettlement, unlike those evacuated in recent days. 
'It is not Calais' role to receive all the migrants of Europe. We do not want to create a vacuum. We have asked [those newly arrived] migrants to disperse,' she said. 
Earlier in the day, about 100 migrants were seen filing past police officers overseeing the camp demolition, Reuters reports.   6:43

The number of wild animals on Earth could fall by more than two-thirds in the 50 years to 2020, according to a new report which places the blame on the destruction of habitats, hunting and pollution. The forecast could lead to major consequences for humans. 
The Living Planet Report 2016 says that animal losses are on track to reach 67 percent in the 50 years to 2020. The report's authors also took into consideration a recent trend in animal population decline, citing a 58 percent plummet between 1970 and 2012. 
The researchers analyzed the changing presence of 14,152 monitored populations of the 3,706 vertebrate species '“ mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles among them. 
According to the paper, the biggest cause of the plummeting animal populations is the destruction of wilderness areas by farming and logging. Pollution was also mentioned as a significant problem.

'Humanity's misuse of natural resources is threatening habitats, pushing irreplaceable species to the brink, and threatening the stability of our climate,' said WWF's director of science, Mike Barrett. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
Animals across the planet are expected to be affected. However, rivers and lakes are the hardest-hit areas. Barrett noted that global warming is exacerbating the pressures. 
'We are no longer a small world on a big planet. We are now a big world on a small planet, where we have reached a saturation point,' the Stockholm Resilience Center's Professor Johan RockstrÃ¶m said in a foreword for the report. 
The decline in wildlife, along with climate change, is part of the proposed notion of Anthropocene, a term which suggests a new era in which humans have managed to have a significant global impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems. 
The notion '“ which has yet to be officially approved as a term used to explain geological time '“ can lead to major consequences. 
'The richness and diversity of life on Earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it. Life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation. Lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems, as we know them today, will collapse,' WWF Director-General Marco Lambertini said, as quoted by the Guardian. 
In fact, the report states that humans could be anything but happy if the forecast comes to fruition, noting that the predicted situation could provoke serious competition. 
'Increased human pressure threatens the natural resources that humanity depends upon, increasing the risk of water and food insecurity and competition over natural resources,' the report states. 
There does, however, appear to be some hope. Some species are beginning to recover, suggesting that conservation efforts could help tackle the crisis. 
However, Barrett noted that in order for such efforts to take place, society must largely change how it consumes resources. 
'You'd like to think that was a no-brainer in that if a business is consuming the raw materials for its products in a way that is not sustainable, then inevitably it will eventually put itself out of business,' Barrett said. 
'The report is certainly a pretty shocking snapshot of where we are,' he added. 'My hope though is that we don't throw our hands up in despair '“ there is no time for despair, we have to crack on and act. I do remain convinced we can find our sustainable course through the Anthropocene, but the will has to be there to do it.' 
The new report comes less than two months after a similar analysis found that Earth has lost one-tenth of its wilderness sites since the early 1990s.   6:41

Record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban 
Steve   
A new poll released by Gallup has found that a record amount of Americans are opposed to gun control measures . 
The survey found that 76 percent of respondents, over three quarters, believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law. 
The findings represent a four-point increase on the same survey from last year, in addition to an all-time high for the past three decades. 
The poll also found that almost two thirds, 61 percent, are 'against' a ban on semi-automatic rifles, or 'assault weapons'as the corporate media refers to them. 
That figure represents a full ten-point increase on previous findings, and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue 20 years ago. 
Just 27 percent, less than a third, say they support a ban on handgun ownership, while only 36 percent, support a semi-automatic ban. an eight-point decline on previous findings. 
In addition, gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end. 
In a summary of the new poll, Gallup seemed surprised, by the findings, describing waning support for a gun ban as a 'paradox': 
Perhaps paradoxically, opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles. These guns were used in high-profile incidents, including the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, and the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut. 
The findings reveal just how out of step Hillary Clinton's position on gun control is with the majority of Americans. 
Hillary is a staunch gun control proponent. Wikileaks releases have revealed that Hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order. 
Clinton purportedly plans to open gun manufacturers to lawsuits by crime victims, a move that critics say would do nothing to reduce crime, but would bankrupt'“and eventually end'“gun manufacturing in the United States.

David Brock accused of 'elitist racism' 
Paul Joseph   A new email released as part of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accusing Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being 'stupid'. The email , sent to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and another Clinton ally CEO Roy Spence, centers around a discussion of a Bernie Sanders campaign ad which featured 'many black faces'. Back in January, Clinton operative David Brock caused consternation within the campaign when he publicly claimed that Bernie Sanders didn't care about black people. Budowsky is not impressed with Brock's outburst, writing in the email, 'Brock makes the cardinal mistake of those who bring politics into disrepute with voters. He tells a lie that people will know is a lie, and insults the intelligence of black voters with a kind of elitist racism that Bill and Hillary Clinton should not be seen with.' 'I guess Brock's plan is that black voters are stupid and will not watch the ad and believe his lie,' writes Budowsky. 'I cannot think of anything more desperate, more stupid and more self-destructive than David Brock lying about the Bernie ad and playing a seamy brand of the politics of race using the tactic of deceit on her behalf,' adds the The Hill and Huffington Post columnist, before offering to write a campaign ad for HIllary to counter the Bernie Sanders ad. The email once again underscores the Clinton camp's paranoia about not being able to authentically connect with African-American voters in a way that Bernie Sanders could. Some black voters have been reluctant to support Clinton as a result of her support for a 1994 crime bill that resulted in the mass incarceration of young black Americans, whom Hilary referred to at the time as 'super predators'.

Britain is deploying troops, aircraft and armor in the biggest military buildup in Eastern Europe since the Cold War. 
The deployment, which was first floated in the press by UK defense chiefs on Wednesday, appears to have been prepared well in advance. 
It will see up to 800 armored infantry troops deployed to Estonia and Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter jets deployed to Romania in what appears to be a reiteration of the strategy of containment employed against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. 
France and Denmark will also commit more troops. 
On Wednesday, UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon struck a belligerent tone in the Wall Street Journal when he warned that Europe ' is our continent ' and, as such, would be defended. 
While he claimed the force would be ' defensive in nature ' he pledged it would be ' fully combat-capable. ' A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
He denied the placement of small formations around the Baltic area are merely a ' trip-wire ' in case of the much-heralded, but hypothetical, clash with Russia. 
' This is a serious military presence, ' he said. 
Tensions have only just begun to subside after a fleet of Russian naval vessels bound for the Mediterranean Sea passed through the North Sea and English Channel. 
The passage caused a press frenzy in the UK, framed as though Russia was launching an invasion of the British Isles. The Royal Navy deployed destroyers to, in Fallon's words, ' man-mark ' the vessels while the RAF overflew the ships with fighter jets. 
According to the Russian military, the naval group's task was to ' ensure a naval presence in operationally significant areas of the world's oceans, ' as well as ' the safety of maritime navigation and other maritime economic activities ' of Russia. 
Britain's deployment of troops, drones and aircraft is expected to begin in May 2018. This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 6:45 am Share this article

American Mirror October 27, 2016 
For at least the second time in the last several days, cameras captured Hillary Clinton's eyes acting strangely. 
The behavior, which doctors have told The American Mirror appears to be 'disconjugate gaze' '” a common symptom of increased intracranial pressure, or swelling of the brain '” was evident again during a rally on Wednesday in Lake Worth, Florida. 
Here are several more of the instances from today: 
Despite getting major coverage on The Drudge Report, no mainstream news outlet has covered the apparent issue with Clinton's eyes. 
But the several instances over the last few weeks, and as recently as last Friday , have been enough for doctors to publicly call on Clinton to undergo a full medical example and release the results. 
'My rational self would say that they could have defused all this a long time ago by releasing her medical records and having her undergo the same type of neurologic exam that every high school football player in America who 'gets his bell rung' on Friday night must undergo before he can suit up for the game next Friday,' Dr. John R. Coppedge, a surgical specialist from Texas, told The American Mirror . A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
'She needs a full neurology evaluation, neuro-opthalmology evaluation, MRI, cerebral venography and a lumbar puncture,' Dr. Gerald Gianoli, an expert in intracranial pressure, said to this news site. 
'It is possible that her status could be significantly improved. But at the same time, she risks demonstrating to the public that her medical problems are more serious than she has let on in the past.' 
Gianoli, who believes the condition could be the result of elevated pressure, which can cause other problems. 
'It can lead to blindness, deafness, progressive vertigo/balance problems, seizures/stroke and continued problems with concentration, memory and ability to mentally focus,' he said. 
'It could also lead to death if the lateral sinus thrombosis were to progress to include the opposite side.' This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 5:57 am Share this article

Why So Few Whistleblowers? A Former CIA Agent's Story Â« on: Today at 11:42:10 AM Â» Kevin Shipp is a major whistleblower coming from a solid background as a courageous, decorated CIA officer and anti terrorism expert. He held several high level positions in the CIA. A 2011 New York Times article describes the shocking details of Shipp's harrowing personal story of seeking justice and eventually turning whistleblower after his health and the health of his family were severely compromised.Running into the juggernaut faced by so many whistleblowers, Shipp ended up with both his marriage and his career destroyed. Yet in the end Shipp prevailed and managed to stay out of jail. He now speaks openly about both his own personal experiences and how the system works to silence and punish whistleblowers, and in so doing keep corruption and illegal activities at all levels covered up.Shipp's excellent essay below explains in detail why so few whistleblowers have come out on highly illegal activities related to Pentagon corruption, CIA manipulation and overthrow of governments, 9/11 shenanigans, secret mind control programs, and much more. His words show just how much courage it takes for people like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange to expose major government corruption. By spreading the word and calling for clear strong laws to protect whistleblowers, we can make a difference.With best wishes for a transformed world,Fred Burks for PEERS and WantToKnow.infoFormer White House interpreter and whistleblowerSilencing WhistleblowersBy Kevin ShippWhy donÂ’t more Â“whistleblowersÂ” come out to expose illegal or unconstitutional secret government operations? If these activities are so illegal, why are people not coming forward to report them?Over the last fifty years US government intelligence agencies have perfected a complex, sequential system to systematically silence or destroy any employee, including his or her family, who attempts to reveal illegal or unconstitutional activities conducted as part of secret government operations.As a condition of employment, military and intelligence employees recruited for secret operations are required to sign a Â“secrecy agreement,Â” or Â“nondisclosure agreement,Â” before being given access to the position, which offers high pay and status in the organization. This agreement threatens civil and criminal penalties if the employee reveals ANY information regarding the program. Thinking the agreement will only be used for legal purposes and will get them the coveted job, all employees eagerly sign it.This secrecy agreement was originally designed to protect legitimate classified information, to protect military personnel during wartime and protect legitimate national defense information and technology.However, because of the binding power of the agreement, government agencies began using it as a powerful tool to silence federal employees who question the legality of certain government operations. It was the perfect tool to threaten, silence or jail any whistle blower who dared to challenge the secret operations of government.Today, the secrecy agreement is routinely used as an efficient weapon to intimidate or silence employees. Annual refresher briefings are given to remind employees of the penalties for violating the agreement. These penalties include huge fines, termination, financial ruin and even prison Â– all of which mean the destruction of their lives and their families. Most will not reveal any wrongdoing, no matter how egregious, for fear of calculated, severe retribution.When employees sign the secrecy agreement and are cleared for classified programs, they are not told they are giving up their right to a jury trial, or to sue the agency that hired them. If they try to do so as a whistle blower, they find they have no right to be heard in federal court. Many have found this out when their case was denied; then it was too late. That is part of the system.If the employee attempts to contact their Congressman or Senator, their representative is blocked from receiving any information about their case, because they do not have the necessary Â“clearance.Â”When the employee attempts to blow the whistle to the Congressional intelligence committees, their response is ignored. It is made clear to committee members that they are not to touch such cases, so they refer them back to their Senator or Congressman, who cannot access information involved in their case.If a courageous employee continues to proceed and blow the whistle, a system of personal and career destruction follows. This begins with promotions being denied, being turned down for sensitive or career enhancing assignments, and their files being flagged, ruining their reputation inside their agency. At this point their career is over. If they go quietly, the retribution stops.When the employee still continues their effort to report the information, their travel records, personnel records, medical records and security records are searched for mistakes or damaging information that can be used to threaten them with termination. Their telephones and computers are monitored searching for incriminating information. If no substantive information can be found, it is fabricated and placed in their file.Employees who refuse to back down are then subjected to internal Â“security investigations,Â” multiple, hostile Â“interviews,Â” attempting to get them to recant their information, and multiple polygraph interrogations.In many cases, the employee is commanded to report to the internal medical office for psychological evaluation. If they comply, the evaluation labels them as paranoid, unstable, or disgruntled. This information is placed in their file and is used later to justify the agencyÂ’s action in the event of outside scrutiny.If the employee contacts a member of the news media, they are immediately cited with violating their secrecy agreement and criminal penalties are filed against them. Several news media outlets are connected to the CIA and NSA and notify them of the employeeÂ’s contact.Finally, the employee is forced to resign after being threatened with termination in kangaroo court meetings where the information fabricated in their files is used against them.After termination or forced resignation, interest rates on their internal credit union loans are raised to make the payments unaffordable. The release of the employeeÂ’s retirement funds needed provide for their family are blocked (a felony). The agency black lists them from gaining employment with other government agencies or contractors, further ruining them financially.Dehumanized, financially ruined and under severe emotional and mental pressure, the employeeÂ’s family begins to break apart. If the familyÂ’s foundation is not strong, this results in alcoholism, depression and divorce. In some cases, it has resulted in the employee committing suicide, the ultimate goal of the program of destruction. This silences the employee permanently, obscuring the agencyÂ’s role in their destruction. It is the perfect crime.Should the employee still have the resolve to endure this program of career and personal destruction and continues to press for release of the information, or if his family members attempt to sue the agency for the illegal activity, classified agencies will invoke the secretive State Secrets Privilege, which orders the employee and his family not to reveal the information or face prison. If the familyÂ’s case reaches federal court, the State Secrets Privilege is invoked and the case is shut down Â– and sealed. Federal judges rubber stamp the censoring of the case without reviewing the case facts.Now that the employeeÂ’s case, and in some cases their familyÂ’s case, is shut down and under seal, citing Â“national security,Â” the process of silencing the employee is complete. Many are never heard from again, fearing prison if they talk to anyone, including an attorney.Using attractive awards of multi-million dollar contracts, the US government military industrial complex convinces private corporations that their employees must be cleared and sign secrecy agreements. This includes employees at all levels, from secretaries to CEOs. Once they have signed the secrecy agreement, they are bound to keep all information, including potentially illegal information, quiet, being threatened with the same penalties.To date, over five million Americans have been required to sign this secrecy agreement and now fall under the shadow of the State Secrets Privilege.Only a few federal employees have made it through this systematic process of destruction to reveal what they know about the illegal operation they observed. Sadly, some whistle blowers have died Â“mysteriousÂ” deaths or committed Â“suicide.Â”Employees in intelligence agencies are aware of penalties contained in the secrecy agreement and the huge risk in violating it, even to expose corruption. Most look the other way to protect their careers, retirements and families. Many have observed the outward signs of the system of personal and career destruction used on others and a culture of fear exists. But, they are not fully aware of all that is being done. The full scope of the system is only known at the higher levels of the organization and is hidden from employees, until its use is necessary.This is why we do not see whistle blowers coming out and reporting what they have seen. This system has been used and perfected for over fifty years. It is being used because it works.It works, unless the system is exposed, the whistle blower knows what is coming and prepares for it, and they are supported by private organizations and individuals dedicated to truth in government.This support is essential, not only to protect the whistle blower and their family, but also to defend our Constitutional form of government from tyranny.Kevin M.
