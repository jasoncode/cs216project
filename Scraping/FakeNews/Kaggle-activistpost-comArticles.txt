In the midst of deepening tension between US allies NATO and Russia, NATO is planning the largest military buildup along the Russian border since the cold war. 
NATO called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort. According to Reuters , thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks. 
It was reported that Italy, France, Denmark and other European states are expected to join the NATO military divisions that will be led by the United States along Russia's border. 
On Wednesday, Britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russia's borders as part of a huge military deployment. 
A total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military build-up of NATO troops on Russia's borders since the Cold War. 
In addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation, NATO has an army of over 40,000 ready to be called up to fight at any time. 
The US military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a 'deterrent' to the Russian military, but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war. 
'This is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict,' NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday '” ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation. 
Just imagine what would happen if Russian troops amassed along the Mexican border and told the US that this move was to 'prevent conflict.' 
The so-called Iskander-M cruise missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. 
The United States' envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute, told reporters that NATO and the US military may consider Russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of NATO's deployment. This statement is insane considering the fact that the US military is the one that is many miles from home on the border of someone else's lands. 
'This deployment, if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in (Russia's) security posture,' Lute said. 
If anyone is a threat, it is NATO and the US government. 
These military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in Syria, in which Western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups. Meanwhile, Russia has interests in keeping their allies in the Syrian government in control, putting the two superpowers at odds. 
Until now, Russia and the US have been fighting through third parties, just as they had during the previous Cold War, and the same type of situation is developing today.

In the video below the 'folk hero' of the Iraqi Counter-Terror Services and regular Iraqi army takes a direct hit in the battle for Mosul. 
The destruction of an Abrams tank by a Russian ATGM Kornet missile is good news if you're a stockholder in General Dynamics Land Systems, formerly Chrysler Defense. 
General Dynamics makes the Abrams battle tank. 
Each one costs $9 million. 
The US will simply ship another tank to replace the one destroyed along with its presumed Iraqi crew. Iraqi lives are a cheap commodity, so it will not be a problem to find another expendable tank crew. 
Back in 2012 former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond Odierno testified to Congress that the Army has more than enough tanks. He suggested the line at General Dynamics be shut down temporarily. 'Our tank fleet is two and a half years old on average now. We're in good shape and these are additional tanks that we don't need,' he said. 
Congress budgeted more money for new tanks anyway. Rep. Mac Thornberry, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said more tanks were needed in Europe to confront Vladimir Putin. 
Military readiness is a 'consumable,' said Maj. Gen. Thomas A. Horlander, the Army's budget director. Military hardware is 'cumulative,' according to the Pentagon. 
On Tuesday General Dynamics stock opened at $151.21 and closed at $152.59. Last week the corporation was awarded a $170 million contract for an air-to-ground rocket system. Earlier this month General Dynamics was awarded a $900 million contract over five years to provide engineering and technical services for major weapon systems, program technical assistance, support systems requirements and assist with production decision-making and program controls, according to MarketWatch . 
The United States is the largest producer and exporter of weapons in the world. The US armed forces budget topped out over $600 billion in 2015.

Myanmar's defacto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi of the National League for Democracy (NDL) political party, has paved her time since coming to power earlier this year with both irony and hypocrisy. She has not only illegally declared herself 'leader' of the Southeast Asian state in contravention of its constitution, she has also embarked on an iron-fisted purge of her political opponents identical to the one she fought against as she struggled to seize power to begin with. 
During elections earlier this year, Myanmar's constitution prevented Suu Kyi from holding the nation's highest office due to her inordinate amount of time overseas, her status of having been married to a foreign, and her children's dual citizenship. Instead of adhering to the law, her party once in power, simply contrived an entirely new post for her, State Counsellor of Myanmar, which makes her the 'defacto leader' of Myanmar. 
Canada's The Globe and Mail in an article titled, 'StÃ©phane Dion says Aung San Suu Kyi is the 'de facto' leader of Myanmar,' would note that Canada's government recognized this legal side-stepping, stating: 
Dion called Suu Kyi, now Myanmar's foreign minister, 'the de facto national leader' of her country 'because they have a strange rule that if you have married somebody who's not of the country, you cannot be the leader of the government and of the state.' 
Suu Kyi, the internationally recognized democracy advocate, is barred from becoming president because her late husband was British, as are her two sons. The rule was crafted during Myanmar's decades of military rule, which Suu Kyi fought against during years of house arrest before finally prevailing last fall. 
In essence, she is unelected, and illegally holding power. For a woman who's Western backers '“ particularly in the United States and United Kingdom '“ have held her up as a champion for democracy and the rule of law, she and her party's first act upon taking power was trampling both. The Inhumane Humanitarian 
Another myth built up around Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi by the West has been her advocacy for 'human rights.' Her advocacy for human rights, however, appears only to extend out to protect only as far as her immediate political allies are concerned. For groups beyond this self-serving political protection, and particularly regarding her political opponents, she and her NDL are just as eager to jail, crush, or kill political opponents as they claimed the ruling military government had been. 
In addition to escalating violence targeting the nation's Rohingya's population, several activists online have been sent to jail for 'insulting' the ruling government and Western-backed media fronts and organizations. 
Myanmar's Eleven Media Group (EMG) in its article, 'Facebook offender brought to court for insulting Suu Kyi,' attempted to distance what Suu Kyi and her political supporters had once called draconian censorship as now, a simple matter of enforcing the law. It would state: 
A Facebook user named Zaw Zaw (aka Nga Pha) was brought to the North Dagon Township court on October 24 to face prosecution for his defamatory posts about State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. 
He has been charged under Section 66(d) of the Telecommunications Law. 
'He's being sued for defamatory writing and photos about the State Counsellor [posted on Facebook],' said plaintiff Nay Myo Kyaw, a 34-year-old resident of North Okkalapa Township. 
Around 50 people showed up at the hearing wearing shirts affiliated with a group called the Network of Supporters of the Rule of Law. They shouted: 'You deserved it for insulting a good person.' 
The article also admits: 
The Myawady Township Court sentenced Aung Win Hlaing (aka A Nyar Thar), the first man to be prosecuted under the current government, for defamatory posts on Facebook about President Htin Kyaw, to nine months in jail after he was convicted under Section 66(d) of the Telecommunications Law. 
Aung Myint Tun (aka Ko Pho Htaung), a member of the National League for Democracy, is still facing legal action under the same law for the wording of a resignation letter. 
Another man named Yar Pyay was arrested and is being prosecuted for creating a fake Facebook account under the name of Nay Myo Wai, the chairman of Peace and Diversity Party. 
Hla Phone was also arrested and is being prosecuted for defamatory posts on Facebook about the Commander-in-Chief. 
EMG '“ ironically awarded for its work in opposing the previous military-led government by Reporters without Borders '“ would also admit that it itself had taken advantage of Myanmar's laws to silence its own critics, claiming: 
Eleven Media Group (EMG) also filed complaints about repeated defamatory posts on Facebook against the group. Though EMG lodged complaints against film director Mike Tee, who is the owner of a Facebook account named Than Tun Zaw, and another Facebook user named Myat Maw for offensive posts about the group and its staff, the legal process has yet to begin. EMG lodged the complaints on January 27 and March 31 this year. 
One would expect such a tidal wave of abuse '“ as defined by the West in regards to media, governance, and censorship around the world '“ to be met with sweeping condemnation from the West's various human rights advocacy organizations including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and a no doubt embarrassed Reporters Without Borders '“ yet the silence is as deafening as it is telling. Taking Over Where Accused Dictators Left Off 
The West's champions of democracy, rule of law, and human rights in Myanmar appears to have simply taken over right where Suu Kyi and her NDL party had claimed the military-led government left off. And despite the overt nature of Suu Kyi's breaches of Western standards of 'democracy' and 'human rights,' the US is on track to lift all sanctions from Myanmar as Suu Kyi and her government open the nation, its people, and its resources to exploitation by Western corporations. 
The overt nature of both the West's and Suu Kyi's hypocrisy illustrates that 'democracy,' 'rule of law,' and 'human rights' are merely facades behind which the West and its proxies wield their power '“ hiding behind such principles rather than truly upholding them. And in reality, such behavior undermines these principles more than any overt abuse by an openly tyrannical regime ever could '“ because genuine advocates thus become associated with hypocrites like the Western governments supporting the current regime in Myanmar, their faux-nongovernmental organizations aiding and abetting the regime, and proxies like Suu Kyi and her NDL themselves. 
International audiences must keep this example of hypocrisy in mind as the West attempts to overturn other governments in Southeast Asia and beyond under similar pretexts and using similar rhetoric '“ supporting supposed 'pro-democracy' and 'pro-human rights' advocates who have every intention of trampling both upon seizing power.

I begin this piece with three quotes from my work-in-progress, The Underground: 
'There is a media metaphysics. Its basic principle states that nothing exists until it becomes information. Now we have a new twist: information only becomes real when it reaches a mind already attuned to it. In other words, the tree falling in the forest makes a sound only if a user/consumer who wants a tree to fall receives video and audio of the event'¦' 
'Information can be dressed up a thousand different ways. But it tends to have an 'elastic' quality. By that I mean you eventually get to see the person who dressed it up. That's a problem for chronic liars who inhabit the press. They expose themselves, even though they don't want to. It takes a surprisingly small push to expose the whole operation. This is happening now, right in front of our eyes.' 
'The basis of big media is theater. News is theater. Its directors and producers think they're doing a first-rate job. But they're sadly mistaken. Gaps and obfuscations are growing larger. The outright non-sequiturs and gibberish are becoming more apparent. The audience is wising up to the farce. Who are these fools who direct the news? They're simply people who want to sell their souls and have found an elite buyer. But that transaction doesn't contain any guarantees about shelf life. Mainstream news is decaying, and the expiration date is approaching. Like civilizations, the petty princes of information rise and fall'¦' 
Globalized media. It's nice plan. Let's examine it. 
The new technocratic media is based on profiling users. There is no impactful news unless each member of the audience is surveilled and analyzed on the basis of what he already likes and wants. 
Shocking? It's to be expected. How else would technocrats parlay the untold hours they've spent sizing up their consumers/users? 
Several years ago, I wrote: 'Tech blather has already begun, since Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, bought the Washington Post at a fire sale. Jeff Genius will invent new ways to transmit the news to 'people on the go' and make the Post a smashing success. Mobile devices. Multiple platforms. Digital taking over from print. Ads customized to fit readers' interests (profiling). News stories customized to fit readers' interests (more profiling).' 
In other words, non-news. If you thought media were irrelevant and deceptive before, you haven't seen anything. The 'new news' will create millions of virtual bubbles in which profiled users can float contentedly, under the cozy cottage roofs of their favorite little separate paradigms. 
The tech giant Apple has waded into this territory with an app that will deliver news to users. Yahoo: 'Apple News, part of the upcoming iOS 9 operating system, aims to be the primary news source for users of the iPhone and iPad'¦ Apple says its news app 'follows over a million topics and pulls relevant stories based on your specific interests''¦ Joshua Benton of the Nieman Journalism Lab said the app will be important because 'through the awesome power of default, Apple distribution puts it in an entirely other league. This [news] app will be on hundreds of millions of devices within 24 hours of its debut'.' 
Translation: Profiling their users down to their toenails, Apple will present them with virtual bubbles of news they want to see and read. 
Not just one overall presentation for all; no, different 'news outlets' for Apple's audiences. 
This introduces a whole new layer of mind control. 
'You're an Obama fan? Here are stories confirming your belief in the Prophet.' 
'You want neo-con on the rocks with a conservative Republican twist? Here's some war footage that'll warm your heart.' 
'Do you believe 'government gridlock' is our biggest concern? Congress can't get anything done? We've got headlines for that from here to the moon.' 
'Tuned into celeb gossip? Here's your world in three minutes.' 
The idea: convince users, one day at a time, that what they already believe is important IS the news of the day. 
It's Decentralized Centralization. One media giant carving its global audience up into little pieces and delivering them a whole host of different algorithmically appropriate lies and fluff and no-context psyops. 
And for 'fringe users?' 'You're doubtful about GMOs? Well, look at what Whole Foods is planning for their healthier produce section. Cheer up.' Nothing about Maui voters declaring a temporary ban on devastatingly toxic Monsanto/Dow experiments or the dangers of Roundup. 'You're anti-vaccine? Sorry, you don't count. You're not a recognized demographic. But here's a piece about a little unvaccinated boy who was involved in car crash on the I5.' 
Does this sound like science fiction? It isn't. It's the mainstream look of the near-future. Search engines are already 'personalizing' your inquiries. US ABC national news is climbing in the ratings because it's giving viewers 'lighter stories,' and spending less time on thorny issues like the Middle East. 
The mainstream news business is desperately looking for audience; and treating every 'user' as a profiled social-construct-bundle of superficial preferences is their answer. 
'Mr. X, we've studied the little virtual bubble you live in, and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth.' 
'Hello, audience. We're going to pitch you on becoming full-fledged obsessed consumers, as if there is no other worthy goal in life'”and then we're going to profile you from top to bottom, to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are, so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands'¦' 
The one-two punch. 
Any actual event occurring in the world will be pre-digested by robot media editors and profilers, and then split up into variously programmed bits of information for different audiences. 
Who cares what really happened? In the new world, there is no 'what really happened'. That's a gross misnomer. A faulty idea. A metaphysical error. No, there is only a multi-forked media tongue that simultaneously spits out a dozen or a hundred variations of the same event'¦because different viewers want and expect different realities. 
In 1984 , Orwell's Big Brother was issuing a single voice into the homes of the population. That was old-school. That was primitive technology. That was achieving unity by hammering unity into people's skulls. This, now, is the frontier of unity through diversity. 
'We want to make all of you into androids, through basic PR and propaganda and a pathetic excuse for education. However, we recognize you'll become different varieties of androids, and we'll serve that outcome with technological sophistication. Trust us. We care about what you prefer.' 
User A: 'Wow, did you see the coverage of the border war in Chula Vista?' 
User B: 'War? They had a fantastic exhibit of drones down there. At least a hundred different types. And then I watched an old WW2 movie about aerial combat.' 
User C: 'Chula Vista? They had a great food show. This woman made a lemon pie. I could practically taste it.' 
User D: 'That wasn't a border war. It was a drill. And then afterwards, these cops gave a demonstration of all their gear. Vests, shields, communication devices, flash-bangs, auto rifles with silencers, batons. I watch drills all over the country. Love them.' 
User E: 'Chula Vista? The only thing I saw on the news was 'sunny and mild' this week. I watch all the weather channels. I love them.' 
BUT when a Big One comes along, like the 2016 national election in the US, the separate tunes come together and ring as one. Then the overriding need to extend Globalism's goals (in the person of Hillary Clinton) blot out every other priority. Then the major media twist whatever they need to twist. Then it's the same bubble for everyone. 
One problem, though. Major media have been lanced thousands of times by alt news sites, and by WikiLeaks and Project Veritas. This attack has exposed the truth and the Clinton crimes. 
And alt news reflects the growing interest of the public in what's actually happening on many fronts. 
The technocratic plan for the news is failing. 
It was a nice plan, but'¦ 
It's turning out to be a dud. 
Alt media are forcing public awareness of one giant scandal after another: Hillary/Obama support for ISIS; pro-vaccine liars; the collapse of Obamacare; the GMO hustle; pesticide damage'¦on and on and on. 
The result? Major media are being backed into a corner, where they must defend lies and build monolithic lies for EVERYONE all the time. The idea of creating separate news for each profiled user is collapsing. 
Major media are playing defense against the rest of the world. 
It's quite a party. 
And it has no expiration date. 
A final note: Trump, WikiLeaks, Project Veritas, Drudge, and many alt news sites created a perfect storm in 2016, raining down on major media. It was and is unprecedented. The mainstream press has been exposed down to its roots, as never before. The lying, the collusion, the arrogant sense of entitlement, the desperation, the corruption'”it's all there to see, for anyone who has eyes and a few working brain cells. Expect more to come, regardless of the outcome of the election. The train has really left the station'¦

Following the recent mass arrests of 141 people at the Dakota Access Pipeline construction site located near Standing Rock, North Dakota, an anonymous donor just donated $2.5 million to bail out everyone who was arrested at the protests. 
The news came after Tamara Francis-Fourkiller, a tribal leader from the Caddo Nation tribe in Caddo County, Oklahoma, was arrested at Standing Rock. Francis-Fourkiller was released after spending two days in jail, but her family says she was just an innocent observer in the clashes between militarized law enforcement and Native American activists, or 'water protectors.' 
[ UPDATE 11/1 4:35 pm EST: A statement from Red Owl Legal Collective/National Lawyers Guild that is advising Standing Rock has issued a statement saying the $2.5 million has not been received yet. We are waiting on confirmation from the Caddo Nation tribe.] 
According to local news affiliate News On 6 : 
Family members of Caddo Nation chairwoman Tamara Francis-Fourkiller said an anonymous donor paid $2.5 million late Saturday afternoon to release everyone arrested on Thursday at the Dakota Access Pipeline site. They said, however, that Francis-Fourkiller should not have been arrested in the first place. 
Though the donor who sent the $2.5 million remains anonymous, it appears the person is connected to the Caddo Nation tribe in some way .

Part 1 of 4 
The following is the testimony I will present pro se [without a lawyer representing me] to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission's Administrative Law Court, November 2 and 3, 2016 as a result of my not permitting an AMI Smart Meter to be retrofitted on to my electric service by PECO, an Exelon Company that provides electricity and service to the suburban Philadelphia where I live. 
This testimony addresses most of the health, legal, and constitutional issues, plus the politics involved regarding the unsafe and RF/EMF cancer-causing technology forced on consumers, along with threats of no electric service if utility customers refuse an AMI Smart Meter. 
There are four parts to the entire testimony that was 18 pages long plus 195 pages of Exhibits A-1 thru W, and other documentation I had in my brief case (not presented but as backup, if needed) that totaled in excess of three to four hundred pages of scientific documentation, published research, etc. 
Personally, I think after reading the entire testimony, which will appear in four parts, readers can understand what's involved with unsafe, fire-prone, and RF/EMF/dirty electricity-producing AMI Smart Meters when for decades utilities provided safe, non-plastic parts analog meters. Before the Administrative Law Court at the PA Public Utility Commission Philadelphia, PA '“ November 2 & 3, 2016 
Your Honor, Judge Heep and Judge Pell, Members of the PA PUC, PECO Energy Company, the Exelon legal team, and all interested parties: 
Since today is the rescheduled postponed June 27, 2016 hearing and for which I, Catherine J Frompovich, submitted written testimony five days in advance of that previous hearing as per court rules, I have decided to revise and include additional testimony interspersed into the previous 75 pages (10 pages of testimony and 65 pages of Exhibits A thru Q) that I submitted via the U.S. Postal Service and which all parties received, I presume. 
However, in view of the paramount importance, plus dire consequences, of EMFs/RFs being forced onto Pennsylvania consumers with no opt-out for personal safety and protection from 24/7/365 non-ionizing radiation emitted by AMI Smart Meters microwave technology, and my being a five-year breast cancer survivor, I submit into testimony and evidence that the PA PUC and all participating Pennsylvania utilities, not just PECO as in my case, must factor in the American with Disabilities Act Amendments, which redefine cancer as a disability, especially since there are cancer-causing effects from EMFs/RFs about which I submit into the record hundreds of documented scientific evidence as dozens of Exhibits per the Schedule of Exhibits I now introduce, plus printed documents I have with me in support of the four-page Bibliography of Pertinent Published Literature Regarding Electromagnetic Radiation, Cancer & AMI Smart Meters that I also submit into the record as Exhibit S . 
Since the ADA Amendments Act provides for three 'prongs' of what constitutes a disability, I am submitting into evidence a printout titled 'Americans with Disability Act Amendments Act (ADAAA)' pointing out appropriate and applicable sections Exhibit A-1 ; a two-page printout titled 'ADA Amendments redefine cancer as a disability' Exhibit A-2 ; along with a 43-page dossier containing about 240 published studies regarding BREAST and Other Cancers and EMF/ELF/RF Cancer Studies Exhibit A-3 ; and topping off those documents with a two-page letter dated 2 August 2016 from the foremost EMF/RF researchers, physicians and academics in the WORLD written to the North Carolina Utilities Commission Exhibit A-4 wherein in the third paragraph they state: 
Smart meters and cell phones occupy similar frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, meaning that cell phone research can apply to smart meter RFR. Smart meter RFR consists of frequent, very intense but very brief pulses throughout the day. Because smart meter exposure over a 24 hour period can be very prolonged ( pulses can average 9,600 times a day ), and because there is building evidence that the sharp, high intensity pulses are particularly harmful , the cell phone study findings are applicable when discussing adverse health impacts from smart meters. 
Those five researchers, David Carpenter, MD, Director, Institute for Health and the Environment, University of Albany Dr Lennart Hardell, MD, PhD, Professor, Department of Oncology, University Hospital Orebro, Sweden Dr Magda Havas, BSC, PhD, Environmental & Resources Studies. Trent University, Canada Dr Martha Herbert, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Pediatric Neurologist and Neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston Dr Sam Milham, MD, MPH, Former chief epidemiologist, Washington State Department of Health 
point out in the last sentence of the first paragraph, ''¦ it is imperative that the North Carolina Utilities Commission be fully aware of the harm that RFR can cause and allow utility customers to opt out of smart meter installation with no penalty.' 
Frompovich respectfully points out, and also cautions the PA PUC, that in not permitting opt outs from AMI Smart Meters in Pennsylvania during formulating its AMI SM regulations, since HB2200 stated AMI SMs were NOT to be mandated , it has breached ethical and legal standards regarding unsafe AMI SMs regarding the RFRs they emit. Various states have permitted safe electric power usage by granting and implementing AMI SMs opt outs, which the PA PUC deliberately refused in formulating its utility regulations regarding AMI SMs thereby subjecting consumers to unknown adverse health effects which, in essence, violate the Nuremberg Code since consumers' consent was not required nor asked, and their use apparently amounts to an experiment on PECO's customers. 
Again, Frompovich points to the letter addressed to the NCUC Exhibit A-4 at the end of the second paragraph wherein those researchers cite the U.S. NTP June 2016 study Conclusion in part stating ''¦adds proof to the conclusions from the human health studies that radiofrequency radiation increases risk of cancer .' 
Frompovich further elaborates that cell phone RFR exposure is elective , i.e., depending upon personal choice, use, and an individual's ability to turn off cell phones, thereby reducing and/or avoiding similar frequency microwave bands and RFRs exposures both cell phones and AMI SMs produce. 
However, harmful personal bodily RFR exposure has been mandated by PA PUC Regulations'”not HB2200/Act 129 (2008) and, therefore, is absolutely illegal, since Act 129 does not defy nor negate the Pennsylvania state constitution's 'Inherent Rights of Mankind, Section 1', but it's the Commonwealth's regulatory agency'”the PA PUC'”that is guilty of nonfulfillment, I allege: 
All men [and women] are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing and protecting property and reputation , and of pursuing their own happiness. '¦ Pennsylvania Constitution, Section 1. 
However, contrary to that Pennsylvania constitutional right is the fact that mandated AMI Smart Meter RFR exposure, because of no opt outs in Pennsylvania specifically via PA PUC Regulations not Act 129, literally provides no way to escape and/or avoid AMI SMs microwave RFRs. That is illegal and should be prosecuted criminally, Frompovich contends. Furthermore, the PA PUC overstepped its agency powers and, Frompovich contends, is guilty of committing ultra vires during its rulemaking process. 
The above five researchers Exhibit A-4 delineate cell phone and Smart Meters as basically the same 'animal' because both occupy similar frequency bands on the electromagnetic spectrum! See paragraph 3 of their letter to the NCUC for more detail, including that Smart Meters over a 24-hour period can average 9,600 pulses a day causing high intensity pulses known as 'dirty electricity .' 
I submit into the record Exhibit A-5 Dirty Electricity or Dirty Power and the 10-page report 'Why Are Electromagnetic Fields Dangerous? '“ Is Dirty Electricity Making You Sick?' including 2 charts [ Table 1 Ranking Electric Meters and Table 2 Ranking Electric Meters for Risk of Privacy and Cyber Security] from the 20-page report 'Ranking Electricity Meters for Risk to Health, Privacy, and Cyber Security,' available online at https://www.scribd.com/doc/289782183/Ranking-Electricity-Meters-for-Risk-to-Health-Privacy-and-Cyber-Security . 
The KEY dispute and multi-faceted issue of concern in Frompovich's case '“ being a breast cancer survivor in excess of five years '“ is her free and legal exercise of legal and constitutional rights to be free of the fear, exposure to cancer-causing EMFs, and/or actuality of contracting cancer due to AMI SM RFR exposures 24/7/365 in her home'”something that the ADA Amendments Act indisputably encompass, since once a cancer patient that makes Frompovich covered within one of the ADAAA prongs for all time, and also includes Frompovich's indefeasible right to protect property'” both her home and her personal body and its life processes '”including her reputation. 
That federal ADAAA must be factored into Frompovich's case since PECO has obtained federal grant monies to implement its AMI Smart Meters rollout, and the law states that any business that accepts federal grant money is mandated to abide by the ADAAA, including state regulatory agencies like the PA PUC. 
Frompovich's refusal of an AMI SM, plus her human and innate right to protect her health, body and property, are more than confirmed when those five researchers point out ''¦ the strongest evidence for hazards coming from RFR is cancer , there is a growing body of evidence that some people develop a condition called electrohypersensitivity (EHS).' See paragraph 4 of the letter to NCUC Exhibit A-4 . 
On page 2, paragraph 1 of that same letter, the researchers further point out a dichotomy in science, which is the very fact that independent research versus industry research studies are at coincidental, if not predictable , variances, as per the chart I raise up and submit into the record , a double-sided poster 'Radiofrequency Research: Does Funding Matter,' which shows two pie charts depicting those conflicting statistics. 
Non-industry studies indicate 70% harmful effects with 30% no effects, while industry studies indicate 32 % harmful effects with 68% no effects! Statistically, that's almost a wash, as each just about cancels the other, however, there's a slight edge of 2% from non-industry studies indicating harmful effects. More interestingly, though, is that industry studies DID find 32% harmful effects studies'”almost one-third of the studies and, yet, the industry concludes differently stating there are none! That alone should be a red flag for them, or anyone of scientific mind, to investigate further and they did not, which indicates some sort of collusion of not wanting to know or find out. Is that a crime of omission or collusion? 
Paragraph 2 on page 2 of that letter Exhibit A-4 cites the obvious CRUX of scientific and ethical issues regarding AMI Smart Meters in Pennsylvania, in particular, stating 'With a leading [NC] DHHS staff member admitting that he is not qualified to review the literature, and the fact that he relied on industry representatives for assistance, the DHHS conclusion is not surprising.' 
Frompovich feels compelled to question how much of that microwave technology industry representative assistance occurred, and still occurs, with and from PECO and the PA PUC, thereby illegally depriving Frompovich and all Pennsylvanians of their rights to protect their health and property, along with the exercise of redress against what amounts to experimental AMI Smart Meter science whose proponents wantonly do not recognize non-thermal adverse health effects from RFRs, which have been known since 1932! I introduce Exhibit T Electrosensitivity (ES) and Electromagnetic Hyper-sensitivity (EHS) into the record to document that in 1962, 1979, 2009 and 2015 various health issues have been identified with EMF non-thermal exposures. 
Your Honors, I respectfully ask the court to instruct PECO to produce the experimental studies, rather than epidemiological studies, indicating no non-thermal effects from EMFs/RFs. Where's the science? 
Aren't PECO's customers entitled to have that evidence? 
Frompovich also feels compelled to ask this court the following: How much influence did the microwave industry contribute to PA State Representative Robert Godshall's campaign coffers and/or his preferred charities that apparently has enabled Godshall, as Chair of the PA House Consumer Affairs Committee, to sit on opt out bills in the PA legislature for several legislative sessions, including Godshall's verbal proclamations to others that he will never bring opt out bills to the floor for a vote, which obviously is an impeachable offence for depriving Pennsylvanians of their right to redress government and government agency oppressions that enable utility companies to harass and bully customers about cutting off electric service if they refuse fire-prone AMI SMs in Pennsylvania. 
Here's what other U.S. states have done regarding AMI Smart Meters: 
Analog meters are definitively offered as the opt-out meter in four states: Arizona, California, Maine, and Texas. The Nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the 'greatest customer acceptance,' which, clearly, is the analog. 
Three states offer the 'existing meter' as the opt-out meter. An existing meter might or might not be analog. Georgia, Hawaii, and Consumers Energy in Michigan. 
Three states let the utility decide: Florida, Maryland, and Nevada. The Nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the 'greatest customer acceptance,' which, clearly, is the analog. 
Four states or utilities definitively forbid analog opt-outs: Fountain in Colorado, DTE in Michigan, Central Hudson Valley in New York (AMR), and Port Angeles in Washington (touted as the first place to ban smart meters'”not much help you are required to have a digital meter on your home!). 
Two states/districts require smart meters: Pennsylvania and Washington, DC.

By Catherine J. Frompovich 
This is the continuation of the testimony I will present before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission's Administrative Law Court November 2 and 3, 2016. 
Currently, Chairman Representative Godshall is allowing three more opt out bills to become sine die this session, which should amount to an impeachable offense for denying consumers their inherent and indefeasible rights, especially of redress to government, and also according to the Pennsylvania Constitution, I contend. 
Probably nothing encapsulates and explains the EMF/RFR controversy or conundrum, if you may, from a scientific viewpoint than the 35-page report ' EUROPAEM EMF Guideline 2016 for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of EMF-related health problems and illnesses ,' which is a Spanish language document and found online at https://listas.um.es/sympa/arc/anuncios/2016-07/msg00069.html This report cites 308 published scientific references, which leaves Frompovich to question why the PA PUC'”and PECO in particular'”are so daft in proffering that there is no updated science other than the 1940s era 'safety' THERMAL science regarding microwave electromagnetic energies based in 'ancient' radar studies the microwave industry always trots out as proof of 'safety'. 
Those 'safety' studies originated in Germany during World War II; are totally outmoded; but remain the present Federal Communications Commission's rules regarding safety of cell phones and AMI Smart Meters. It is now 2016! How come 1940s microwave technology science is being applied as the 'gold standard' or 'scientific criterion' to meters that will become the key intelligence gathering technology for the Internet of Things? Frompovich has to question the credibility factor of both PECO and the PA PUC for depending upon 1940 science in today's technology world of 2016. Where's the science later than the 1940s? Please, may I have those studies PECO supplied to the PA PUC? 
Frompovich, therefore, respectfully suggests that the PA PUC study the above-aforementioned European reports with medical and EHS health professionals, who are qualified to explain the diagnostics and varied modalities discussed, in order to issue updated regulations affecting AMI Smart Meters and their continuous RFR/EMF health-damaging electromagnetics, plus their fire-and-explosion-prone proclivities and occurrences, which definitely was not the case for all the decades utilities used safe and efficient analog meters. 
Children are the most vulnerable to EMF radiation and, therefore, I introduce Exhibit U-1 'Why children absorb more microwave radiation than adults: The Consequences,' and Exhibit U-2 'American Academy of Pediatrics August 29, 2013 letter urging the Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, the Federal Communications Commission and others to advise the public about Specific Absorption Rates (SARs) regarding EMF/RF exposures.' 
Also, I want to apprise every one of the fact that electromagnetic sensitivity (EHS) is a growing problem and according to recently reported statistics in the peer reviewed journal ECOPSYCHOLOGY, Professor Pamela Reed Gibson states the following: 26% of the USA population; 19% of the Swedish population; 27% of the Danish population; and 32 % of the German population are EHS compromised. See Exhibit V . However, other sources claim that as much as 5% of the entire world's population is affected. 
Just as chemical sensitivities were discredited and denied by medical doctors for years'”now referred to as 'sick building syndrome' or 'Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS)'”so, too, is EHS now being recognized by many, including the World Health Organization. I introduce Exhibit W 'Electrohypersensitivity: a functional impairment due to an inaccessible environment.' Printout available here https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=forums&srcid=MDgxODkwOTk5NjU5OTU4ODQwNTYBMTU3NTIzMDA1MTQxNTY1NzI0NTcBTVRzdGFEOUNBUUFKATAuMQEBdjI 
As Exhibit X I introduce a study no one can refute, 'A review on Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and the reproductive system,' which outlines science the microwave industry, PECO and all utilities utilizing AMI Smart Meters, plus public utility commissions across the USA need to factor into the inevitable legal liability that they are assuming by committing crimes against humanity by exposing the population to unsafe microwave electromagnetics 24/7/365 from dirty electricity pulsed by AMI SMs onto home wiring and into private residences and all buildings retrofitted with AMI Smart Meters. 
Before I include my previously submitted testimony, I find it necessary to impress upon the court that it should not be Frompovich's obligation to prove the medical consequences beyond a reasonable doubt, especially in light of the ADA Amendments Act as it applies to those receiving federal funding or even that the consequences of medical problems are more probable than not, since the ADAAA provides Frompovich with disability rights and protections, which PECO and the PA PUC must abide by. 
Furthermore, it should be the indisputable duty of PECO and all Pennsylvania utility companies '“ but more specifically that of the PA Public Utility Commission's stated mission for being '“ to provide safe and non-radiating innovations in utility technology and appliances with 100% certainty, which AMI Smart Meters fail on numerous levels, especially with their proclivity for 'hot sockets,' fires and explosions, EMF/RF constant emissions and dirty electricity pulses as frequent as 9600 times a day! 
No medical-scientific testing has proved AMI Smart Meters EMFs safety regarding non-thermal adverse health effects that I know of. Where's the science? 
Therefore, Frompovich should not be forced to allow a proven-fire-prone AMI Smart Meter electric service on her property that would radiate dirty electricity into her residence with high RFR pulses every fifteen seconds. 
Just to add more 'salt to the wound,' as they would say, there are no assurances that monitoring is not part and parcel of the AMI Smart Meter agenda and an integral surveillance device of the Internet of Things, or that information will be shared with unknown third parties'”for whatever reasons'”and for which Frompovich does not approve nor give her permission to PECO, the PA PUC or any government agencies or agents. 
Therefore, Frompovich feels her privacy, as well as her home and personal physiology, will be subjected to unlawful, unconstitutional and unnecessary interventions at various levels and, specifically, without proper legal processes, e.g., court-issued warrants, in order to surveil her home that automatically will occur from the two-way ZigBee radio transmitter system of AMI SMs and all 'smart' appliances which are built to interact with the coming surveillance technology of the Internet of Things. The times Frompovich makes tea in the morning and shuts off her lights for the night are no one's business but her own. 
I've been researching consumer health issues and whatsoever affects human health negatively , including technologies, since the late 1970s. During my career, I was considered an expert witness providing testimony before several states' legislature/legislative hearings on health issues. For numerous years I was ahead of both the popular curve and the allopathic paradigm of medicine regarding the role of diet, nutrition, epigenetics, and lifestyle issues in maintaining optimum health, avoiding disease and regaining health utilizing holistic health principles. 
I am in my 78 th year, thank God. Since the early 1970s, when I almost lost my life due to unfortunate medical mistakes and had to remove myself from mainstream allopathic care in order to save my life, I've been immersed in what's called the 'holistic lifestyle.' I've beaten the odds, including being a breast cancer survivor, using holistic healthcare modalities. For the record, 38.3% of U.S. adults and 11.8% of U.S. children used what's referred to as CAM in 2007 per NIH statistics[1]. Complementary and Alternative Medicine'”CAM as it's called, is popular throughout the world, while in the U.S. there is the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health. 
However, the allopathic paradigm considers it, quite frankly, a pain in its professional butt since CAM has become the 'go to' healthcare system when allopathy fails one. 
Therefore, I expect that I probably will educate misinformed individuals on the negative health consequences of electromagnetic frequencies from microwave energy producing technologies like cell phones and towers, Wi-Fi, 'smart' gadgets, and, in particular, AMI Smart Meters, which are being bully-forced onto electric, natural gas, and municipal water utility customers. Most state legislators, the media and the public are undeniably ignorant of the damage being done to their health. Fortunately, I am not one of those people, thus my refusing an AMI Smart Meter on my house. But, first I think you ought to know some of my background: I'm a well-informed, plus over 40 years published consumer health researcher, advocate-activist, journalist, and author. 
That I should be taken seriously, I offer some of my professional background: retired practicing natural nutritionist; former registered lobbyist with the U.S. Congress for five years representing holistic healthcare issues; executive director for the national Coalition for Alternatives in Nutrition And Healthcare (CANAH) for five years and, as such, presented FDA-solicited expertise input regarding holistic health practices for its 1990 OTA report OTA-H-405 NTIS #PB91-104893[2] 'Unconventional Cancer Treatments' [3]; expert nutrition witness before a congressional subcommittee opposing food irradiation; government relations specialist for a consortium of natural nutrition supplement makers before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; the first Government Relations specialist for the Life Extension Foundation, who set up LEF's government relations department; a published journalist; author of numerous books regarding health and lifestyle issues with several books available on Amazon.com and my 2016 book, Eat to Beat Disease, Foods Medicinal Qualities. 
Additionally, I wrote and produced two TV shows. One called, ' Turn Off the Violence ' was nominated for a Telly Award. That hour-long show was instrumental in securing the Giraffe Award given to persons, who stick out their necks for the common good. The recipient was George Mason University staff member Connie Kirkland[4], who founded a 24-hour crisis center for rape victims and promoted on-campus non-violence educational campaigns specifically relating to rape and domestic violence. What I've shared is much less than half of my background. More would take too much of your time. However, I feel compelled to ask, 'How many people can match my qualifications to discuss consumer health issues?' 
Furthermore, I want to underscore upfront that IF I were a habitual drug addict, rather than an informed, concerned health-conscious researcher and consumer being harassed for trying to protect and preserve my health, I probably would be welcomed with open arms, plus there would be all types of programs and subsidies available for help. Because I am opposing faulty and health-damaging RF/EMF 'science', plus vested-interest snooping, surveillance, and customer data marketing agendas using AMI smart meters, I am harassed and even threatened with termination of electric service even though all my bills are paid in full. That leaves me with no options but to dutifully invoke and defend my state and federal constitutional rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Isn't there something radically wrong with such a construct, especially in the USA, if I have to do that? 
Attorney Ward Smith's interrogatory requesting Frompovich's cancer health records, quite frankly, leaves everyone with whom I've shared that fact, totally aghast and amazed! Why? Because Frompovich's medical records are her personal information protected under HIPPA and I must protect them. Furthermore, since the PUC Administrative Law Court hearing is of public record, Frompovich does not want her personal medical records made public information during any level in these proceedings, as that is her fundamental right. 
I respectfully bring to this court's attention that my breast cancer and medical records are NOT the issue. What's the issue, problem, and at stake not only for me, but for all Pennsylvanians, is the total callous disregard by utility companies'”PECO included, the PA PUC, and the Commonwealth for health hazards, safety, and the wellbeing of all Pennsylvanians, especially those with health issues, compromised immune systems, disabilities, and especially young, growing children'”fetuses in particular'”whom RF/EMF and dirty electricity produced by AMI Smart Meters affect and impact negatively. 
Before presenting into the record additional reams of recent research with documentation and annotations'”not 1940s vintage radar safety research'”for RFs/EMFs and microwave electromagnetic energies impacts upon cancer and health, I feel it necessary to introduce something no one probably has thought about nor factored into the AMI Smart Meter hidden costs continuum , and that is, healthcare services and ancillary costs stemming from non-ionizing radiation RFs/EMFs Smart Meters impact upon human tissue. 
There are mounting underlying, long-term adverse health effects accruing as we speak from PA PUC-PECO forced AMI Smart Meter 24/7/365 RF/EMF electromagnetics, pulses, harmonics and dirty electricity, specifically adverse Non-thermal health effects, impacting children and an ageing PA population, which will generate dire fiscal consequences, plus responsibilities, upon Penna. Medicaid health cost line items in each year's operating budget for the Commonwealth. 
To cement that forewarning, I offer the World Health Organization's statistic, 'Approximately 10% of reported cases of EHS [electromagnetic hypersensitivity] were considered severe,' which means specialized caregiving. That, however, does not include cancer-induced health issues from RFs/EMFs! What kind of budget shortfall will AMI Smart Meters adverse health effects eventually generate for PA's legislature and governor to haggle about, when we've seen what's been going on recently to get a state budget passed? Has anyone thought about that very real problem?

By Whitney Webb 
Over the course of this year's US presidential election, which has been nothing if not bizarre, some have repeatedly speculated that the election may not actually happen at all if an opportunely timed terrorist attack or other major event occurred at just the right moment, leading to a suspension of the November election. Now, these theories appear to have more credence as sources within US intelligence have contacted Pat Milton, a CBS News senior investigative producer, warning him that terrorist attacks in three US states are highly likely come this Monday, the day before the US election. US Intelligence has allegedly alerted joint terrorism task forces that al Qaeda, not ISIS, could be planning attacks in New York, Texas, and Virginia. No specific locations within those three states were mentioned. 
US authorities are said to be taking the threat seriously, though CBS News ' sources stress that the threat is still being assessed and its credibility has yet to be confirmed. According to CBS , counter-terrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of an 'abundance of caution.' 
Earlier this week, there were also warnings that 'polling places' could be seen as 'attractive targets' for 'lone wolf' attackers by individuals motivated by 'violent extremist ideologies, sovereign citizen or other extremist activity.' This has led federal law enforcement to plan for several worst-case scenarios. One FBI official told CBS : 
The counter-terrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and well-postured to defend against attacks here in the United States. The FBI, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety. 
However, what's interesting here is that the terror threat is coming from al Qaeda as opposed to the Islamic State. In the Syrian 'civil' war, the US has been actively helping al Qaeda there, grouping their Syrian branch '“ the al Nusra Front '“ in with the 'moderate rebels' they support. Therefore, al Qaeda's ability to launch attacks within the US has been directly aided by US intelligence, making this announcement incredibly suspect. 
It's also worth pointing out that al Qaeda, since its inception, has been a product of the US intelligence community. In the 1980s they were essentially created by the US to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. Ever since, they have conveniently been used as the justification for an expansion of US wars abroad and the elimination of civil liberties domestically. 
It is also interesting that the threat is al Qaeda and NOT the Islamic State. The Islamic State has been the terrorist 'bogeyman' of recent years and their involvement in any threat, real or imagined, is useful justification for escalating US involvement in Syria. It seems highly likely that the Islamic State was left out due to recent revelations from WikiLeaks showing that their funding comes from the very same entities that donate millions to the Clinton Foundation. 
It is also worth noting that if a terrorist attack does come to pass, it will be a big help for Hillary. Hillary has been under siege in recent weeks due to WikiLeaks' near constant releases of her campaign chair's emails, but also due to the FBI's 'mutiny' which led them to re-open a probe into Clinton's use of a private email server. Any terror attack would give Clinton the opportunity to gain political ground by promoting her aggressive foreign policy aims in Syria and the rest of the Middle East. 
However, as mentioned at the beginning of this article, it is also possible that a terrorist attack on US soil would give President Obama the authority to either postpone or outright cancel the election, something he could not normally do except in the event of extraordinary circumstances. Unfortunately, only time will tell which theory is correct, compelling us to stay vigilant in the meantime.

An organization which has the aim to separate the state of California from the Union of the United States is set to hold a meeting at the state capitol in Sacramento on Wednesday, November 9, 2016, the day after the presidential election. 
The Yes California Independence Campaign , which is based in San Diego, describes itself as a 'nonviolent campaign to establish the country of California using any and all legal and constitutional means to do so.' 
The group is currently trying to qualify a citizen's initiative in 2018 to get a referendum for secession on the ballot in 2019, reports SF Gate . They will be in Sacramento in hopes to gather support for the state's exit, or the 'Calexit,' as they call it. 
'In our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children,' reads Yes California 's official website. 
The group's page reads on: 
Although charity is part of our culture, when you consider that California's infrastructure is falling apart, our public schools are ranked among the worst in the entire country, we have the highest number of homeless persons living without shelter and other basic necessities, poverty rates remain high, income inequality continues to expand, and we must often borrow money from the future to provide services for today, now is not the time for charity. However, this independence referendum is about more than California subsidizing other states of this country. It is about the right to self-determination and the concept of voluntary association, both of which are supported by constitutional and international law.
It is about California taking its place in the world, standing as an equal among nations. We believe in two fundamental truths: (1) California exerts a positive influence on the rest of the world, and (2) California could do more good as an independent country than it is able to do as a just a U.S. state. 
Yes California 's website lays out 9 different points covering topics the group believes will benefit from a California exit from the US, including education, peace and security, debt and taxes and immigration. 
One blog post on their page draws parallels with a 'Calexit' and the recent referendum known as 'Brexit' that passed in the UK in June which showed that most British people are ready for their country to leave the EU. 
The push for secession is nothing new to California. In 1941 the mayor of Port Orford, Oregon, Gilbert Gable, proposed the idea to push the Oregon counties of Curry, Josephine, Jackson, and Klamath to join with the California counties of Del Norte, Siskiyou, and Modoc to form a new state, later named Jefferson. 
Modoc County of Northern California voted in 2013 to join neighboring Siskiyou County in a push to secede from the State of California . 
In 2014, two counties in northern California petitioned for the right to form a 51st State of America, which they also wanted to name Jefferson.

Breaking: leaked 2008 memo from attorney Kumiki Gibson to Clinton Foundation chairman Bruce Lindsay. Gibson had been hired to do an independent assessment of the Foundation's practices. 
Below are key quotes from Gibson's findings. Keep in mind that the Clinton Foundation's very existence depends on it being legally certified as a non-profit entity, in compliance with laws governing non-profits. Break those laws and its non-profit status would be revoked, and the whole operation would go down the drain. 
Gibson: 'Important responsibilities regarding corporate filings are delegated to the [Foundation] CFO, who appears to delegate them to an outside organization, with very little oversight by the legal department. As a result, the Foundation is not in compliance with the filings rules, including in New York, which requires the Foundation to be certified to do business in the State.' [Apparently, the Clinton Foundation was not legally registered as a non-profit in New York.] 
Gibson: 'No matter what the leadership decides about the larger, over-arching question, it must act immediately to bring the Foundation into compliance with the law and standards that govern not-for-profits, and must create strong legal and HR offices so to prevent any lapses in the future.' 
Gibson: 'The Foundation does not have a record retention policy[!], and the procedures currently utilized in Harlem [headquarters] may violate the law.' 
Zero Hedge writes: 'Furthermore, and more troubling, the [Gibson] review pointed to a high-ranking but unnamed foundation executive who was 'being paid by [President Clinton], the government and the foundation' who 'allowed the foundation to host what may have been (or may have been viewed as) a political event, apparently without official pre-approval from the foundation's legal department and without regard, before the fact, to the impact of that decision on the foundation's tax exempt status.'' 
This memo was written in 2008. It would have taken then, and it would now take, about a month of investigation by New York State and US Dept. of Justice officials to nail down the particulars and sink the Clinton Foundation. 
That didn't happen then. Will it happen now? Not if the Dept. of Justice has anything to say about it. The Clintons are protected. 
But evidence of the Foundation corruption is spreading like wildfire. Some fires are impossible to contain.
