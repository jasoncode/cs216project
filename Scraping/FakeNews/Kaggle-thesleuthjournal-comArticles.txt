By: Tyler Durden, Zero Hedge | Recall that in a March 2015 interview with CBS, just after the NYT reported of Hillary's use of a private email server, president Obama told the American public he had only learned about Hillary's 'unusual” arrangement from the press. As we further reminded readers one month ago, CBS News senior White House correspondent Bill Plante asked Mr. Obama when he learned about her private email system after his Saturday appearance in Selma, Alabama. ' The same time everybody else learned it through news reports ,” the president told Plante. ' The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the BlackBerry I carry around, all those records are available and archived ,” Mr. Obama said. 'I'm glad that Hillary instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed.” Unfortunately, the 'transparency” of the Obama administration was severely tarnished in late September , when in the FBI's interview notes with Huma Abedin released by the FBI it was first revealed that Obama had used a pseudonymous email account: 'Once informed that the sender's name is believed to be pseudonym used by the president, Abedin exclaimed: 'How is this not classified?'” the report says. 'Abedin then expressed her amazement at the president's use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email.” To be sure, this was not definitive evidence that Obama was aware of Hillary's email server, nor that there may have been collusion between the president and the Clinton campaign. That changed today, however, when in the latest Podesta dump we learn that in an email from Cheryl Mills to John Podesta , the Clinton aide upon learning what Obama had just said… … countered with something quite stunning: we need to clean this up – he has emails from her – they do not say state.gov That, ladies and gentlemen, is proof that the president not only lied, but did so with the clear intention of protecting the Clinton campaign. As a further reminder, Politico previously reported that the State Department had refused to make public that and other emails Clinton exchanged with Obama. Lawyers cited the 'presidential communications privilege,” a variation of executive privilege, in order to withhold the messages under the Freedom of Information Act. It is therefore unknown what the president's 'alternative” email account was, or who hosted it. This also explains why in a prior Wikileak, Podesta told Mills in an email titled 'Special Category” that she thinks ' we should hold emails to and from potus? That's the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I(t) seems like they will. ” Mills did not respond by email. The Clinton-Obama emails were turned over to the State Department, which later announced it would not release them. * * * So just how did Mills and Podesta 'clean up” the fact that Obama lied to the American people, a tactic some could allege is evidence of an attempt to cover up a presidential lie to protect Hillary Clinton. What we do know, and we assume this is completely unrelated, between March 25-31, just a couple of weeks after Mills said 'we need to clean this up,” Bleachbit was used to wipe Hillary's private server clean. But of course, that is purely a coincidence. Since we are confident others will also demand an answer, in light of the latest revelation hinting at a collusive cover up extending to the very top of US government, or as Cheryl Mills dubbed it a 'clean up”, perhaps it is time for the State Depratment to unveil just what was said between the president and the Clinton campaign?

Reuters/Ipsos: Clinton +4 Monmouth: Clinton +12 There is a 14 point swing between the polls that show Trump up by 2 points and the polls that show Clinton up by 12 points. This should not be happening. There is no way in the world that there should be a 14 point difference between scientific polls at this stage in the game. On November 8th the polling organizations that were way off are going to be exposed, and it will be exceedingly difficult for them to regain their credibility afterwards. At this point, some of the largest news organizations in the country are openly projecting a Clinton landslide. For example, Reuters says that Clinton now has a 95 percent chance of winning … Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is on a definite path to the White House, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation poll. The survey, released Saturday, found that Clinton is on track to win more than 300 votes in the Electoral College, which would solidly secure her the presidency. If the election were held this week, Clinton would win 326 Electoral College votes while Trump would win only 212, the poll said. According to Reuters, Clinton currently has a 95 percent chance of winning the White House . If Reuters isn't right about this they are going to end up looking awfully foolish. An analysis by the Associated Press also has Clinton as the overwhelming favorite. And it is true that the poll results coming out of individual states seem to show Clinton with a seemingly insurmountable lead on the electoral map . But once again, can we trust those polls? Trump has regularly dismissed the national polls, but on Sunday his campaign manager did admit on national television that they are losing. The following comes from the New York Post … Donald Trump's campaign manager on Sunday acknowledged something her boss hates to do — losing. 'We are behind,” Kellyanne Conway admitted on NBC's 'Meet the Press.” The GOP nominee routinely brushes off negative polling as untrustworthy but Conway said Democrat Hillary Clinton does have an edge. However, it is important to remember that the big national polls have been very wrong in the past. Back in 1980, a Gallup survey that was released on October 26th showed Ronald Reagan trailing Jimmy Carter by 8 points, but of course Reagan went on to win the election by a landslide … 'For weeks before the presidential election, the gurus of public opinion polling were nearly unanimous in their findings,” wrote John F. Stacks for TIME in April 1980. 'In survey after survey, they agreed that the coming choice between President Jimmy Carter and challenger Ronald Reagan was 'too close to call.' A few points at most, they said, separated the two major contenders. 'But when the votes were counted, the former California Governor had defeated Carter by a margin of 51% to 41% in the popular vote — a rout for a U.S. presidential race. In the electoral college, the Reagan victory was a 10-to-1 avalanche that left the President holding only six states and the District of Columbia.” Could a similar thing happen on November 8th? Without a doubt, Trump supporters are far more enthusiastic than Clinton supporters are, and that matters. The key on election day is to get your voters to turn out in large numbers, and the fact that Donald Trump is drawing record crowds to his rallies is a very good sign. But even if Donald Trump legitimately wins the election, it could still be stolen from him via election fraud. In recent days Democrats have been playing down the idea that this could possibly happen, but the truth is that even Barack Obama has admitted that election fraud is a major problem in the past. For instance, just consider what he said about this back in 2008 … 'Well, I tell you what it helps in Ohio, that we got Democrats in charge of the machines,” Obama said regarding the threat of election-rigging. He continued, 'Whenever people are in power, they have this tendency to try to tilt things in their direction. That's why we've got to have, I believe, a voting rights division in the Justice Department that is nonpartisan, and that is serious about investigating cases of voter fraud.” 'That's why we need paper trails on these new electronic machines so that you actually have something that you can hang on to after you've punched that letter—make sure it hasn't been hacked into,” he added, admitting that even Democrats have 'monkeyed around” with election results: 'I want to be honest, it's not as if it's just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past. Sometimes, Democrats have, too.” I know that these comments almost sound too good to be true, but you can actually watch video of Obama making these comments right here . And it is odd that he specifically mentioned Democrats having control of the voting machines in Ohio, because I documented extreme voting irregularities in Ohio in the last election during a recent visit to Morningside . And an increasing number of Americans are starting to become concerned about election fraud. In fact, a brand new Reuters survey found that 70 percent of Republicans believe that if Hillary Clinton wins the election it will be ' because of illegal voting or vote rigging”. So even if Hillary Clinton gets into the White House, she may find that she has an exceedingly difficult time trying to govern the nation. A lot of people have made a lot of predictions about the outcome of this election, and we don't have very long until we find out who was right and who was wrong. At this point, voting has already begun in many states, and the early results in Nevada don't look encouraging for the Trump campaign … According to the estimable Nevada journalist Jon Ralston , Democrats have a 20-percentage-point turnout edge so far based on early and absentee voting in Clark County (home to Las Vegas), Nevada. And they have a 10-point edge in Washoe County (home to Reno). But in the key swing state of Florida, so far 498,153 Republicans have voted compared to just 478,175 Democrats . So that would seem to be some very good news for the Trump campaign, because Trump cannot win without carrying the state of Florida . To me it seems as though Americans are more emotionally invested in this campaign than they have been in any presidential campaign in decades. The stakes are incredibly high, and in just over two weeks we will find out what happens. Let us just hope and pray that America makes the right choice. Submit your review

in: Multimedia , US News (image credit: Justin Sullivan / Getty) ( The Real Agenda News ) More details have emerged about the never ending levels of corruption among the DNC, the Obama White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign, as a result of James O'Keefe's Project Veritas' investigation. Corrupt practices go from promoting seemingly harmless campaigns to have people dressed as ducks at Trump rallies to collusion between the Clinton campaign, the DNC and the non-profit organization Americans United for Change. In the third video put out by Project Veritas, Hillary's cohorts confess how they managed to coordinate with her campaign and the DNC to set up what can be described at the very least as provocative moves to get the Trump campaign in trouble and to have the corrupt mainstream media cover the events while blaming Trump for violent outbursts outside his rallies. As we learned from the previous two videos, it was the Clinton campaign itself the one using agent provocateurs to cause violence outside Trump rallies as these agents disguised themselves as Bernie Sanders' followers. In his second video, James O'Keefe showed how the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign, hire operatives to successfully carry out commit voter fraud on a massive scale. Scott Foval, who has since been fired, admits that the Democrats have been rigging elections for fifty years. In his first video, Rigging the Election – Video I: Clinton Campaign and DNC Incite Violence at Trump Rallies, O'Keefe showed how second and third parties associated with the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, were responsible for violence and attacks on Trump supporters all over the country. As we said before, the veil of corruption that surrounds the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party continues to fall and people can easily see what is behind their fake progressive and fake liberal masks.

in: Multimedia , Science & Technology , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests You know all of those cool, sci-fi gadgets that people are beginning to get that are connected to the internet in their homes? The voice controlled thermostats, the wireless printers and cameras, the home security systems, the food scale that sends the calories to your phone app, those 'smart” appliances that text you to pick up milk, and the DVRS that can be programmed via your phone from work? Apparently, those things may not be so smart after all because they played a big role in the cyber attack that took place last Friday. Security analysts believe that Friday's attack on popular websites such as Reddit, Twitter, Netflix, and Spotify was the first one carried out by hackers who used the ' Internet of Things. ” Here's how the Internet of Things works: Who else thinks that this is how Skynet got started? Maybe it's just me. The attack was on one service, Dyn. The massive attack took down the internet across the country. The website Downdetector provided a map that shows how much of the US was affected: The attack was on one company, and everything else fell over like a row of dominoes. All of the companies involved use Dyn , a cloud-based Internet performance management company. Dyn was the target of the attack, and that, in turn, affected other companies. Dyn is sort of like a phone book that directs users to the internet address of the website. On Friday a distributed denial of service attack, (DDoS) affected Dyn by sending thousands of messages at the same time, which overwhelmed the service. Security company Flashpoint said it had confirmed that the attack used 'botnets” infected with the 'Mirai” malware. From their site: Flashpoint has confirmed that some of the infrastructure responsible for the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Dyn DNS were botnets compromised by Mirai malware. Mirai botnets were previously used in DDoS attacks against security researcher Brian Krebs' blog 'Krebs On Security” and French internet service and hosting provider OVH. Mirai malware targets Internet of Things (IoT) devices like routers, digital video records (DVRs), and webcams/security cameras, enslaving vast numbers of these devices into a botnet, which is then used to conduct DDoS attacks. Flashpoint has confirmed that at least some of the devices used in the Dyn DNS attacks are DVRs, further matching the technical indicators and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with previous known Mirai botnet attacks. While Flashpoint has confirmed that Mirai botnets were used in the October 21, 2016 attack against Dyn, they were separate and distinct botnets from those used to execute the DDoS attacks against 'Krebs on Security” and OVH. Earlier this month, 'Anna_Senpai,” the hacker operating the large Mirai botnet used in the Krebs DDoS, released Mira's source code online. Since this release, copycat hackers have used the malware to create botnets of their own in order to launch DDoS attacks. It is unknown if the attacks against Dyn DNS are linked to the DDoS attacks against Krebs, OVH, or other previous attacks. Given the proliferation of the Mirai malware, the relationship between the ongoing Dyn DDoS attacks, previous attacks, and 'Anna_Senpai” is unclear. Coincidentally, many of the vulnerable 'smart” devices are made in China. Many of the devices involved come from Chinese manufacturers, with easy-to-guess usernames and passwords that cannot be changed by the user – a vulnerability which the malware exploits. According to the BBC : 'Mirai scours the Web for IoT (Internet of Things) devices protected by little more than factory-default usernames and passwords,” explained cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs, 'and then enlists the devices in attacks that hurl junk traffic at an online target until it can no longer accommodate legitimate visitors or users.” The owner of the device would generally have no way of knowing that it had been compromised to use in an attack, he wrote. Mr Krebs is intimately familiar with this type of incident, after his website was targeted by a similar assault in September, in one of the biggest web attacks ever seen…That attack began around 8 p.m. ET on Sept. 20, and initial reports put it at approximately 665 Gigabits of traffic per second. Additional analysis on the attack traffic suggests the assault was closer to 620 Gbps in size, but in any case this is many orders of magnitude more traffic than is typically needed to knock most sites offline. (source ) I'm sure those easy passwords and vulnerabilities aren't deliberate. China would never sneak Trojan horses into the USA, would they?

in: Corporate Takeover , Economy & Business , Science & Technology , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests Six corporate giants control most media and related content Americans consume. Comcast, News Corp., Disney, Viacom, CBS and Time Warner dominate US broadcast and cable television news, entertainment and sports, movie and TV production, theme parks, record labels, publishing, and for-profit online operations. On Saturday, the Wall Street Journal reported telecommunications giant AT&T and Time Warner agreeing to merge. Approval, if granted, would likely assure greater consolidation in both industries – benefitting corporate predators at the expense of the vast majority of consumers, giving them less choice than already, ensuring higher prices for poorer service. Hillary is a Wall Street, war profiteers, corporate predators tool, virtually certain to support this outrageous deal – likely to get FCC and Justice Department approval on her watch. Campaigning in Pennsylvania, Trump called the proposed deal another example of too few sources disseminating information to Americans, warning of 'too much concentration of power,” manipulating people, telling them how to think. As president, if elected, he vowed to oppose it. He's against jobs-killing TPP, NAFTA and similar deals. 'Our jobs are fleeing the country,” he said. 'They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries.” Hillary calls TPP the 'gold standard in trade agreements,” sure to approve what Trump opposes. He calls friendly relations with Russia a good thing, praising Putin as 'a leader…far more than our president has been,” saying '(i)f we have a (normal) relationship with Russia, wouldn't it be wonderful if we could work together on it and knock the hell out of ISIS.” Hillary's rage for endless wars to eliminate all sovereign independent governments risks nuclear confrontation with Russia, China and Iran on her watch. Trump is no peacenik, no paragon of virtue, yet he's on the right side of vital issues discussed above. Hillary should terrify everyone – on the wrong side of virtually everything mattering most, the most ruthlessly dangerous choice for president in US history. Submit your review

in: Faith , Society , US News America is never going to be great again until we deal with the wickedness in our own hearts. In recent days I have listened to so many national leaders tell us that Donald Trump is going to win the election and that this will usher in a new golden age of blessing and prosperity for America. Supposedly this is going to happen even though we continue to slaughter babies on an industrial scale, sexually-transmitted diseases are spreading at the fastest pace in decades, the percentage of births out of wedlock is more than 10 times higher than in 1940, and approximately two out of every three Christian men watch pornography on a regular basis. Even though there aren't any signs of widespread national repentance, we are supposedly going to be showered with wealth, favor, protection and good times for as far as the eye can see. You can believe this if you want, but it doesn't have any basis in reality. The truth is that we live in a nation where just about every type of evil that you can possibly imagine is spreading like wildfire. Just look at the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. According to the CDC, there are 20 million new cases of sexually-transmitted disease in the United States every year. And last year, cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis grew at a very alarming pace … Cases of sexually transmitted diseases in the United States have reached new highs, including an increase in syphilis not seen since the mid-1990s, federal health officials said in a report this week. There were 1.5 million chlamydia cases in 2015 — the last year that numbers were available — a 6 percent increase from the year before, and about 400,000 infections of gonorrhea, or a 13 percent rise , according to a report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . But syphilis cases increased to levels unseen since the mid-1990s. There were nearly 24,000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases last year, a 19 percent hike compared with 2014. We are a nation that has fully embraced the 'free love” philosophy of the 1960s. We have sex with whoever we want, whenever we want, and we don't seem to care about the consequences. As a result, the nuclear family is rapidly being destroyed. Back in 1940, 3.8 percent of all babies were born to women that were not married. Today, that number is over 40 percent . 2008 (the year Barack Obama was elected) was the very first year in our history when 40 percent of all babies were born to unmarried mothers, and we have now stayed at that level for eight straight years . If we want to make America great again, we can start by not sleeping with people that we are not married to. But of course an increasing number of Americans (especially our young people) are discarding traditional notions of love, marriage and sexuality completely. At one time we were told that the choice was between 'gay” and 'straight”, but now many people have decided that they want absolutely no limits. Miley Cyrus is among those that are now identifying themselves as 'pansexuals”. The following comes from a recent article by Jennifer LeClaire … 'My mom is like an '80s rock chick—big blonde hair. … She loves being a girl,” Cyrus said. 'I never felt that way. I know some girls that love getting their nails done. I … hated it … I don't wax my eyebrows. I never related to loving being a girl. And then, being a boy didn't sound fun to me. I think the LGBTQ alphabet could continue forever. But there's a 'P' that should happen, for 'pansexual.'” According to Google , a 'pansexual” is 'not limited in sexual choice with regard to biological sex, gender, or gender identity.” Millions of young girls look up to Miley Cyrus as a role model. We knew that this sort of thing was coming in the last days, but it is still hard to grasp how far America has fallen. And if you try to speak out against this wave of evil, you might just lose everything. For instance, the bakery in Oregon that didn't want to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple has been forced to close their doors permanently … The Oregon bakery that made news after it refused to make a cake for a lesbian couple's wedding has closed after legal battles left the business financial devastated, according to a Christian news site. Aaron and Melissa Klein, owners of Sweet Cakes By Melissa, have shut down their bakery, according to the store's Facebook page. 'We have closed Sweet Cakes. We appreciate everyone's continued prayer and support,' the post said. We live in a nation where the culture has been fundamentally transformed. According to a newly released Pew Research Center survey , an all-time high 57 percent of all Americans believe that marijuana should be legalized and only 37 percent are against it. With that kind of a margin, it is only a matter of time before marijuana is legalized all over the country. We also live in a nation that is absolutely addicted to watching other people have sex. And most Christian men cannot even speak out about this epidemic because they are doing it themselves. According to Charisma News , one survey found that an astounding 68 percent of all Christian men admit that they watch pornography on a regular basis. But even if we turned away from all of the other behaviors that I have just mentioned, there would still be no hope for our nation as long as we continue to murder babies on an industrial scale. Did you see the final debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton? During that debate, Clinton made it exceedingly clear that she is in favor of abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy. The Democratic platform openly calls for taxpayer funding of abortion and a complete repeal of the Hyde Amendment, and Bill and Hillary Clinton have made abortion one of the central pillars of their very long political careers. Their hands are absolutely drenched with the blood of dead children, and the American people are about to reward her by making her the next president of the United States . So no, I don't buy it when people try to tell me that America is on the verge of a new era of greatness. The truth is that we are a cesspool of wickedness and filth, and unless we repent we are going to reap a very bitter harvest from what we have sown for so many years. Submit your review

in: Corporate Takeover , Economy & Business , Globalism Ivory tower economists, corporate business analysts and financial experts routinely trash any discussion that America needs to institute a national economic policy that actually benefits our own country. The mantra of unchallenged doctrine that globalism is the only path for world commerce has been intensively pushed for well over the last half century. How well did the United States fare? An honest evaluation must acknowledge the diminishing middle class has paid the greatest penalty from the corporatist sedition that has destroyed internal independence and productive prosperity. Building viable enterprises that conduct useful economic activities produce needed and desirable goods and services. Good paying jobs grow when the velocity of money flows in the 'real” domestic economy. International trade can and is often advantageous if it benefits all parties involved in prosperity from the transactions. However, in the un-free framework for maximizing the corporatism structure of above and beyond any particular country jurisdiction or trade policies, the globalists have set up the exact opposite from the much lauded 'Free Trade” conduit. The next argument points out the inconsistency in Economic Nationalism in the Age of Globalism , and asks: 'Is economic nationalism a reaction to global integration, which in essence means cooptation and domination of national markets by the strongest multinational corporations of the richest nations? Neoliberal insist on the forces of the free market operating without government interference to protect the national capitalist class and workers. Naturally, neoliberals advocating global integration have come out against the tide of economic nationalism in any form. However, the same advocates of neoliberalism have no problem supporting corporate welfare in their own countries, a system that is a form of economic nationalism. When governments use taxpayer money to bail banks and subsidize corporations that is a form of economic nationalism, just as when they lobby to have products and services of their industries marketed in countries competing with similar products and services.” Note the error in the assumption that multinational corporatists have a beneficial relationship to any country that flies their business flag. In a perverted business culture which is now based upon the ' Citizens United ' court decision that confirms previous precedents that a corporation is a person, the United States has lost the leverage to reverse the international trade practices that has clearly been the vehicle for domestic economic decline. The alternative to the surrender of sovereignty and globalist blackmail can be found in paleo-conservative populism and the economic history that built America in the 19th century. Still relevant and sound as the day it was written, Pat Buchanan on Free Trade , provides the template for a rational and constructive national economic model. 'Good for global business” isn't necessarily good for US Global capitalists have become acolytes of global governance. They wish to see national sovereignty diminished and sanctions abolished. Where yesterday American businesses suffered damage to their good name for selling scrap iron to Japan before Pearl Harbor, today [war materiel is routinely exported] to potentially hostile nations. Once it was true that what was good the Fortune 500 was good for America. That is no longer true, and what is good for America must take precedence. (Source: 'A Republic, Not an Empire,” p.349 , Oct 9, 1999) 'Economic Nationalism”: trade only when it helps US Rather than making 'global free trade” a golden calf which we all bow down to, and worship, all trade deals should be judged by whether: they maintain US sovereignty; they protect vital economic interests; and they ensure a rising standard of living for all our workers. We must stop sacrificing American jobs on the altars of transnational corporations whose sole loyalty is to the bottom line. 'America First”: Tariffs; reciprocal trade; anti-dumping America's workers are being sacrificed to the Global Economy, and our leaders seem deaf to their distress. Impose tariffs on cheap foreign imports Prioritize the American Economy before the Global Economy by withdrawing from international organizations that imperil our financial stability & economic independence Open foreign markets to American products by requiring reciprocal trade policies Protect vital industries by passing tough anti-dumping legislation. A policy of Rational Tariffs Lower Irrational Trade Deficits is a course for a rebirth in economic vigor. Tariffs Can Restore America's Greatness sounds like the next topic for the Donald Trump campaign to take directly to the people. Economic Nationalism is a bipartisan issue that offers hope and practical employment for the displaced and discouraged. American companies have been punished for decades under the power elite and globalist betrayers. The Wall Street crowd despises the small investor and by inference the average hard working American. The plutocrats have built much of their ill-gotten gain on the outsourcing of an independent domestic economy. Globalism is on the precipice of a world-wide implosion. The danger is not just a planetary economic depression, but an intentional political crisis that will demand even more control and loss of access to meaningful commerce. The cries that international trade will stall to a halt will be used to economically enslave the populist further. Combat this devious strategy to stamp out the diminished vestiges of national ventures with a total rejection of the internationalist 'Free Trade” prototype. Demand for real jobs exists now. In order to achieve the opportunity for earning a living with dignity can be accomplished under a transition to economic nationalism. The discontent of the electorate is distinctly observable at the Trump or Sanders rallies. The frustration is real and the outcry is becoming louder. Nevertheless, the road to a solution cannot rely upon a government nanny state mentality. The globalist juggernaut is formidable, as much as it is destructive. In order to implement the conversion into a merchant economy, the bulwark blockage of crony finance and fatal usury need to be broken. The start to this process begins with an awakening that globalism is the foremost enemy to America. The elites and the entire establishment are hell bent on maintaining a corrupt system. Is it not time to regain our own economic destiny? Submit your review

in: Government , War Propaganda , World News The neocon Washington Post features their extremist views, urging greater war on a sovereign independent nation threatening no one. Former State Department official/current Wilson Center vice president Aaron David Miller challenged Hillary, saying '(s)he's on the hook to deliver” as America's next president. If she…back(s) down…what explanation can she use?” The Center for American Progress, founded by her campaign chairman John Podesta, called for greater use of US air power in Syria – on the phony pretext of protecting civilians. Throughout her campaign, Hillary supported escalated conflict in Syria, not resolving it diplomatically. Expect her to follow through once in office as Obama's successor, a near-certainty as things now stand. WaPo editors gave retired US Marine General John Allen and Middle East Institute senior fellow Charles Lister feature op-ed space . Both extremists urge 'bring(ing) Syria's Assad and his backers to account now” – their arguments based on a litany of deception, misinformation and Big Lies, commentaries WaPo features repeatedly, suppressing opposing viewpoints urging peace and stability. Allen and Lister: 'For 5½ years, the Syrian government has tortured, shot, bombed and gassed its own people with impunity, with the resulting human cost clear for all to see: nearly 500,000 dead and 11 million displaced. Since Russia's military intervention began one year ago, conditions have worsened…” Fact: Syria is Obama's war, orchestrated by Hillary Clinton, entirely responsible for horrific carnage and atrocities – using ISIS and other terrorist foot soldiers, supported by US-led 'coalition” air power. Fact: Russia's intervention in September 2015 changed the dynamic on the ground – a vital campaign to preserve Syrian sovereign independence and territorial integrity, what neocons like Allen and Lister want destroyed, so America can claim another imperial trophy and keep the Middle East pot boiling, Iran the next target. Allen and Lister: 'While subjecting his people to unspeakable medieval-style brutality, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has sabotaged diplomatic initiatives aimed at bringing a lasting calm to his country.” 'The most recent such diplomatic scheme was trashed not just by Assad, but also Russia, whose aircraft were accused of subjecting a UN-mandated aid convoy to a ferocious two-hour attack in September.” Fact: Syrians overwhelmingly support Assad, reelecting him democratically in June 2014, wanting no one else leading them. Fact: He's an eminently decent man, concerned about his nation and welfare of his people, doing his job responsibly, defending them from US-imported death squads. Fact: He's no 'medieval-style brut(e),” a disgraceful Big Lie claiming it – he and millions of Syrians victimized by US imperial viciousness, its genocidal mass slaughter and destruction, what neocons like Allen and Lister support. Fact: Clear evidence shows US-supported terrorists were responsible for attacking and destroying most of a UN humanitarian convoy for beleaguered eastern Aleppo residents. Allen and Lister disgracefully blamed Russia and Syria for war crimes committed by America, its rogue partners and terrorist foot soldiers in Aleppo and elsewhere nationwide. They called for more assertive US action, claiming '(t)he world will not forgive us for our inaction” – while hyping the myth of (nonexistent) moderate rebels waging (nonexistent) civil war against a sitting government both writers want toppled illegally, US-controlled puppet rule replacing it. Allen and Lister: 'The credibility of the United States as the leader and defender of the free world must be salvaged from the horrific devastation of Syria.” Fact: Syria was at peace with its neighbors until America and its rogue allies attacked it preemptively without just cause – raping and destroying the country, massacring its people, displacing half its population internally or externally. Allen and Lister urge escalating conflict, not resolving it responsibly – nor holding war criminals in America and its allied countries accountable for high crimes too horrendous to ignore.

in: Politics , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests (image credit: AP/Alex Brandon) Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote. Most Americans don't realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney's chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state. Unfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a quote from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times … 'I don't know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,” said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens. Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney . 'I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney's name,” Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House. She said that the first time she pushed 'Romney,” the machine marked 'Obama.” So she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time. 'Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,” she told Fox News. And we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago. For example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012. If that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren't even worth mentioning. And of course this didn't just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country . The reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again. In Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper … Shortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes 'switched.” The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday. And Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas … Gary and I went to early vote today…I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn't get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don't hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed. I don't know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that. A similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas … Hey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone's vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit! And of course they weren't the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon … So is there a serious problem with the voting machines? According to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots… Chambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters . Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a 'software update” on ES&S machines that otherwise 'omit one race” when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch. Let's keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump's column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done. But if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else. Despite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are 'no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate'… In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country: Nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote Close to 3 million registered in multiples states Approximately 24 million—one of every eight—voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state But despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled ' Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead '… Almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. Americans overall are more confident that the nation's votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner. Unfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media. And the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up … U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia's intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said. Now that is a real 'conspiracy theory”, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn't so serious. During this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it. The American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us. And let's watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong. Submit your review

in: Mainstream Media , Politics , Propaganda , Sleuth Journal Yes, Virginia, there really IS a poll fairy skewing the polls in favor of Hillary Clinton. Yesterday, I wrote about a brand new leak that had come my way. I read through the first 5 pages, confirmed that the two entities in the document were genuine and were really in cahoots, and quickly got out the information that the polls we are seeing with Clinton in the lead are fake. But, in full disclosure, I made a mistake. I really should have read the last 3 pages, because if I had, I wouldn't have published the document as a legitimate leak. It was full of outrageous Hollywood sci-fi 'salvage options” for the campaign that included magnetized mind control and a fake alien invasion. It's interesting to note that all of those options actually do exist – DARPA experiments on things like that , and things even creepier . However, it seems far-fetched that the Clinton campaign would/could go that far, and even more so that a business that does polls and analyzes them would have experimented with the tactics. So, I removed the post. There are enough lies and rumors going around the internet without me adding to them. That isn't the end of the story, though, because part of that document was legit. I began to do further research and discovered that the gist of the fake document was accurate. The polls in the MSM that show Hillary in the lead are being faked, and they're being bought and paid for. We're all being manipulated by the collusion of Hillary Clinton, the DNC, and the media. Their attempts at predictive programming through fake polls is so blatant that even the most oblivious people have noticed that something seems awry. It has long been a successful method of propaganda to leave in just enough truth to make the lie seem viable. In Mein Kampf , Adolf Hitler wrote (emphasis mine): All this was inspired by the principle—which is quite true within itself—t hat in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility ; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously . Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying . First of all, I found a copy of the disbursements from a Clinton-aligned SuperPac called Priorities USA Action on the website Red State Watcher . (click image to enlarge) This shows that the SuperPac paid the princely (or should I say, presidential?) sum of $391,250.00 for polls that were overwhelmingly positive to Clinton. These documents appear to be legitimate. The website Conservative Treehouse did a great analysis and posted links to the FEC(Federal Election Commission) filing PDFs from the SuperPac, as well as screenshots. Here are links to the PDF – pages 92 and 118 show that they did indeed make the payments shown above. But… When I did a reverse image search, I found the same thing on the following sites. And by the same thing, I mean exactly the same. And, these sites with conservative sounding names are all relatively new sites. I checked on Alexa.com to see how long they'd been around. Aside from Red State Watcher, which is definitely legit and has been around for a long time, here's the rundown on a few of the others. http://usapoliticsnow.com/ – since May 2016 http://incredibleusanews.com/ not long enough for statistics to be available http://truthfeed.com/ – since May 2016 Now, this doesn't say for certain these sites are fake ones, put up by the opposition, but it does cast some questions on the credibility. These stories are all based on a video alleged to be by Anonymous, but in actuality, the YouTube channel is Anonymous Patriots. Their first video was posted 7 months ago – March 16, 2016. Other sources concur that the polls being broadcast by the mainstream are skewed or outright fake. A professor at SUNY has been saying all along that Donald Trump was strongly in the lead. Back in February, Fortune magazine published an article by Dr. Northrup that showed, based on his analysis, Trump had a 97% chance of winning the election. He still stands by this opinion. Dr. Helmut Norpoth wrote a post for The Hill explaining how these polls published by the MSM are misleading. To start with something basic, opinion polls are really about 'opinions,” not actions. At their best, they can tell us how people feel about political issues and personalities. Do voters, for instance, like or dislike candidates such as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump? Yet having an opinion and acting on it are two different things. Barely 6 in 10 voting-age American citizens turn out for presidential elections. Ascertaining the opinions of 100 citizens is just a start. Now you have to determine which 60 of them actually take the time to mark a ballot. They are the 'likely voters.” They are the only ones that count. But to find them is no easy chore. It is ingrained in all of us that voting is civic duty. So nearly all of us say, oh yes, I'll vote, and then many will not follow through. Dr. Northrup is not alone in his claims that Trump is far, far ahead of Hillary Clinton. The website Govt. Slaves reported on a polling app called Zip back in August. Despite a majority of opinion polls showing the 2016 presidential election going to Democrat Hillary Clinton, a smartphone app developer says his data suggests challenger Donald Trump will be the victor. 'Based on the stats we see, he looks strong,” says Ric Militi, co-founder of San Diego-based Crazy Raccoons, maker of the Zip question and answer app. His app poses questions and polls responses based on an average of 100,000 daily users. 'I go with Trump, based on what we see.” Breitbart showed evidence of Reuters ' back rigging” the polls in Georgia to indicate a Clinton victory. Speaking exclusively to Breitbart News, political polling pioneer Pat Caddell said the Reuters news service was guilty of an unprecedented act of professional malpractice…”This comes as close as I have ever seen to cooking the results ,” said the legendary pollster and political consultant. 'I suppose you can get away with it in polling because there are no laws. But, if this was accounting, they would put them in jail.” … 'The looks to me, are far as I can indicate, they have merely decided to go back and revise their numbers in a formula that removes voters or allocates them–I am not sure how they are doing this–proportionately,” he said. Reuters has rejiggered its methods in order to get the results they want, said the man , whose out-of-the-box interpretations of the American electorate were the brain-work behind the insurgent presidential campaigns of Sen. George McGovern (D.-S.D.) in 1972, Georgia Gov. James E. 'Jimmy” Carter in 1976, President Carter 1980 and Sen. Gary Hart (D.-Colo.) in 1984 . Millenium Report concurs about the poll-rigging. In view of so much fake poll data that is systematically dumped into the public domain by the MSM, the American people being gradually conditioned to believe that Clinton is really ahead in this race. With each passing week the Clinton numbers increase by 5 or 10% which should put her with 175% of the populace by now. Yes, there contrivance of poll numbers is that ridiculous. 2016 Election Being Rigged By The Hour, Polls Fraudulent, Clinton Popularity Grossly Exaggerated These same fraudulent tactics were utilized during the democratic primary with much success. Bernie Sanders' loss was the direct result os so much fixing and rigging, manipulating and scheming. That Sanders himself permitted all the fraud is the biggest scandal of all, particularly after he heartily endorsed Comrade Clinton for president. Such a transparent betrayal of his once loyal will most assuredly push many voters over to Trump. But here's the real conspiracy. I think there is a Clinton-based conspiracy to cast doubt on everything coming out of the opposition, which in turn reinforces everything coming from them. First of all, vet your sources. Here's how. When you see an article from a source you don't recognize, go over to Alexa.com and paste in the homepage address. You'll see a chart that shows you how long the website has been around, and below that will be the global and national ranking of the site. This isn't conclusive, of course. There are legitimate new websites popping up all the time, but I have to think that some of these more outrageous, allegedly 'conservative” websites could be new websites started by those who want Hillary Clinton to be in office. These sites can perpetrate all sorts of wild rumors and fake documents and this has a two-fold effect. Most importantly, these types of stories cast doubt on the real leaks that are out there. What better way to discredit the massive information being provided by Wikileaks than to mix in a bunch of fake leaks? People without critical thinking skills will extrapolate from this: 'This leak is fake, so all the leaks must be fake. Holy cow, they're lying about our Queen Hillary.” Secondly, crazy rumors being spread through conservative and libertarian sources make us all look…well, crazy. If we are dispensing inaccurate information from questionable sources, then everything we say becomes subject to more doubt. The Gateway Pundit shows an actuarial review that determined Trump could possibly be looking at a landslide victory. With all the liberal distortions and dishonesty we decided to have a small team of actuarial and statistics professionals take a look at a couple of the recent polls to get their take on the reliability of these polls. They selected the recent FOX poll from October 14 showing Hillary up by 7 and the WSJ/NBC poll from October 16 showing Hillary with an 11 point lead. The first observation is that both polls are heavily skewed towards Democrats. At a high level, the FOX poll consists of 43 Dems to 36 Reps to 21 Other while the NBC poll shows 44 Dems to 37 Reps to 19 Other. By selecting more Dems the polls are designed to provide a Dem result. Our experts next analyzed the data and calculated results using the same data from the two surveys on a split of 40 Dems, 40 Reps and 20 Other. The results show that using either sets of data Trump comes out ahead with a larger margin of victory using the FOX data. Clearly the polls using data that is heavily weighted towards Democrat voters is incorrectly skewed. … it is difficult to determine what the independent voters will do but many independent voters partook in the primaries to vote for Trump. Therefore it is more likely that Independent voters vote for Trump as well. If more Democratic voters vote for Trump than Republicans vote for Hillary and more Independents vote for Trump than Hillary, both scenarios which are highly likely, then the results of the general election will likely be a Trump landslide . It's easy to see how this supports the possibility of a stolen election. Remember during the debate when Donald Trump refused to say that he would accept the outcome of the election if it wasn't in his favor? Not only has Camp Clinton been caught more than once rigging the election, they're redoubling their efforts in social perception. Here are a few ways they're doing it: The discrediting of websites who are open about their dislike of Hillary Clinton. The fake polls that assure everyone that Clinton's victory is guaranteed. The manipulation of public opinion through false reporting in the MSM. Potentially putting up websites with fake conservative names in order to spread misinformation in the hopes that other conservative websites will make the posts go viral, then 'disproving” the rumor they started themselves. Coincidentally (or not), I've spent hundreds of dollars over the past few weeks because my websites have been hacked. I'd love to know if any other alternative media sites are having these issues.

in: Consciousness , Government Corruption , Society , Special Interests , US News No event in American history (if you ask me) has been more engineered, more anticipated and more built up than the upcoming November 8, 2016 presidential election. Face it. This presidential election season made the truth movement mainstream. Evil and corruption was brought into the light. We've observed what a George Soros-like engineered regime breakdown looks and feels like from the inside, our side this time. We had heard and read about all those foreign governments that the US overthrew with their 'democracy” tactics using 'special forces”, NGO's, paid-for revolutionaries, activists and in some cases flat out murderous fighters (ISIS, moderate rebels). This time the engineered chaos was happening here in the US. This 2016 election season has been packed with outright exposed corruption, lies, propaganda, murders, stolen primaries, fabricated accusations, distractions, staged debates and much more. We have seen a criminally accused presidential candidate get away with crimes in broad daylight while suspected of suffering from Parkinson's disease, passing out, having seizures and even being followed around by a creepy doctor with a seizure medication injector. This is the stuff Hollywood films are made of. The list of the insanity goes on and on, right? We've witnessed plenty of lies, propaganda and Jerry Springer show-like attacks by the candidates to create just the perfect smokescreen so that Americans are not looking into the events in Aleppo or Mosul much less the Hillary-DNC- mainstream media corruption scandals and revelations. Instead of keeping a close eye on the doings of the US criminal empire, the elite relied on a very in-your-face and increasingly arrogant, defiant and now very busted and discredited mainstream media to push the desired paradigm and reinforce it every which way they can. Actually, this understates the situation. What really happened was that the mainstream media joined forces with the chosen candidate of the ruling oligarchs (Hillary) and together their campaign (the DNC-Hillary-Soros-Moveon.org-Michael Moore-Hollywood-mainstream media complex) has brought us to the ending that truth seekers are now looking ahead to with great anxiety and anticipation. Actually, I'm understating the situation again. All or most Americans (awakened or not) are anticipating and anxiously awaiting the end results of the US presidential elections. The question we should all be asking then is, how did we get here? Oh, and perhaps more importantly, where are we going? And to answer this, one must realize that the ruling elite have plans. They have a lot of money and they have players willing to go along with their plans. Not sure of this? Then please research Sandy Hook or Boston bombing events. Or research many of the crisis actor events of the past few years. That's right. While they were staging one event after another, too many Americans were too busy and too afraid to call these fake events for what they were. Too many Americans fell for the trick that we were supposed to believe mainstream media 'stories” and narratives unless we could 'prove” that the account didn't happen the way mainstream media said it did. In other words, many Americans were tricked into believing that unless proven otherwise, we should BELIEVE mainstream media. Well here we are in October of 2016 and finally (though it has been common knowledge to many of us for a long while) the illegitimacy of the mainstream media is carved in stone. No longer can it be considered a 'conspiracy” by anyone, that mainstream media is corrupt and acts as a tool of psychological terrorism against the public on behalf of the ruling elite. That said, now it is time to confront the fully engineered and long planned ending of this 2016 US presidential election. Will staged ' political terrorism ', a term just introduced a couple of weeks ago into the American psyche, be staged as Mike Adams at Natural News is writing about ? Will this 'terrorism” or planned 'event” mark the beginning of the end of America? If so, what will happen? How will it all go down? Many are now wondering how deep is this web of corruption and how far will the traitors identified before us be willing to go to destroy America? The one thing everyone should accept is that this ending has been planned just like so many 'events” of the past several years have been scripted and planned. So today I invite readers to acknowledge this very important singular factor in today's events. The fact that they are planned. The notion of organic and spontaneous results is something the ruling elite hate. They hate anything that is organic, spontaneous, unpredictable, people-powered, natural and real. They need everything to be controlled, scripted, planned, orchestrated, engineered. Do you see a pattern here? One consciousness longs for freedom, naturalness and spontaneity, the other longs to control, orchestrate, engineer and dictate the ending, like a master would want to control his slave. Understanding this fundamental contrast between the control freak consciousness (think ruling elite) and the free spirited consciousness desiring to simply be free, will allow you to see what's coming this November 8th 2016. What's coming is a long awaited day for which the ruling elite have paid a lot of money and hired many people to manipulate and control the ending of. So the real question is, will their operation succeed? Looking at the election day ending from a birds-eye view and seeing how the ruling elite think and operate it is not difficult to see that they too are waiting for that day so that they can implement whatever plan they'll need based on the materializing reality at that moment. In this (what I'll call) wait-and-see plan whose execution of plan will either be entirely controlled from the beginning or be an adjusting reaction-based plan to be determined by the emerging reality, we can be sure that at no point will the ruling elite accept an ending that ruins their plan. In other words they will adjust their plan as often and as desperately as possible and necessary to engineer an ending to their liking. This ultimately is all we need to know to plan our (truth seekers and freedom lovers) next move. And our next move should look something like this if you ask me: 1- Have a plan including options for self-sustaining yourself and your loved ones (food, water, shelter and other personal needs) 2- Expect corruption but continue fighting and exposing the perpetrators. Let's not let one of these traitors (including crisis actors and operatives working for the state) get away with what they have done. 3- Don't rely ONLY on the internet to keep track of developing events. You might want to write down current event information or better yet print out key articles and documents (proof). Also download important videos don't assume these videos will always be available on YouTube or the internet. Remember we are entering a much more volatile and intense information war age. The main point is we need to archive the evidence against those criminals who have betrayed America and humanity. 4- Beware of layered psychological operations. Question everything you hear and don't discount that some 'news” is designed for you to hear it (get it?). Unfortunately the controllers have indeed upped the anti when it comes to the information war. In deceptive times like these grabbing on to the principles you believe in become much more important than agreeing with someone on every little nuance about a particular event. Stay oriented and remember who the bad guys are, especially as we see the Hillary-mainstream media complex laughably blaming Russian president Vladimir Putin for all the now-revealed corruption and criminality of the Clintons, the mainstream media, the DNC and many others. Now is the time to confront the very real and very relevant inherent concepts of truth versus lies, lightness versus darkness, freedom versus slavery and knowledge versus hidden knowledge (the occult) because this, my friends, is what we are dealing with. We (truth seekers) are all in this together. We didn't ask to be put in this show, it sort of came to us. Perhaps we (awakened humanity) are fulfilling a role that we cannot fully understand. This species we call humans needs some members of it's kind to save the rest of the species and if you are reading this then you are probably a chosen vessel in this battle for humanity. There is nothing to fear for the ending has surely been scripted. We (like them) will also respond in real-time in the most effective way possible. What we need to do more than anything else is …. (pay attention) … think ahead just like they do. And so today I'm thinking ahead. I have plans for both scenarios (Trump or Hillary declared victory). I have plans for no 'political terrorism” and political terrorism, shock or no shock, chaos or no chaos. In my world the problem remains the same until we hold these corrupt ruling elite, their politicians and players all responsible for their criminality and corruption. Plain and simple, the ruling elite must be identified, stopped and held accountable for their crimes against humanity and the US constitution. This is more important than any presidential election. Will a Trump victory make this accountability more possible? Many are hopeful of this but ultimately we must find a way to impose our will on the future and not rely on a politician to do this for us. Finally, I'm reminded of the very last line of the film ‘ The American Dream ‘ when the villain asks 'what do you think this is?” and the answer 'this is AMERICA!!”. Likewise, let's remember, this IS America, the politically hijacked land that guarantees each and every individual inherent rights which are clearly and indisputably outlined in the US constitution. Will an opportunity present itself for the rule of law to be restored or will the ruling elite have their way? That question will very likely be answered at a time not necessarily coinciding with election night. This is a reminder to all that the battle we face for humanity and truth is continuous and very long term not about one isolated moment or day. Submit your review

in: General Health Every once in a great while, a perfect child is born. One who never cries, sleeps all night, and gladly eats whatever food you choose to put in front of them. But unfortunately for most of us with children, developing lifestyle habits, such as a healthy appreciation for nutritious fruits and vegetables, usually requires years of continual work. New information recently released by researchers at Michigan State University's College of Nursing helps to shed some light on the problem of establishing healthy dietary preferences in young children, and more importantly, may help both parents and medical professionals find more effective ways to approach it successfully [ 1 ] . Does Your Diet Really Affect Your Child's? In order to better understand the connection between mother's dietary habits, and those of their children, researchers questioned almost 400 low-income women from all over the state with pre-school-aged children then currently enrolled in educational head start programs. They found that the children whose mothers ate fewer than four servings of fruits and vegetables per week were less likely to consume the recommended number of servings themselves. Perhaps more interesting, was their discovery that children who were viewed as 'picky eaters” by their mothers were also likely to consume an inadequate number of servings per week, regardless of the mother's own dietary habits. This has led the researchers behind the study to speculate on improved methods for encouraging better eating habits in children. Many nutritional specialists have become increasingly focused on making healthy foods appear fun and therefore more appealing to kids. And while a certain amount of progress has been made following this approach, it is far from a stand-alone solution. Tips for Being a Better Influence for Your Child's Diet In today's busy world, it's easy to fall into a routine of serving your family convenience foods — especially when dealing with young children and toddlers, whose taste buds can be very difficult to please. Still, the importance of developing smart dietary habits early in life cannot be overstated. Without a balanced and varied diet, growing bodies don't get the vitamins and minerals they need to thrive. By focusing directly on the food choices of mothers, experts may be able better influence the diets of their children. This is likely due to a combination of positive modeling and increased access to more nutritious foods. There's more to it than just working a few extra vegetables into dinner. (Although cooking meals at home instead of eating out every night is a smart first step for some.) Make sure that fresh snack options are also readily available for those in-between bouts of hunger. Not only is this better for your family's health, replacing pr-epacked commercial snack products with seasonal organic fruits and vegetables or raw nuts and seeds is a great way to save money in the checkout line. Parent's of so-called 'picky eaters” should also keep in mind that some children may need to be exposed to a given food as many as 15 times before they are able to decide whether or not they like it. So don't give up just yet on convincing your little one that broccoli is good. In the long run, it'll be worth the effort. References: Jill Vondrasek, Jason Cody.

in: Big Pharma , FDA , GMOs , Government , Government Corruption , Medical & Health , Special Interests There was a time when 'FDA Approved” was a vote of credibility. We could purchase a product and feel safe because the government watchdogs had checked it out thoroughly before allowing it to be sold. Now, 'FDA Approved” means 'The company that produced this product has enough money and clout to allow it to be sold.” Many people rely on the FDA as a source of knowledge and safety. Their recommendations mean something to folks who feel as though someone is watching out for them and that in America if something was bad, the government wouldn't allow it to be sold. They believe that the drugs are tested and approved for our benefit and that the manufacturers of Big Pharma are at the mercy of the fierce protectors who are advocating for the people. Unfortunately, it couldn't be further from the truth. This is all part of the giant marketing deception perpetrated on a trusting public. Some people are so snowed by what the FDA does that they want it to be even more powerful . There is actually an 'alliance for a stronger FDA” whose mission reads like a diary entry from a hostage with Stockholm Syndrome. With responsibility for products that comprise more than 20% of all national consumer spending, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) oversees aspects of several industries that are key to our nation's growth and prosperity. A science-based, predictable, and efficient FDA helps these industries — including the food, drug, medical device, and cosmetics industries — to innovate and to create high-paying jobs here in America while improving our balance of trade. The Alliance for a Stronger FDA works to ensure annual appropriations that will adequately fund the FDA's essential missions, and we believe that the American people expect this too. There is no backstop, no other agency, that performs this critical work. The federal g overnment gives the FDA about $8 per year for each American (an 'appropriation” of $2.561 billion for FY 2014). Nowhere else in the federal budget does so little money need to go so far. The FDA has just 10,000 employees to monitor food safety, review the safety and efficacy of medical products, assure the safe use of those medical products, and protect the American people, their pets, and their farm animals from poorly made, counterfeit, and illegal food, drugs, and cosmetics. Recent research on a variety of topics has led me to note some astonishing facts about the GMO Food and Drug Pushers Administration. Like a bad penny, it seems whatever topic I'm looking into, the FDA keeps turning up. The FDA has a central role in the increasing tyranny in the United States and we, as taxpayers, are funding them to do this. Be warned, you aren't going to like what you read below, but unless you are mired in intractable cognitive dissonance, you're going to see a pattern of abuse and deception. The FDA's Perpetual Conflicts of Interest First of all, it would be nice to believe that the group who decides whether foods and medicines are safe for our consumption is unbiased and benevolent. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Let's take a look at the leadership – the head of the snake – and the ties of those leaders to Big Agri and Big Pharma. Some previous tsars/commissioners are: 2016: Dr. Robert Califf Califf is a cardiologist who was a tenured professor at Duke University School of Medicine. He's long been criticized for having deep financial ties to Big Pharma. He worked closely with drug companies and convinced them to do large, expensive clinical trials that were very profitable for Duke. Califf was a paid consultant for Merck Sharp & Dohme, Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, and Eli Lilly per ProPublica from 2009 to 2013. In the disclosure information for an article published in the journal Circulation in 2013, Califf shared that he was a consultant for Gilead – the drug company that recently came under scrutiny for outrageously priced hepatitis C drugs. The price for a 12-week course of treatment with one of the drugs was initially set at $84,000 . 2010: Michael Taylor Taylor's most recent resume entry: VP and attorney for Satan Monsanto. One of Taylor's 'accomplishments” for Monsanto was writing the rules that allowed recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone into the American food and milk supply, and forcing dairies who labelled their milk as rBGH-free to also state that there was 'no difference between their hormone free milk and the chemically enhanced milk.” 2009: Margaret Hamburg Hamburg served on the board of directors of Henry Schien, Inc. previous to her appointment to the throne of the FDA. Henry Schien, Inc. produces amalgam dental products – products that contain toxic mercury. Hamburg spearheaded the legislation that allowed mercury to be allowed in dental products (without a required warning for the consumers) during her time at the FDA. Hamburg was recently named as one of the defendants in an $800 million RICO lawsuit . The suit accuses Hamburg of playing a role in a conspiracy to approve Levaquin, an antibiotic drug known to cause severe (and even deadly) side effects, in order to financially benefit her husband's hedge fund which held very large financial positions in Johnson & Johnson, makers of the drug. 2006: Andrew von Eschenbach A Bush family friend, von Eshchenbach has a background as a drug peddler for Big Pharma and as the head of the National Cancer Society. Some highlights of his reign over the FDA were the speedy approval of Avandia, a medication for diabetes that had the unfortunate side effect of a 43% increase in heart attacks among those taking it; and accusations of corruption and intimidation by the FDA's own scientists. **** But if that cast of characters isn't enough to shed doubt on the veracity of any claim made by this organization, take a look at the following facts and tell me that they're looking out for people instead of corporate interests. The FDA seems to be busily striving to regulate the family farm right out of business. The FDA has gone 'SWAT Team” on producers of raw milk and cheese, performing armed raids on small farms , seizing and destroying inventory and handcuffing farmers to haul them off to jail. The FDA keeps adding 'food safety” requirements to small organic farms while doing nothing about the factory farms' abundant use of pesticides and toxins. The FDA pushed the Food Safety Modernization Act which could eventually shut down farmer's markets across the country – or at least make the food more difficult and expensive for farmers to produce. According to the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition (NSAC), 'The regulations could erect new barriers to these important markets for small and mid-scale farmers unable to bear the expense of compliance.” Find the regulations here. With all of these new (time-consuming and pricey) legislations that farmers must adhere to , the price of local organic produce is skyrocketing, making the product unaffordable for most Americans. This, in turn, reduces competition for the huge factory farms and their GMO-tainted, chemical-sprayed products, allowing a huge profit at the end of the day for Big Agri. The FDA crackdown on health food stores and promoters of natural remedies is reminiscent of cops raiding a meth lab full of junkies. Since 1987, facilities such as the Life Extension Foundation, vitamin manufacturers, health food stores, natural pet food stores and naturopathic medical clinics have been raided by agents waving assault rifles. Owners and employees have been arrested and convicted of crimes. Countless merchandise and literature has been confiscated. What was the crime committed by these natural healing companies? They don't tithe to the Church of Big Pharma. The FDA is busily 'harmonizing” the United States policies with Codex Alimentarius . Codex is the United Nations' sinister plot to be in control of the food consumption of the world, as per Agenda 21 . Codex promotes chemical agriculture, heavily medicated livestock and genetically modified produce. It's all done under a do-gooder disguise – the CA Commission states its goals as 'protecting the health of consumers, ensuring fair trade practices and promoting coordination of food standards.” Codex actually outlaws the sale of vitamins of beneficial dosages, as well as natural remedies. According to Mike Adams , the founder of Natural News, 'the FDA will 'harmonize” the U.S. food and dietary supplement industries with global Codex requirements which make illegal virtually all healthy doses of vitamins and minerals. Under full Codex 'harmonization,” America will be left with a dead food supply and the health food stores will be virtually stripped bare of dietary supplements. Selling vitamin D at a reasonable dose such as 4,000 IU per capsule will be criminalized and products will be seized and destroyed by FDA agents who recruit local law enforcement to bring in the firepower.

in: Government , Government Corruption , Obama Exposed , War Propaganda , World News October 20 marked the fifth anniversary of Muammar Gaddafi's sodomized-related death – US imperial viciousness responsible for his murder and destruction Africa's most developed, socially responsible nation. Endless violence and chaos replaced a society safe and fit to live in. Gaddafi provided Libyans with important benefits Americans can't imagine. More on this below. Hillary orchestrated war to eliminate him, wanting US-controlled puppet governance replacing Libyan sovereign independence. In early 2011, made-in-the-USA protests preceded US-led NATO terror-bombing, indiscriminately massacring civilians, creating charnel house conditions. Endless violence continues daily, exacerbated by ISIS fighters infesting parts of the country, Washington supporting them with funding, weapons and other material aid. Obama and Hillary wanted Gaddafi eliminated for instituting policies all nations should embrace. Previous articles discussed them. He supported pan-Africanism, a United States of Africa free from imperial domination. He wanted Libyans sharing in the country's oil wealth, a notion foreign to America and other Western powers. Under his 1999 Decision No. 111, all Libyans got free healthcare, education, electricity, water, training, rehabilitation, housing assistance, disability and old-age benefits, interest-free state loans, as well as generous subsidies to study abroad, buy a new car, help couples when they marry, practically free gasoline, and more. Literacy under Gaddafi rose from 20 – 80%. Libya's hospitals and private clinics were some of the region's best. Now they're in shambles. Vital public services he provided no longer exist. Pre-war, Libyans had African's highest standard of living. Homelessness was nonexistent. Gaddafi believed all Libyans had a right to a home or rent-free apartment, notions unheard of in the West. He rejected farcical Western-style money-controlled democracy (sic), deplored crony capitalism and neoliberal harshness. During his tenure, women had the right to vote, participate politically, as well as own and sell property independently of their husbands. Clause 5 of Libya's 1969 Constitution granted them equal status with men, notably for education and employment. In January 2011, weeks before US-led NATO naked aggression began, the UN Human Rights Council praised Gaddafi for instituting and supporting important political, economic, education, social and cultural rights. He called his Great Man-Made River (GMMR) development of an ocean-sized aquifer beneath Libya's sands the 'Eighth Wonder of the World” – wanting all Libyans sharing in its benefits. Washington and rogue Western partners wanted it privatized for exclusive corporate gain. Under Gaddafi, the Central Bank of Libya was state-owned, the interest-free Libyan dinar used for productive economic growth, not speculation, profits and bonuses for predatory bankers. He funded Africa's only communications satellite, saving hundreds of millions of dollars for low-cost incoming and outgoing calls. He provided two-thirds of the $42 billion needed to launch a public African Central Bank, Monetary Fund and Investment Bank. He supported a new gold standard, replacing dollars with gold dinars, aiming to provide real monetary wealth and value, free from predatory Western lending agencies. Washington wants dollar hegemony, maintaining it as the world's reserve currency, an agenda challenged by Russia, China and other nations, increasingly trading bilaterally in their own currencies. Russia's Vladimir Putin is threatened. Neocons infesting Washington want regime change. His redoubtable leadership prevents it. Will nuclear war on Russia follow Hillary's ascension to power next year? Will the unthinkable become reality? Submit your review

in: False Flags , Gun Control , Multimedia , Propaganda , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests , US News Non-profit Headed Up By Career Marketers In the first two years of its existence the Sandy Hook massacre event's premier fundraising organization has raised close to $6 million–an average of $3 million per year. In 2013 and 2014 alone the nonprofit pumped the American public and larger donors for $5,809,367, according to the most recent IRS filings of the organization. The lofty figure shouldn't come as a surprise given the marketing talent heading up the organization and the fact that major news media have vigorously promoted the event without ever questioning its veracity. Tim Makris is Sandy Hook Promise's full time Executive Director. Mr. Makris, who claims he had children attending Sandy Hook Elementary at the time of the December 14, 2012 incident, brings twenty years of marketing and public relations experience to the project. As Makris' LinkedIn profile reveals, he developed his skills in the corporate sector at Thule Inc., Procter & Gamble, and Schering-Plough Health Care. Below is the performance of this savvy salesman at the inauguration of the Sandy Hook Promise money juggernaut. Here is another video pitch Makris made to the Brookings Institution, where he explains in no uncertain terms Sandy Hook Promise's public relations strategy to reshape US gun laws. Sandy Hook Promise has close ties to the world of finance as well. The chairperson of its Board of Directors and another of its four corporate officers is Kristin Lemkau, Chief Marketing Officer of major global investment bank JPMorgan Chase. image credit: youtube And perhaps unsurprisingly Sandy Hook Promise is overseen by individuals representing the news media. The organization's vice chair is Rob Cox , a founder and global editor of Reuters BreakingViews. News entrepreneur Rob Cox is a corporate officer of Sandy Hook Promise. Image Credit: University of Vermont According to a profile of Cox published by his alma mater, The University of Vermont, 
Within twenty-four hours of the massacre of twenty-six children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Cox and a circle of friends were working to found what would become Sandy Hook Promise, an organization dedicated to healing their own community and doing all it can to make sure others do not suffer the same fate. The degree of such caring is frankly difficult to comprehend. In other words, hours before Connecticut Medical Examiner H. Wayne Carver II stumbled through his press conference on December 15, 2012, explaining how parents were prohibited from viewing the bodies of their slain children, good-hearted souls like journalist Cox, professional marketer Makris, and banker Lemkau were scheming to cash in on the event. After all, this is what a community of like-minded souls is all about. James Belden the fourth and final Sandy Hook corporate officer. In addition to serving as a Newtown Commissioner, he also brings marketing experience to Sandy Hook Promise. Before funerals were even held for the deceased children or the results of a satisfactory crime scene investigation were close to completion Commissioner Belden was before television cameras promoting another non-profit, 'Newtown United” and its promotion of 'the underlying issues that caused this horrible incident–not just gun control but mental health and awareness.” Sandy Hook Promise is presently directing its marketing prowess toward leaning on US public schools to enforce certain mental health protocols on children; what it terms 'mental health first aid” that will purportedly prevent 'another Sandy Hook.” Sandy Hook Promise spokeswoman Nicole Hockley. Experienced marketers position the nonprofit to receive a large amount of 'free publicity” via corporate news media. Sandy Hook Promise spokeswoman Nicole Hockley. Experienced marketers position the nonprofit to receive a large amount of 'free publicity” via corporate news media. The millions solicited by Sandy Hook Promise thus far is merely a fraction of an estimated $130 million in federal funding and private donations brought in by Sandy Hook related charities. 'The latest edition of the video We Need To Talk about Sandy Hook lists a total of $131,009,229 in grants and donations, including the $50 million for the new school,” academic researcher Vivian Lee notes , but this is only a partial accounting. Indeed, the total amount of money raised to date cannot easily be calculated. A 2014 Connecticut report on charitable donations lists organizations such as The Animal Center, Inc., Newtown Forest Association, Inc., Sandy Hook Arts Center for Kids, and Angels of Sandy Hook Bracelets, all raising funds in the name of Sandy Hook Elementary.

Consider that even John Rinaldi, the convicted stalker of film actress Brooke Shields, oversees a Sandy Hook charity, 'Sandy Hook Kids Center.” 'We are actively/tirelessly/relentless fighting on behalf of our kids,” Rinaldi proclaims on the organization's website .

By: Voice of Reason | Facebook has done some pretty bad stuff this last year. They spent a lot of money and personal resources to help Hillary Clinton out during the election, but not any more says CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg! After the liberal media tried to make him turn on one of his oldest friends, Peter Thiel, for donating to Donald Trump , Zuckerberg finally decided to fight back. Since Zuckerberg is still technically supporting Hillary for President, in the following video I suggest what his real motive may have been for lashing out with pro-Trump rhetoric, and why the person he's defending doesn't win Zuckerberg any humanitarian awards either… He wrote a scathing post, telling people that Facebook will stand for more than just the ideas of a few tech elite, but instead for the ideas of the people. Zuckerberg even acknowledged there are GOOD reasons that people support Trump : They believe strongly in smaller government They want a different tax policy They want a better health care system They want to maintain religious freedom They worry about American gun rights Or ANY other issue where he disagrees with Hillary He ended the post by saying: 'That's ultimately what Facebook is about: giving everyone the power to share our experiences, so we can understand each other a bit better and connect us a little closer together.” So, despite the fact that he still supports Hillary Clinton , I want to thank Mark Zuckerberg for having the common decency to acknowledge the Trump Train even though all his tech billionaire friends will attack him for it. Now let's get this shared out everywhere so we can show the world that Hillary's 'network” is finally turning it's back on her. In related news, could what happened just hours after the final debate be the REAL reason Zuckerberg came out of the closet as a pro-Trump keyboard warrior? Several hours after what was arguably Trump 's best performance of the campaign so far, one of the world's top political experts gave Trump the best news he could hope to hear… Danny Gold continues: If you love Trump , today just became a HECK of a lot better! A very well respected political professor from Syracuse has just given Donald Trump the best news of the entire election. Professor Helmut Norpoth stepped forward today, despite HUGE opposition from his peers, to announce that his scientific formula has predicted the TRUE results of the election. And the result is… There is an 87%-99% chance that Donald Trump will WIN the election! Heck yeah! See, at least there are still some people who have not been bought off by Hillary Clinton. According to Northrop, all the other predictions are based entirely on opinion polls, which are inherently wrong. Instead of opinion polling, Norpoth relies on statistics from candidates' performances in party primaries and patterns in the electoral cycle to forecast results. His model has correctly predicted the victor in every presidential election since 1996. (H/T- The Gateway Pundit ) So if you wanted something to celebrate, I mean other than Donald Trump 's epic win over Hillary Clinton at the final Presidential debate, then Helmut Norpoth has just given you exactly that. Now let's help share this GREAT news to everyone else in the entire world. Let every Trump supporting Facebook friend you have know! First of all, Zuckerberg may be a flaming liberal, but he's no fool. It's no secret that Zuckerberg has enjoyed a cushy relationship with Obama and the White House over the past eight years, but a Trump presidency could pose a threat to Mark Zuckerberg's current role as the self-proclaimed arbiter of 'free speech.” As Facebook's CEO, Zuckerberg has almost absolute control over what is, and what is not 'acceptable” to believe in, or talk about on the Internet. Then, there's the whole issue of who Zuckerberg was defending when he had his micro-aggression and temporarily boarded the ' Trump Train.” It's not like he was defending Mother Teresa's good name or something. Peter Thiel, the guy who is Zuck's BFF that people were ragging on for donating to Trump , just happens to the chief henchman of the Bilderberg Group, and chairman of its steering committee. It's worth noting too, that Peter Thiel is HARDLY Zuckerberg's closest connection to the Bilderberg group. I won't discuss it here, but he's got another connection that hits MUCH closer to home, so before everyone gets all excited thinking that perhaps Zuckerberg isn't such a bad guy after all, it's more likely he's just hedging his bets, and Hillary was probably fully aware of what he said ahead of time.

Date: October 28, 2016 in: Global Bankster Takeover , Globalism , Government Control , New World Order , Sleuth Journal , Society , Special Interests , World News When people unfamiliar with the liberty movement stumble onto the undeniable fact of the 'conspiracy” of globalism they tend to look for easy answers to understand what it is and why it exists. Most people today have been conditioned to perceive events from a misinterpreted standpoint of 'Occam's Razor” — they wrongly assume that the simplest explanation is probably the right one. In fact, this is not what Occam's Razor states. Instead, to summarize, it states that the simplest explanation GIVEN THE EVIDENCE at hand is probably the right explanation. It has been well known and documented for decades that the push for globalism is a deliberate and focused effort on the part of a select 'elite;” international financiers, central bankers, political leaders and the numerous members of exclusive think tanks. They often openly admit their goals for total globalization in their own publications, perhaps believing that the uneducated commoners would never read them anyway. Carroll Quigley, mentor to Bill Clinton and member of the Council on Foreign Relations, is often quoted with open admissions to the general scheme: 'The powers of financial capitalism had (a) far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences. The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland; a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank… sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world.” – Carroll Quigley, Tragedy And Hope The people behind the effort to enforce globalism are tied together by a particular ideology, perhaps even a cult-like religion, in which they envision a world order as described in Plato's Republic. They believe that they are 'chosen” either by fate, destiny or genetics to rule as philosopher kings over the rest of us. They believe that they are the wisest and most capable that humanity has to offer, and that through evolutionary means, they can create chaos and order out of thin air and mold society at will. This mentality is evident in the systems that they build and exploit. For example, central banking in general is nothing more than a mechanism for driving nations into debt, currency devaluation, and ultimately, enslavement through widespread economic extortion. The end game for central banks is, I believe, the triggering of historic financial crisis, which can then be used by the elites as leverage to promote complete global centralization as the only viable solution. This process of destabilizing economies and societies is not directed by the heads of the various central banks. Instead, it is directed by even more central global institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements, as outlined in revealing mainstream articles like Ruling The World Of Money published by Harpers Magazine. We also find through the words of globalists that the campaign for a 'new world order” is not meant to be voluntary. '… When the struggle seems to be drifting definitely towards a world social democracy, there may still be very great delays and disappointments before it becomes an efficient and beneficent world system. Countless people … will hate the new world order … and will die protesting against it. When we attempt to evaluate its promise, we have to bear in mind the distress of a generation or so of malcontents, many of them quite gallant and graceful-looking people.” – HG Welles, Fabian Socialist and author of The New World Order 'In short, the 'house of world order' will have to be built from the bottom up rather than f rom the top down. It will look like a great 'booming, buzzing confusion,' to use William James' famous description of reality, but an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault.” – Richard Gardner, member of the Trilateral Commission, published in the April, 1974 issue of Foreign Affairs 'The New World Order cannot happen without U.S. participation, as we are the single most significant component. Yes, there will be a New World Order, and it will force the United States to change its perceptions.” – Henry Kissinger, World Action Council, April 19, 1994 I could quote globalists all day long, but I think you get the general idea. While some people see globalism as a 'natural offshoot” of free markets or the inevitable outcome of economic progress, the reality is that the simplest explanation (given the evidence at hand) is that globalism is an outright war waged against the ideal of sovereign peoples and nations. It is a guerrilla war, or fourth generation warfare, waged by a small group of elites against the rest of us. A significant element of this war concerns the nature of borders. Borders of nations, states and even towns and villages, are not just lines on a map or invisible barriers in the dirt. This is what the elites and the mainstream media would like us to believe. Instead, borders when applied correctly represent principles; or at least, that is supposed to be their function. Human beings are natural community builders; we are constantly seeking out others of like-mind and like-purpose because we understand subconsciously that groups of individuals working together can (often but not always) accomplish more. That said, human beings also have a natural tendency to value individual freedom and the right to voluntary association. We do not like to be forced to associate with people or groups that do not hold similar values. Cultures erect borders because, frankly, people have the right to vet those who wish to join and participate in their endeavors. People also have a right to discriminate against anyone who does not share their core values; or, in other words, we have the right to refuse association with other groups and ideologies that are destructive to our own. Interestingly, globalists and their mouthpieces will argue that by refusing to associate with those who might undermine our values, it is WE who are violating THEIR rights. See how that works? Globalists exploit the word 'isolationism” to shame sovereignty champions in the eyes of the public, but there is no shame in isolation when such principles as freedom of speech and expression or the right to self defense are on the line. There is also nothing wrong with isolating a prosperous economic model from unsuccessful economic models. Forcing a decentralized free market economy to adopt feudal administration through central banking and government will eventually destroy that model. Forcing a free market economy into fiscal interdependencey with socialist economies will also most likely undermine that culture. Just as importing millions of people with differing values to feed on a nation after it has had socialism thrust upon it is a recipe for collapse. The point is, some values and social structures are mutually exclusive; no matter how hard you try, certain cultures can never be homogenized with other cultures. You can only eliminate one culture to make room for the other in a border-less world. This is what globalists seek to achieve. It is the greater purpose behind open border policies and globalization – to annihilate ideological competition so that humanity thinks it has no other option but the elitist religion. The ultimate end game of globalists is not to control governments (governments are nothing more than a tool). Rather, their end game is to obtain total psychological influence and eventually consent from the masses. Variety and choice have to be removed from our environment in order for globalism to work, which is a nice way to say that many people will have to die and many principles will have to be erased from the public consciousness. The elites assert that their concept of a single world culture is the pinnacle principle of mankind, and that there is no longer any need for borders because no other principle is superior to theirs. As long as borders as a concept continue to exist there is always the chance of separate and different ideals rising to compete with the globalist philosophy. This is unacceptable to the elites. This has led not so subtle propaganda meme that cultures that value sovereignty over globalism are somehow seething cauldrons of potential evil. Today, with the rising tide of anti-globalist movements, the argument in the mainstream is that 'populists” (conservatives) are of a lower and uneducated class and are a dangerous element set to topple the 'peace and prosperity” afforded by globalist hands. In other words, we are treated like children scrawling with our finger paints across a finely crafted Mona Lisa. Once again, Carroll Quigley promotes (or predicts) this propaganda decades in advance when he discusses the need for 'working within the system” for change instead of fighting against it: 'For example, I've talked about the lower middle class as the backbone of fascism in the future. I think this may happen. The party members of the Nazi Party in Germany were consistently lower middle class. I think that the right-wing movements in this country are pretty generally in this group.” – Carroll Quigley, from Dissent: Do We Need It? The problem is that these people refuse to confront the fruits of globalization that can be observed so far. Globalists have had free reign over most of the world's governments for at least a century, if not longer. As a consequence of their influences, we have had two World Wars, the Great Depression, the Great Recession which is still ongoing, too many regional conflicts and genocides to count and the systematic oppression of free agent entrepreneurs, inventors and ideas to the point that we are now suffering from social and financial stagnation. The globalists have long been in power, yet, the existence of borders is blamed for the storm of crises we have endured for the past hundred years? Liberty champions are called 'deplorable” populists and fascists while globalists dodge blame like slimy slithering eels? This is the best card the globalists have up their sleeve, and it is the reason why I continue to argue that they plan to allow conservative movements to gain a measure of political power in the next year, only to pull the plug on international fiscal life support and blame us for the resulting tragedy. There is no modicum of evidence to support the notion that globalization, interdependencey and centralization actually work. One need only examine the economic and immigration nightmare present in the EU to understand this. So, the globalists will now argue that the world is actually not centralized ENOUGH. That's right; they will claim we need more globalization, not less, to solve the world's ailments. In the meantime, principles of sovereignty have to be historically demonized — the concept of separate cultures built on separate beliefs has to be psychologically equated with evil by future generations. Otherwise, the globalists will never be able to successfully establish a global system without borders. Imagine, for a moment, an era not far away in which the principle of sovereignty is considered so abhorrent, so racist, so violent and poisonous that any individual would be shamed or even punished by the collective for entertaining the notion. Imagine a world in which sovereignty and conservatism are held up to the next generation as the new 'original sins;” dangerous ideas that almost brought about the extinction of man. This mental prison is where globalists want to take us. We can break free, but this would require a complete reversal of the way in which we participate in society. Meaning, we need a rebellion of voluntary associations. A push for decentralization instead of globalization. Thousands upon thousands of voluntary groups focusing on localization, self reliance and true production. We must act to build a system that is based on redundancy instead of fragile interdependencey. We need to go back to an age of many borders, not less borders, until every individual is himself free to participate in whatever social group or endeavor he believes is best for him, as well as free to defend against people that seek to sabotage him; a voluntary tribal society devoid of forced associations. Of course, this effort would require unimaginable sacrifice and a fight that would probably last a generation. To suggest otherwise would be a lie. I can't possibly convince anyone that a potential future based on a hypothetical model is worth that sacrifice. I have no idea whether it is or is not. I can only point out that the globalist dominated world we live in today is clearly doomed. We can argue about what comes next after we have removed our heads from the guillotine.

in: Mainstream Media , Politics , Propaganda Last week, I reported that the MSM was doing a great deal to try and undermine the truths that are being revealed about our government, the rigged election , and their darling, Hillary Clinton. My suspicion was that they were going so far as to set up fake websites and use skewed polls to prepare us for a Clinton victory. It appears I was not alone in that suspicion because all sorts of people began to bring up the topic of skewed polls, including the Trump campaign. Today, I noticed in the headlines that all of the ' official polls ” are telling a different story. They're telling a story of a battle that is too close to call. Some are even saying that Trump is ahead by a point or two. Some are saying Clinton is a little bit ahead. It's because they've been busted and they're scrambling to cover the evidence of their dishonesty, of course. Politico even wrote a scathing article about the conspiratorial nature of the very idea of rigged elections . How did this happen? I believe that the combined voices of people who are sick of their baloney have made a difference. They realized that they weren't pulling the wool over everyone's eyes and they regrouped. Don't let this convince you that the election is somehow magically 'unrigged.” They're just dialing back the rhetoric because it was so blatant that everyone was noticing it. It's still a disgusting mess but the truth is our defense. Who can you trust? Here are at least two organizations who have a strong record for telling the truth: Project Veritas (It's hard to doubt your own eyes on secret videos – find them on YouTube and Twitter ) Wikileaks (In 10 years their documents have never once been discredited – find them on Twitter and on their website ) Alternative media sites that have been around for a few years are likely to be more trustworthy than the mainstream sites, but let's be honest. We have a bias too – nearly all of us despise Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation, and the Clinton Money Machine that has so overloaded the system with corruption that it's becoming obvious to even the most oblivious Kool-Aid drinker that something is awry. Check the sources. The bottom line is, don't just blindly trust anyone. Vet your sources. Click the links the websites provide and decide whether or not the sources they're quoting seem to be legitimate. When you see the exact same wording repeated over and over, generally it's because it's a talking point that someone has informed the media they are to emphasize. Have you ever noticed phrases like 'an abundance of caution” or 'for your own safety” getting used over and over? It's a talking point and the collusive media is using it as a propaganda tool. Never trust a talking point. We're all being played. I believe that the decision of who will be the next president has already been made. It would take a scandal of massive proportion to derail this train before it gets to the station on November 8th. And that's really saying something, considering the scandals that have already been unearthed, many of which should have landed Clinton in an orange jumpsuit but have somehow been glossed over with little mention in the MSM. If you're as worried about a Clinton presidency as I am, the biggest thing that you can do is fight for the truth to be known. Share reliable information about Hillary Clinton where everyone can learn about it. When we all raise our voices together, we are heard. Telling the truth – and doing so loudly – has never been more important than it is right now. Article first posted at DaisyLuther.com Submit your review

in: Special Interests , US News (image credit: Getty) After announcing her presidential bid last year, Hillary tried getting Moroccan King Mohammed VI to donate $12 million to the Clinton Foundation in return for a face-to-face meeting and speaking engagement. Nice work if you can get it. Easy if you're Bill or Hillary Clinton, money from Morocco's king one of many examples of their corrupt practices. Reporting on email content revealed by WikiLeaks, Fox News Ed Henry, said the following: 'Just hours after Hillary Clinton dodged a question at the final presidential debate about charges of 'pay to play' at the Clinton Foundation, a new batch of WikiLeaks emails surfaced with stunning charges that the candidate herself was at the center of negotiating a $12 million commitment from King Mohammed VI of Morocco.” In an email to Hillary's campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook, close Hillary aide Huma Abedin said 'this was HRC's idea.” 'She created this mess and she knows it” – referring to scheduling a pay-to-play deal one month after launching her presidential bid, certain to raise red flags if revealed. Her advisors were concerned. Abedin emailed '(j)ust to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting (of the Clinton Global Initiative) was her participation. If hrc was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter.” 'This was HRC's idea. Our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting.” A compromise was reached. Bill and Chelsea participated, representing Hillary. Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace pressed Robby Mook for an explanation. Wallace: 'Why wasn't that classic pay-to-play,” he asked? Mook: 'There's nothing new here” – only in terms of it being commonplace Bill and Hillary practice. Wallace: 'But, Robby, there is some new stuff. Emails show, and I'm going to go through some of them, you were not happy at all (about) the idea of this meeting and her going there.” Mook: Calling it a scheduling issue, he claimed '(w)e didn't want her going overseas…before the campaign was kicking off.” Journalist Bob Woodward called Clinton Foundation practices 'corrupt…a scandal. The mixing of speech fees, the Clinton Foundation, and actions by the State Department which she ran are all intertwined…You can't just say it's unsavory.” It's the kind of stuff landing ordinary people in prison. Bill and Hillary remain unaccountable for years of illegal practices. Instead of long overdue prosecution, they're returning to the White House in January for a third co-presidential term as things now stand – apparently rigged to assure it. Submit your review

By: The Voice of Reason | Regardless of how much information gets released through Wikileaks or Project Veritas revealing grossly immoral, or even criminal conduct between members of the Clinton campaign, neither the mainstream media nor our woefully corrupt Department of Injustice have done anything to even slow the Clinton Crime Syndicate's march toward the oval office. With each passing day that brings us closer to the election, lies continue to be pumped out with impunity to the voting public at large by the very institutions the public should be able to trust to give them fair and honest reporting or education on important matters. In the following interview, legendary investor Jim Rogers, explains in detail why nothing being reported about the economy is true, and why financial and economic collapse is imminent. Who is Jim Rogers? Why should you care what he says? First of all, listen to him because he's right. Start learning facts, and stop listening to mainstream media propaganda. They are lying. Your life may depend on being prepared. Second, Jim is hardly alone in his line of thinking. Many of the world's best economists are saying a global reset is coming that will have an effect on the world like nothing mankind has ever seen before. One famous investor even goes as far as to say the collapse of the U.S. Dollar, and the global reset that follows it, will be the single biggest event in all of human history. Let that sink in… Third, and lastly, you should care what Jim Rogers says because Jim is a legendary investor, one who co-founded the Quantum Fund, and retired at age thirty-seven. Do you know who his partner used to be? George Soros. Do you recall who is involved in virtually every major geopolitical firestorm anywhere on the planet, including the U.S. presidential election right here domestically? Many Trump enthusiasts incorrectly believe Donald Trump can save the U.S. from financial implosion, but in his interview, Jim Rogers explains why it doesn't matter who wins the election, the problems that plague the U.S. economy are as systemic as the corruption is in Washington. There is no question Donald Trump has created a massive wave of anti-establishment fervor across the country, and there's equally no question a Trump presidency would soften the blow of a financial collapse, but as Michael Synder explains in the article that follows the Rogers interview, the electoral college math just doesn't add up to a Trump Win. At this point if Donald Trump is able to overcome the amount of fraud baked into the system by the Clinton campaign, and an electoral map that doesn't give him a millimeter of wiggle room, it will truly be a miracle of Biblical proportions. In the meantime, Americans had better begin to prepare for the future that awaits them, with or without a President Trump ! Michael Snyder writes: Are we about to see the largest election day miracle of all time? Because as I will show in this article, that is precisely what it is going to take in order for Donald Trump to win. Before I go any further, I want to make it exceedingly clear that I am not saying what the outcome will be on November 8th. As I recently told a national television audience, I do not know who is going to win. In this article I am simply going to examine the poll numbers and the electoral map as they currently stand. But in this bizarre election things can literally change overnight, and it is entirely possible that we could still have another 'October surprise” or two before it is all said and done. And without a doubt Donald Trump desperately needs something 'to move the needle”, because if the election was held today Hillary Clinton would almost certainly win. What we have witnessed so far during the 2016 election season has been absolutely unprecedented. Just consider some of the things that we have seen up to this point in time. We have never had a bigger 'October surprise” than the release of the lewd audio tape from 11 years ago in which Donald Trump claimed to grope women without their consent. We have never seen the mainstream media openly attack a presidential candidate as much as they have attacked Donald Trump . In the past, the big mainstream news outlets at least pretended to be fair and balanced, but this year they have completely discarded all notions of objectivity. They should be completely and utterly ashamed of themselves, and no matter who wins the election they will never be able to get their integrity back. We have also never seen a major party at war with itself this close to a presidential election. It has been said that a house divided against itself will surely fall, and a whole host of prominent Republican leaders have been openly attempting to sabotage the Trump campaign. If Donald Trump is able to overcome all of these factors, it truly will be a miracle of Biblical proportions. As it stands at the moment, however, the numbers are looking quite ominous for Trump . Right now, the Real Clear Politics average of national polls has Hillary Clinton ahead by 6.2 percent. Most political experts consider that to be an insurmountable lead at this stage in the game. But even if Trump can close that gap and pull ahead, that does not mean that he will win the election. In fact, Trump could beat Clinton by millions of votes nationally and still lose. In order to win the election, one candidate has got to get to 270 electoral votes. And on the latest Real Clear Politics electoral map , 262 electoral votes are being projected to go to Hillary Clinton, 164 electoral votes are being projected to go to Donald Trump , and 112 electoral votes are in the 'toss up” category. So unless something dramatically changes, Donald Trump is essentially going to have to run the table in all of the closely contested states in order to win, and the mathematical odds of that happening are extremely slim. Let's take a closer look at this. The first thing that Donald Trump is going to have to do in order to get to 270 electoral votes is to win all of the states that Mitt Romney won in 2012. That would get him up to 206 electoral votes. Unfortunately, it looks like that may be very difficult to do. Romney won North Carolina, but the six most recent polls all have Clinton ahead in that state. Romney also won Arizona, but the most recent poll to be taken there has Clinton ahead by five points. But for a moment, let's assume that Trump can win all of the states that Romney won. On top of that, there are four other states that Trump must win… #1 Trump must win Florida's 29 electoral votes. Without Florida, Trump has no realistic path to 270 electoral votes. So on election night if it is announced that Trump has lost Florida, you might as well turn off your television and go to bed because Trump is going to lose the election. Unfortunately for Trump , four recent major surveys all show Trump down by four points in the Sunshine state. #2 Trump must win Ohio's 18 electoral votes. No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio, and the two most recent major surveys show that Trump and Clinton are tied in the state. #3 Trump must win Iowa's 6 electoral votes. Fortunately for Trump , most recent surveys show him actually leading in Iowa. #4 Trump must win Nevada's 6 electoral votes. At this point that is looking like it will be very tough to do, because all of the recent polls have Clinton leading in Nevada, including the most recent one that has her up by 7 points. If Donald Trump can win those four states, that still does not get him to 270 electoral votes. Instead, it gets him to 265 electoral votes, and so he would still need one more medium-sized state to win. The most likely candidates for that last state are Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin or Minnesota. Unfortunately for Trump , Clinton appears to have big leads in all four of those states right at this moment. But even if Trump can somehow pull off a miracle and squeak past the 270 electoral vote mark, the truth is that Utah could still mess everything up. Do you remember Evan McMullin? He was the third party 'conservative alternative” candidate that was hyped for a couple of days but that seemingly fell off the map afterwards. He is only on the ballot in 12 states, but one of those states is Utah, and it turns out that Evan McMullin is a Mormon. Many Mormons believe that a Mormon will be elected president someday when the U.S. Constitution hangs ' like a thread '. According to this belief, this Mormon president will turn the country around and all sorts of wonderful things will start to happen. Many Mormons thought that Mitt Romney was going to be this president, but now Evan McMullin has become the target of these expectations. So how in the world could Evan McMullin become president? Well, their plan is to have Evan McMullin win Utah, and that could potentially keep both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton from both getting to 270 electoral votes if the election is super close. If that happens, the election would be thrown into the House of Representatives. It is being projected that the House will still be controlled by the Republicans after this election, and so the choice would come down to either Trump or McMullin, and those backing McMullin believe that he would have a realistic shot in that scenario. I know all of this sounds very strange, but this is actually being discussed around family dinner tables all over Utah tonight. And in recent days Evan McMullin has been soaring in Utah. One recent survey shows Trump with a one point lead over McMullin, and another recent survey actually show McMullin leading Trump by four points in the state. So Trump could pull off a miracle and do everything else that he needs to do to get to 270 electoral votes, and Utah could end up messing up everything for him. In addition, it is also very important to keep in mind that Trump could actually get all of the legitimate votes that he needs to win and still have it stolen from him by election fraud . There was widespread evidence of 'funny business” in 2012, and this is something that I detailed for a live studio audience down at Morningside earlier this month … Are you starting to see why I would consider this to be the biggest miracle in American political history if Donald Trump actually overcomes all of these factors and wins the election? And we don't have to wait until November 8th to get some indications about how the vote is going to go. Early voting is already taking place is some states, and so far the signs are not encouraging for the Trump campaign. The following comes from CNN … Democratic early turnout has stayed steady in North Carolina compared to 2012, while Republicans have dropped by about 14,500. In Nevada, Democrats have a smaller early voting deficit today than they did at this point in 2012. And Democrats are slightly ahead in Arizona in the early vote so far, though they are lagging Republicans in the tally of how many Arizonans have requested ballots. Perhaps most surprisingly, Democrats improved their position in conservative and Mormon-heavy Utah, where recent polls have shown a tight race. At this point in 2012, Republicans led Democrats in early voting by more than 22,000 voters. But so far this year, the GOP advantage is only 3,509. But if you do want Trump to win, the good news is that we still have more than two weeks before November 8th. We have seen some extremely bizarre things happen already in this election, and a miracle is definitely not out of the question. In fact, I am of the opinion that it is quite likely that some very strange events could take place between now and early November. So hold on to your hats, because the most interesting portion of the 2016 election may still be ahead of us.

(image credit: AP/Charlie Neibergall) Dallas elections officials say allegations 'likely false or instances of user error” Over the past few weeks corporate news media have interpreted Donald Trump's repeated claims of a 'rigged” election as exaggerated. The Republican presidential candidate's response in the third presidential debate of perhaps not accepting the election result was met with similar bluster by the major punditocracy. The experience of voters in Texas and other states may be bearing out Trump's warning as multiple reports are surfacing of electronic voting machines changing virtual ballots from Republican to Democratic presidential candidates. Because Texas law prohibits videos and photos in polling places many voters in that state explain the apparent polling shenanigans on social media. As The Economic Collapse Blog observes , [A] number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote. Here are several social media posts from the Dallas Morning New s article at the I Am A Texan blog . The Dallas Morning News similarly reports : Early voters in Texas have claimed that voting machines in Dallas, Collin, Tarrant and other counties changed their presidential votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The allegations follow a similar pattern: Voters say they voted straight-ticket Republican, but when they reviewed their ballots, they reflected they had voted for Hillary Clinton for president, not Donald Trump. Their votes for Republicans in down-ballot races were not affected, according to the complaints. But elections officials say the allegations are more than likely false or instances of user error. Garland City Council member Stephen Stanley said he went to an early voting station at Nicholson Memorial South Branch Library on Tuesday morning while campaigning for candidates on the ballot. He said around noon a woman came out of the library and told him she had tried to vote straight ticket Republican but the machine said she had voted straight Democrat. The woman told him a poll worker apologized that the machine wasn't working and instructed her to use another one. Stanley said he was worried about people who didn't double-check their ballots. 'My question is how many other people didn't know,” Stanley said. Dallas County elections administrator Toni Pippins-Poole encouraged all voters to double-check their ballots before submitting them. She said she's received second-hand reports of malfunctioning machines, but no one has logged an official complaint and she doesn't have any names to go with the claims. H/t Matrix Bob

in: Conspiracy Corner , Government , Government Corruption , Multimedia , Sleuth Journal , Society , Special Interests I n ancient Greece, the proclaimed origin of 'Democracy”, they had an incredible way of selecting public officials to serve in the government, and it was not by popular election. As admitted recently in a 'tell-all” book written by a United States congressman, the vast majority of his time, an estimated 75% or more , is spent on raising money and votes for re -election. Subsequently, this only leaves a few scraps of time leftover for actually doing the job he was hired to do . Additionally, and even more importantly than wasting precious limited work time, in the process of campaigning and fundraising for his prized position, political favors and promises are made which compromise the integrity of his pledge to represent the 'people”, rather than the rich and highly influential corporations, the latter of whom are the only ones with enough wealth capable of helping a congressman, senator, or president, get elected in the first place, and to whom they are now indebted to favor above the people when it comes to ' serving ” them, through enacting laws which end up favoring the rich few , rather than the meager majority , thusly turning this alleged 'democracy” into an undeniable 'oligarchy”, the exact opposite thereof. How did our 'Democracy” get turned Upside-down? The wise old Greeks had a very simple solution to make sure that 'public officials” had no political favors to return for getting into their prized positions. Can you guess what it was . . . ? There were no elections ! You might ask then, how were their representatives chosen ? By Lottery. The same way a jury is still selected to this very day. Surely, if it is fair for twelve citizens, chosen at random , to have power of life or death over a fellow countryman, and this is the very same methodology which the founders of 'Democracy” used in selecting their 'representatives” to best assure that there was no corruption , then this exact same technique can be used Today to assure that the governmental system is clean and free of 'favor-returning” for attaining these highly coveted government positions. A few simple rules could be set in place for eligibility for the lottery, such as an age minimum of twenty-five years, the necessity of being born in the territory of the United States, and no felony convictions in the last seven years. All citizens who meet these modest requirements would be automatically put into the lottery for congress, and if they are chosen, have the right to decline. From among the group of four hundred thirty-five representatives chosen at random, just as a jury is today, to represent the citizens of our nation, these lottery selectees would then nominate from among themselves, by popular vote within this group, three persons for the office of President. Once these three candidates were chosen, and after a public debate process, there would be a national general election by the citizens of America, choosing the President from among these three candidates by the majority of popular national vote, with the Vice Presidency going to the second place winner. Each candidate would be given equal funds from the public treasury with which to campaign, such as fifty million dollars, and television stations, plus newspapers, would be required to freely give each candidate equal time and space in the election process with which to express their positions. A federal law could then be enacted to require that all positions of government, federal, state, county, and city, mayoral and governorship, be required to select themselves, by this same tried and true, and very fair method, of lottery . There could plainly be no purer or simpler way to assure that the 'people” were actually being represented by the people than to choose such persons by lottery from among the People . There could also be a federal law enacted to set a term limit of ONE (five year) TERM , for any and all public offices. Thusly, a person could be sheriff once, major once, president once, with no need to repay favors for their election or re-election, as they were chosen at random, just like a jury, and would now be free to follow their conscious , rather than reimbursing favors to the influential rich minority who got them elected, in a system that is supposed to represent the common majority instead.

in: Government , Government Corruption , Obama Exposed , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests , Whistle Blowers Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton are the founders of ISIS. We have proven that through emails and documents leaked from WikiLeaks, but liberal media outlets still refuse to cover it. After all, they are still more focused on what Trump said eleven years ago than what Hillary has actually done. Because of brave patriots like Julian Assange, we have been given more evidence that Hillary Clinton is more connected to ISIS than we originally believed. An email was leaked between Clinton and John Podesta indicating that: 'Western intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region” to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of 'providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.” Citing the need to 'use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets,” said Hillary to Podesta while arguing the current developments in the Middle East were 'important to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country.” Odd that Clinton argues Saudi Arabia and Qatar are helping fund ISIS when Hillary's largest donations come from those two countries. She Is Funded By Nations That Fund ISIS. Coincidence? In another correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai , set up a meeting with Bill Clinton for five minutes in exchange for a $1,000,000 'birthday check.” The email adds that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would 'welcome [the Clinton Foundation's] suggestions for investments in Haiti — particularly on education and health.” Desai added that while Qatar had already 'allocated most of their $20 million … [they were] happy to consider projects we suggest.” We now see two more examples of the Clinton's acting corrupt and being intertwined with nations that fund ISIS. For those that do not see where the dots connect, let's simplify how this all worked for Hillary. Hillary, as Secretary of State, would sell terrorist nations large weapons deals only after they gave her a very generous donation to her 'foundation.” These weapons, provided by Hillary and her State Department, then filtered down from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Libya, and so on to create, supply, and bolster terrorist groups. That is exactly how ISIS was created. But instead of blowing them up with an air assault, Hillary and Obama decided to leave ISIS alone. Why? Because ISIS being in the Middle East allows the Obama/Clinton machine to make millions in personal profits from these nations in a repetitive cycle of selling weapons. They are choosing personal gain over eliminating a terrorist group. Let that sink in. Why else have they not arrested Hillary for all of these crimes? The FBI would arrest you in a heartbeat if you went to Facebook right now to praise Allah and ISIS. It also speaks volumes as to why they are trying so hard to silence Julian Assange.

in: War Propaganda , World News (image credit: ALEXEY DRUZHININ / RIA NOVOSTI / Kremlin pool / AFP) In September 2015, at the behest of its legitimate government, Russia began aerial operations to combat ISIS and al-Nusra terrorists in Syria. Numerous other likeminded groups are involved, just as cutthroat, just as ruthless, just as extremist, masquerading as 'moderate rebels” when none exist – supported by Washington, NATO , Saudi Arabia, Qatar, other Gulf States, Jordan, Israel and Turkey. They're massacring civilians, killing government soldiers defending them, using chemical and other banned weapons, committing gruesome atrocities. Why does it pretend 'moderate” fighters are involved when none exist? Why does it insist on separating nonexistent 'moderates” from terrorist groups it's combating when all anti-government forces are the same? Why isn't it targeting all armed groups wanting Assad toppled and Syrian sovereign independence destroyed? It's the only way to free the country from the scourge its facing – supported by Washington and its rogue allies, NATO and regional ones. Why did it halt its aerial operations to liberate eastern Aleppo, declaring a unilateral ceasefire, a so-called humanitarian pause – a major blunder, accomplishing nothing? Ongoing since October 18, it's letting US-supported terrorists infesting the city replenish their ranks, regroup and mobilize for heavy attacks, largely harming civilians Moscow says it wants protected. Last Saturday evening, Russia ended its humanitarian pause because US-supported terrorists in eastern Aleppo prevent civilians from leaving, holding thousands hostage as human shields, including the sick and wounded. Yet it ceased aerial attacks, yielding the advantage to dark forces it's sworn to eliminate. What kind of strategy gives them the upper hand? It gets worse. On October 26, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov issued the following statement: 'The Russian Aerospace Forces and the Syrian Air Force have been sticking to a moratorium on air strikes for the past eight days. They are staying out of a 10-km (six-mile) zone around Aleppo.” 'Six humanitarian corridors, field kitchens and first aid stations are open for civilians leaving eastern Aleppo 24 hours a day.” 'Russia and the Syrian government are ready to resume 'humanitarian pauses' in Aleppo if they receive guarantees from international organizations confirming readiness to evacuate the sick and the wounded as well as civilian population from the rebel-held areas.” Fact: Maintaining an airstrike moratorium aids Washington, its rogue allies and terrorists in eastern Aleppo they support. Fact: What good are humanitarian corridors if eastern Aleppo residents are prevented from using them, risking death or serious injury if they try. Fact: International organizations have no control over terrorists in eastern Aleppo – or anywhere else in the country. So what good are their 'guarantees” if made? Fact: As long as Russia continues making the same mistakes repeatedly, the struggle to liberate Syria will likely go on interminably without resolution – a forever war, while countless thousands more civilians will die, be seriously injured and endure hardships people in Western societies can't imagine, victims of US imperial ruthlessness. A handful of eastern Aleppo civilians alone escaped via a humanitarian corridor. According to one now free, their relatives were seized, imprisoned and tortured. The only way to liberate thousands of others is by relentlessly smashing their terrorist captors, eliminating them – not giving them breathing room to mobilize for greater attacks. Washington is delighted with Moscow's ceasefire and humanitarian pause, serving US imperial interests, State Department spokesman admiral John Kirby saying: 'We welcome the stated intention to extend this pause, and we hope that this extension will be more successful…than it has been thus far” – meaning the longer it continues, the greater the benefit to US-led dark forces, the worse off trapped Syrians in eastern Aleppo will be, the longer the struggle to liberate Syria will go on.

By: Charles Seife, Scientific American | The FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has been arm-twisting journalists into relinquishing their reportorial independence, our investigation reveals. Other institutions are following suit. It was a faustian bargain—and it certainly made editors at National Public Radio squirm. The deal was this: NPR, along with a select group of media outlets, would get a briefing about an upcoming announcement by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration a day before anyone else. But in exchange for the scoop, NPR would have to abandon its reportorial independence. The FDA would dictate whom NPR's reporter could and couldn't interview. 'My editors are uncomfortable with the condition that we cannot seek reaction,” NPR reporter Rob Stein wrote back to the government officials offering the deal. Stein asked for a little bit of leeway to do some independent reporting but was turned down flat. Take the deal or leave it. NPR took the deal. 'I'll be at the briefing,” Stein wrote. Later that day in April 2014, Stein—along with reporters from more than a dozen other top-tier media organizations, including CBS, NBC, CNN, the Washington Post , the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times —showed up at a federal building to get his reward. Every single journalist present had agreed not to ask any questions of sources not approved by the government until given the go-ahead. 'I think embargoes that attempt to control sourcing are dangerous because they limit the role of the reporter whose job it is to do a full look at a subject,” says New York Times former public editor Margaret Sullivan. 'It's really inappropriate for a source to be telling a journalist whom he or she can and can't talk to.” Ivan Oransky, distinguished writer in residence at New York University's Journalism Institute and founder of the Embargo Watch weblog, agrees: 'I think it's deeply wrong.” This kind of deal offered by the FDA—known as a close-hold embargo—is an increasingly important tool used by scientific and government agencies to control the behavior of the science press. Or so it seems. It is impossible to tell for sure because it is happening almost entirely behind the scenes. We only know about the FDA deal because of a wayward sentence inserted by an editor at the New York Times . But for that breach of secrecy, nobody outside the small clique of government officials and trusted reporters would have known that the journalists covering the agency had given up their right to do independent reporting. Documents obtained by Scientific American through Freedom of Information Act requests now paint a disturbing picture of the tactics that are used to control the science press. For example, the FDA assures the public that it is committed to transparency, but the documents show that, privately, the agency denies many reporters access—including ones from major outlets such as Fox News—and even deceives them with half-truths to handicap them in their pursuit of a story. At the same time, the FDA cultivates a coterie of journalists whom it keeps in line with threats. And the agency has made it a practice to demand total control over whom reporters can and can't talk to until after the news has broken, deaf to protests by journalistic associations and media ethicists and in violation of its own written policies. By using close-hold embargoes and other methods, the FDA, like other sources of scientific information, are gaining control of journalists who are supposed to keep an eye on those institutions. The watchdogs are being turned into lapdogs. 'Journalists have ceded the power to the scientific establishment,” says Vincent Kiernan, a science journalist and dean at George Mason University. 'I think it's interesting and somewhat inexplicable, knowing journalists in general as being people who don't like ceding power.” The press corps is primed for manipulation by a convention that goes back decades: the embargo. The embargo is a back-room deal between journalists and the people they cover—their sources. A source grants the journalist access on condition that he or she cannot publish before an agreed-on date and time. A surprisingly large proportion of science and health stories are the product of embargoes. Most of the major science journals offer reporters advance copies of upcoming articles—and the contact information of the authors—in return for agreeing not to run with the story until the embargo expires. These embargoes set the weekly rhythm of science coverage: On Monday afternoon, you may see a bunch of stories about the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA published almost simultaneously. Tuesday, it's the Journal of the American Medical Association . On Wednesday, it's Nature and the New England Journal of Medicine. Science stories appear on Thursday. Other institutions have also adopted the embargo system. Federal institutions, especially the ones science and health journalists report on, have as well. Embargoes are the reason that stories about the National Laboratories, the National Institutes of Health and other organizations often tend to break at the precisely same time. Embargoes were first embraced by science reporters in the 1920s, in part because they take the pressure off. After all, when everybody agrees to publish their stories simultaneously, a reporter can spend extra time researching and writing a story without fear of being scooped. '[Embargoes] were created at the behest of journalists,” says Kiernan, who has written a book, Embargoed Science , about scientific embargoes. 'Scientists had to be convinced to go along.” But scientific institutions soon realized that embargoes could be used to manipulate the timing and, to a lesser extent, the nature of press coverage. The result is a system whereby scientific institutions increasingly control the press corps. 'They've gotten the upper hand in this relationship, and journalists have never taken it back,” Kiernan says. The embargo system is such an established institution in science journalism that few reporters complain or even think about its darker implications, at least until they themselves feel slighted. This January the California Institute of Technology was sitting on a great story: researchers there had evidence of a new giant planet—Planet Nine—in the outer reaches of our solar system. The Caltech press office decided to give only a dozen reporters, including Scientific American 's Michael Lemonick, early access to the scientists and their study. When the news broke, the rest of the scientific journalism community was left scrambling. 'Apart from the chosen 12, those working to news deadlines were denied the opportunity to speak to the researchers, obtain independent viewpoints or have time to properly digest the published research paper,” complained BBC reporter Pallab Ghosh about Caltech's 'inappropriate” favoritism in an open letter to the World Federation of Science Journalists. When asked about why Caltech chose to release the news only to a select group of reporters, Farnaz Khadem, Caltech's head of communications, stated that she is committed to being 'fair and transparent” about how and when Caltech shares news with journalists. She then refused to talk about the Planet Nine incident or embargoes or press strategy, and she would not grant access to anyone at Caltech who might talk about such matters. As a consequence, it is hard to know for certain why Caltech decided to share the news with only a select group of reporters. But it is not hard to guess why journalists such as Ghosh were excluded. 'It wasn't that they were not good enough or not liked enough,” Kiernan speculates. 'There was a real effort here to control things, making sure that the elite of the elite covered this story and covered it in a certain way, which would then shape the coverage of all other journalists. It's very clearly a control effort.” Caltech is not the only institution that steers coverage by briefing a very small subset of reporters. (As I was writing this piece, I received a note from a U.S. Air Force press officer offering a sneak preview of video footage being offered to 'a select number of digital publications.”) For years the FDA has been cultivating a small group of journalists who are entrusted with advance notice of certain events while others are left out in the cold. But it was not the game of favorites that ignited a minor firestorm in the journalism community in January 2011—it was the introduction of the close-hold embargo. Like a regular embargo, a close-hold embargo allows early access to information provided that attendees not publish before a set date and time. In this case, it was a sneak peek at rules about to be published regarding medical devices. But there was an additional condition: reporters were expressly forbidden from seeking outside comment. Journalists would have to give up any semblance of being able to do independent reporting on the matter before the embargo expired. Even reporters who had been dealing with the FDA for years were incredulous. When one asked the agency's press office if it really was forbidding communications with outside sources, Karen Riley, an official at the FDA, erased all doubt. 'It goes without saying that the embargo means YOU CANNOT call around and get comment ahead of the 1 P.M. embargo,” she said in an e-mail. 'Actually it does need some saying, since this is a new version of a journalistic embargo,” wrote Oransky in his Embargo Watch blog. Without the ability to contact independent sources, he continued, 'journalists become stenographers.” Kiernan echoes the sentiment: '[When] you can't verify the information, you can't get comment on the information. You have to just keep it among this group of people that I told you about, and you can't use it elsewhere. In that situation, the journalist is allowing his or her reporting hands to be tied in a way that they're not going to be anything, ultimately, other than a stenographer.” The Association of Health Care Journalists (AHCJ), of which I am a member, publicly objected to the close-hold embargo, noting that it 'will be a serious obstacle to good journalism. Reporters who want to be competitive on a story will essentially have to agree to write only what the FDA wants to tell the world, without analysis or outside commentary.” Faced by this opposition, the agency quickly backtracked. After a meeting with AHCJ leaders, Meghan Scott, then the agency's acting associate commissioner for external affairs, wrote: 'Prior to your inquiry, the FDA did not have a formal news embargo policy in place.” The FDA was now establishing new ground rules that 'will better serve the media and the public.” Initially published online in June 2011, the FDA's new media policy officially killed the close-hold embargo: 'A journalist may share embargoed material provided by the FDA with nonjournalists or third parties to obtain quotes or opinions prior to an embargo lift provided that the reporter secures agreement from the third party to uphold the embargo.” Due diligence would always be allowed, at least at the FDA. Health and science journalists breathed a sigh of relief. The AHCJ expressed gratitude that the FDA had changed its tune, and Oransky's Embargo Watch congratulated the agency for backing down: 'For doing the right thing, the FDA has earned a spot on the Embargo Watch Honor Roll. Kudos.” And the FDA had cleared up the misunderstanding and affirmed that it was committed to 'a culture of openness in its interaction with the news media and the public.” In reality, there was no misunderstanding. The close-hold embargo had become part of the agency's media strategy. It was here to stay—policy or no policy. It is hard to tell when a close-hold embargo is afoot because, by its very nature, it is a secret that neither the reporters who have been given special access nor the scientific institution that sets up the deal wants to be revealed. The public hears about it only when a journalist chooses to reveal the information. We have a few rare instances where journalists revealed that close-hold embargoes were being used by scientists and scientific institutions after 2011. In 2012 biologist Gilles-Eric Séralini and his colleagues published a dubious—later retracted and then republished—paper purportedly linking genetically modified foods to cancer in rats. They gave reporters early access under a close-hold embargo, quite likely to hamstring the reporters' ability to explore gaping holes in the article, a situation science journalist Carl Zimmer described as 'a rancid, corrupt way to report about science.” In 2014 the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (also called the CSB) released a report to journalists under a close-hold embargo. When challenged, the then managing director of the CSB, Daniel Horowitz, told Oransky's Embargo Watch that the close-hold embargo was used 'on the theory that this would provide a more orderly process.” He then stated that the board was going to 'drop the policy in its entirety for future reports.” Privately, however, a CSB public affairs specialist noted in an e-mail, 'Frankly, I wish we did have more stenographers out there. Government agencies trying to control the information flow is an old story, but the other side of the story is that government agencies that do good work often have a difficult time getting their story told in an era of journalistic skepticism and partisan bickering and bureaucratic infighting.” Also in 2014 the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) used a close-hold embargo when it announced to a dozen reporters that researchers had discovered subtle signals of gravitational waves from the early universe. 'You could only talk to other scientists who had seen the papers already; we didn't want them shared unduly,” says Christine Pulliam, the media relations manager for CfA. Unfortunately, the list of approved scientists provided by CfA listed only theoreticians, not experimentalists—and only an experimentalist was likely to see the flaw that doomed the study. (The team was seeing the signature of cosmic dust, not gravitational waves.) 'I felt like a fool, in retrospect,” says Lemonick, who, as one of a dozen or so chosen journalists, covered the story for Time (at the time, he was not on the staff of Scientific American ). The FDA, too, quietly held close-hold embargoed briefings, even though its official media policy forbids it. Without a source willing to talk, it is impossible to tell for sure when or why FDA started violating its own rules. A document from January 2014, however, describes the FDA's strategy for getting media coverage of the launch of a new public health ad campaign. It lays out a plan for the agency to host a 'media briefing for select, top-tier reporters who will have a major influence on coverage and public opinion of the campaigns.… Media who attend the briefing will be instructed that there is a strict, close-hold embargo that does not allow for contact with those outside of the FDA for comment on the campaign.” Why? The document gives a glimpse: 'Media coverage of the campaign is guaranteed; however, we want to ensure outlets provide quality coverage of the launch,” the document explains. 'The media briefing will give us an opportunity to shape the news stories, conduct embargoed interviews with the major outlets ahead of the launch and give media outlets opportunities to prepare more in-depth coverage of the campaign launch.” Ten reporters—from the New York Times , the Washington Post, USA Today , the Associated Press, Reuters, ABC, NBC, CNN and NPR—were invited to have their stories shaped. The day after the briefing, on February 4, everybody—except for the New York Times —ran with stories about the ad campaign. Independent comment was notably missing. Only NPR, which went live hours after the others, and CNN, in an update to its story midday, managed to get any reaction from anyone outside of the FDA. CBS plunked down an out-of-context quotation from the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, probably in hopes that readers wouldn't notice that it was two months old. Nobody else seems to have tried to get anyone who could critique the ad campaign. The result was a set of stories almost uniformly cleaving to the FDA's party line, without a hint of a question about whether the ad campaign would be as ineffective as many other such campaigns. Not one of the media outlets said anything about the close-hold embargo. From the agency's point of view, it was mission accomplished. The FDA had a much harder task two months later. The agency was about to make public controversial new rules about electronic cigarettes. It was nearly impossible to keep the story from leaking out ahead of time; days before the new rules were going to be published in April 2014, rumors were flying. Reporters around the country could smell the story and began to e-mail the FDA's press office with questions about the e-cigarette rules. The agency flacks would have to use all the powers at their disposal to control the flow of information. 'I've heard a number of rumors that the FDA will be releasing its proposed e-cigarette regulations on Monday,” Clara Ritger, then a reporter with the National Journal asked on Friday, April 18. 'I wanted to see if I could confirm that? If that's not accurate, do you have a timeline?” Stephanie Yao, then an FDA press officer, dodged the question: 'The proposal is still in draft form and under review. As a matter of policy, the FDA does not share draft rules with outside groups while a rule is still under review.” The fencing match was on. 'Thank you for following up with the statement,” Ritger responded. 'While I know the proposal is still in draft form and under review, for my planning purposes I wanted to find out when the proposed regulations will be coming out?” 'Have you subscribed to FDA press announcements?” Jenny Haliski, then another FDA press officer, wrote back on Monday. 'The proposed rule itself will be published in the Federal Register.” 'Thanks for sending! I signed up,” Ritger responded. 'The only other question I had was when the proposed regulations would come out, off the record, for planning purposes?” Not even an offer of being off the record could get the agency to spill the beans. 'The FDA can't speculate on the timing of the proposed rule,” Haliski replied. But this was a carefully crafted half-truth. There was no need to speculate. Haliski and others in the press office knew quite well not just that the rule was going to be published on Thursday, April 24, but also that there was going to be a close-hold embargoed briefing on Wednesday. It's just that Ritger and the National Journal weren't invited. The invite list had been drafted days earlier, and, as usual, the briefing was limited to trusted journalists: the same outlets from the ad campaign briefing in February, with the addition of a few more, which included the Wall Street Journal , the Boston Globe , the Los Angeles Times , Bloomberg News, Politico and the Congressional Quarterly . At the very same moment that the agency was discussing the embargoed briefing with some of their chosen reporters, anyone outside that small circle, like Ritger, was being thrown off the trail. Not even Fox News was allowed in. Some within the FDA press office wondered why Fox was excluded, unlike the other major networks. 'BTW, we noticed that Fox still wasn't on the invite list,” Raquel Ortiz, then an FDA press officer, told Haliski. 'I have no national Fox reporter who had contacted me on this topic,” Haliski responded. 'All reporters invited to the briefing needed to have covered tobacco regulatory issues before.” Ortiz realized that this wasn't an honest answer: 'But they definitely cover FDA/CTP [Center for Tobacco Products] and tobacco stories—[a colleague has] seen them.” 'We don't have a good contact for Fox,” Haliski insisted, rather lamely. A contact would not have been hard to find had they bothered to look. And, as chance would have it, the contact found them. Early the next morning, with plenty of time before the briefing, Fox's senior national correspondent—John Roberts, one-time heir apparent to Dan Rather—contacted Haliski asking for access. 'I'm aware that the FDA will likely come out with its deeming rule regarding e-cigarettes in the next week or so. I'd like to have a story ready to go for the day (holding to any embargo),” he wrote. 'Can we make that happen?” 'Hi, John, Have you subscribed to FDA press announcements?” Access denied. 'I was particularly troubled by it because I was the medical correspondent for CBS Evening News for a couple of years, and I had a very good relationship with the FDA and everybody there,” says Roberts, who found out he was excluded after the other correspondents' stories came out. 'I was told by these folks that Fox news wasn't invited because of 'past experiences with Fox.'” A little after noon on Wednesday, April 23, the briefing went on as scheduled. All the reporters present understood the terms, as announced: 'As discussed, under this embargo you will not be able to reach out to third parties for comment on this announcement. We are providing you with a preview of the information with this understanding.” But by 2:30 P.M., the close-hold embargo was already fraying at the edges. FDA officials apparently got wind that a reporter was trying to talk to a member of Congress about the new rules. Even though it was not clear that this was a breach of the embargo—the interview was scheduled for after the embargo expired, and the reporter presumably did not share any crucial information ahead of time—it was bending the close-hold rules, and the FDA was livid. Within half an hour, FDA's Jefferson had fired off an angry e-mail to the close-hold journalists. 'It has been brought to our attention that there has already been a break in the embargo…. Third-party outreach of any kind was and is not permitted for this announcement. Everyone who participated agreed to this,” she wrote. 'Moving forward, we will no longer consider embargoed briefings for news media if reporters are not willing to abide by the terms an embargo…. We take this matter very seriously, and as a consequence any individuals who violated the embargo will be excluded from future embargoed briefings with the agency.” Violate the rules, even in spirit, and you'll be left out in the cold with the rest. The denials flew in. 'This is very frustrating as someone who has consistently played by the rules and has covered CTP/FDA for years to be lumped in with a group of reporters that cannot respect your requests not to reach out to third parties,” insisted then AP reporter Michael Felberbaum. 'I have of course always advocated that you work more closely with reporters like myself who clearly understand and cover this area consistently instead of reporters who are just assigned to handle on a whim.” But despite the scare about a breach, the secrecy held. When the embargo expired and the early news stories went online, the FDA had little to complain about; the embargo had worked once again to shape coverage. Felberbaum's piece, for example, quoted Margaret Hamburg, then head of the FDA, and Mitch Zeller, the head of the agency's CTP, but nobody else. Even after he updated his piece later in the day to get some outside comments, there was little hint of how controversial the new rules were. Members of the tobacco industry were generally unhappy with increased federal regulation of their business, while antitobacco advocates tended to argue that the new regulations were far too weak and took way too long to promulgate. And there was no mention, in Felberbaum's article, at least, that the agency had tried to regulate e-cigarettes several years earlier but was slapped down with a stinging rebuke from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. (When asked about his work for the AP, Felberbaum—who has since quit his job as a reporter to become an FDA press officer—said, 'I'm not really sure whether I'm comfortable discussing that at this point.”) Some of the other outlets, like NPR, injected a little more nuance into their pieces, despite the restrictions, by doing additional reporting after the embargo expired. (In a statement, NPR said that agreeing to the FDA's conditions was not a violation of ethics guidelines and 'in no way influenced which other voices or ideas were included in the coverage.”) Still, even those pieces did not stray far from the key messages that the agency wanted to get across. Again the FDA found little to complain about. Except for one little thing. Of all the media outlets, the New York Times was the only one to mention the close-hold embargo: 'FDA officials gave journalists an outline of the new rules on Wednesday but required that they not talk to industry or public health groups until after Thursday's formal release of the document.” ('I felt like I wanted to be clear with readers,” Sabrina Tavernise, the author of the story, later told Sullivan, the New York Times ' public editor at the time. 'Usually you would have reaction in a story like this, but in this case, there wasn't going to be any.”) The FDA was not pleased that the omertà had been broken. 'I have to say while I generally reserve my editorial comments, I was a little surprised by the tone of your article and the swipe you took at the embargo in the paper—when after combing through the coverage no one else felt the need to do so in quite that way,” the FDA's Jefferson upbraided Tavernise in an e-mail. 'To be clear, this is me taking stuff personally when I know I shouldn't, but I thought we had a better working relationship than this…. I never expect totally positive coverage as our policies are controversial and complex, but at least more neutral and slightly less editorialized. Simply put, bummer. Off to deal with a pissed Fox News reporter.” Tavernise promptly apologized. 'Geez, sorry about the embargo thing. Editors were asking why we didn't get to see it so I was asked to put a line in to explain,” she wrote. (Tavernise declined to comment for this article; Celia Dugger, one of the New York Times editors who handled the piece, said via e-mail: 'As to the decision to describe the conditions of the embargo in the story, Sabrina and I talked it over and agreed it was best to include them.”) The FDA was not pleased that the secret of the close-hold embargo was out, and the excluded press was confused and angry. 'In this particular instance, it struck me as very strange,” says Fox's Roberts. 'It was a government agency picking and choosing who it was going to talk to on a matter of public policy, and then the fact that I had a longstanding relationship with the FDA that, with this new administration, didn't seem to matter.” Oransky complained again on Embargo Watch about the FDA's attempts to turn journalists 'into stenographers.” Sullivan asked a few pointed questions of Jefferson, who, in Sullivan's words, insisted that the FDA's intent was 'not to be manipulative but to give reporters early access to a complicated news development” and noted, in passing, that Tavernise had not objected to the terms of the close-hold embargo. But the damage was short-lived. Very little came of the complaints; Sullivan said that she would 'like to see the Times push back—hard—against such restrictions in every instance and be prepared to walk away from the story if need be,” but there is no evidence of any substantial pushback by anyone. The two-tiered system of outsiders and insiders that undergirds the close-hold policy is also still enforced. Major press outlets such as Scientific American and Agence France-Presse have written to the FDA to complain about being excluded but have not received any satisfaction from the agency. Months after the e-cigarette affair and following a different FDA story about food labeling that insiders had early access to, Time magazine complained about its lack of access to a select-press-only phone call. ' Time was not included … (they weren't even on my radar to be honest with you), but we handled all their queries” the day after the call, then FDA press officer Jennifer Corbett Dooren wrote. Absent any indications from the agency, it is anyone's guess whether the close-hold embargo is still in use at the FDA and, if so, how frequently. Unfortunately, the FDA refused to answer any questions. Because I am suing the agency for access to documents about embargo practices at the FDA, the press office, in a statement that failed to answer any specific questions, said that news embargoes 'allow reporters time to develop their articles on complex matters in an informed, accurate way” and that its use of embargoes conforms to relevant government guidelines and best practices. The press office referred all questions to the FDA's Office of the Chief Counsel, which did not supply answers. Since the New York Times slip, no journalist covering the agency has openly mentioned being subject to such restrictions. Scientific American made a significant effort to contact many of the reporters believed to have agreed to an FDA close-hold embargo—including the AP's Felberbaum, the Times ' Tavernise, NPR's Stein, and other reporters from Reuters, USA Today and the LA Times . None could shed any light on the issue. Some explicitly refused to speak to Scientific American ; some failed to return queries; two had no recollection of having ever agreed to a close-hold embargo, including Tom Burton, a Pulitzer Prize–winning Wall Street Journal reporter and the only one willing to answer questions. 'I didn't remember it at all, and [even] after you told me, I didn't remember,” he said. As far as he knows, Burton added, such embargoes are rare. No matter how rare it might be, there is documentary evidence of its happening multiple times, and each instance since 2011 is a violation of the FDA's official media policy, which explicitly bans close-hold embargoes. This policy still stands, just as it did before the last close-hold embargo. The smart money says that the agency's unofficial policy still stands, too—and the favoritism and close-hold embargoes continue. It is apparently too sweet an arrangement for the FDA simply to walk away. Despite the difficulty of measuring the use of close-hold embargoes, Oransky and Kiernan and other embargo observers agree that they—and other variations of the embargo used to tighten control over the press—appear to be on the rise. And they have been cropping up in other fields of journalism, such as business journalism as well. 'More and more sources, including government sources but also corporate sources, are interested in controlling the message, and this is one of the ways they're trying to do it,” says the New York Times ' Sullivan. 'I think it should be resisted.” As much blame as government and other institutions bear for attempting to control the press through such means, the primary responsibility lies with the journalists themselves. Even a close-hold embargo wouldn't constrain a reporter without the reporter's consent; the reporter can simply wait until the embargo expires and speak to outside sources, albeit at the cost of filing the story a little bit later. Says Oransky: 'We as journalists need to look inward a little bit and think about why all of us feel we absolutely have to publish something at embargo [expiration] when we don't think we have the whole story?” Alas, Kiernan says, there isn't any movement within the journalism community to change things: 'I don't know that journalists in general have taken a step back, [looking] from the 50,000-foot view to understand how their work is controlled and shaped by the embargo system.

in: Mainstream Media , Multimedia , Propaganda , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests , US News 'There is no evidence that anything described on these tapes actually took place”– CNN News Analyst, Gloria Borger Now is the greatest time ever to wake up politically to what is really happening in America and in the world. It's the perfect time to wake up and see the corrupt ruling elite in action and in real-time. Mass deception is at an all-time high. Every day the deceivers speak on TV, boldly telling us more and more lies without shame. Your enslavement is at stake and they are the chosen mouthpieces to make this happen. These master deceivers and sorcerers are the reason humanity is where it is today. They are the reason why the 9/11 criminals got away with it and they are the reason for the post-9/11 march toward the new world order that we are in now. They (the deceptive mainstream media) are the reason for the alternative media and for the truth movement. I'm sure most readers already know this very well. It only follows then that historic revelations and leaks of corruption and lawlessness call for historic lies, deceit and counter propaganda in order to implement some level of damage control. And frankly that is exactly what we are seeing coming from CNN and the rest of the (Hillary supporting liberal left) corporate media in response to the recent Project Veritas Action bombshell revelation of corruption videos produced by James O'Keefe. The video tells a very clear story of corruption going all the way up to the DNC and now Hillary herself. The video conversation cannot expose Hillary and the DNC any more right? We're all thinking, there is no way around these very damning videos right? Actually, there is one thing about the ruling elite and their play-along stooges, there is no situation, no accusation, no video or audio proof, no firsthand testimony, no form of evidence that is too much for them to outright deny, discredit, downplay, ignore or deflect. None whatsoever. So as truth seekers, rather than getting upset with the tactics employed by the criminal elite and their minions, let's admire them and list them for all of us to see. The following are just some of the excuses and tactics being employed by the talking heads; in this case I will only quote two individuals from a recent CNN panel discussing the topic of the new revelations of Clinton, DNC corruption. First there's Gloria Borger- CNN Chief Political Analyst who appears to be the 'expert” propagandist being rolled out in front of the CNN cameras. The other being Van Jones- Clinton supporter and former Obama senior adviser. The quotes from these two individuals are not just a display of propaganda but examples of professional political damage control. That is, lies to keep the masses confused and in the dark to what is really happening: Below are some of Gloria Borger's recent statements followed by my responses. 1- 'We don't know where the video was gotten” Since when does CNN carefully check their sources? Truth seekers that challenge the mainstream media's sources all the time get accused of being 'conspiracy theorists”, of 'harassing” fake victim's families and they get treated like criminals. All that aside, sorry Borger, but the source of the video is not the issue here to begin with. What is seen happening in the video and what is being said in the video is the main issue. We're talking about DNC-Hillary associated criminals talking in front of the camera about things no one is supposed to know about corruption inside the Hillary-DNC team but now they do. 2- 'We don't know how it (the video) was edited” With this statement, senior CNN political analyst Gloria Borger attempts to push the conspiracy (without her actually saying it) that perhaps these videos are a fabrication with carefully constructed fake voice-overs, perhaps photoshopped images and video special effects that make this situation look like it's really happening when it's not. You know. The kind of stuff that THEY (the controllers) would do. Again, the authenticity of the video is not the issue. Remember this is the same CNN that tried to sell us on the laughable Bin Laden death hoax videos of 2011 and the fake ISIS beheadings in 2014. Did CNN question the authenticity of these videos? Now all of sudden all videos are hoaxes until somehow confirmed by CNN to be 'authentic”. This may quietly be the most stunning thing Borger says here. Notice how they are slowly ushering a world where a firsthand video produced by we-the-people or the average person which SHOWS you their corruption is by default not 'authentic” until proven otherwise by them (the mainstream media)! 3- 'There are so many unanswered questions to this story” Really? What unanswered questions? This is Borger's way of suggesting that there is a pile of 'questions” out there that are not being asked that would immediately change the context of the reality of these damning videos. Of course we're never told what are these 'questions”. It's like they are borrowing this term from the truth movement to defend themselves. When critical thinking truth seekers say they (we) have 'questions” our questions are concrete and definitive. Borger thus floats the idea of 'unanswered questions” without the need to be specific knowing that the concept of having 'questions” sounds fundamentally very reasonable. 4- 'You see this story, um, it first appears in Breitbart…” Again, Borger is appealing to the viewers emotions and hearts instead of their critical thinking mind by resorting to the notion that if the story first appeared on a website that our viewers are told not to believe or trust ('one of our enemies”) then the whole story is questionable solely on this premise. These are all tactics from a pro who knows how to twist the narrative to deceive the viewers who follow them. Of course Borger knows she's blowing smoke at her viewers and that attacking the messengers in this case has no merit given the context of these videos but that's all part of the propaganda tactic. 5- 'I think however this is a story that needs a lot more reporting on it” As mentioned earlier, Borger is implying without actually saying it that since CNN or the Hillary-mainstream complex hasn't acknowledged the videos then as a whole we are far from the point of being able to say these videos and thus the evidence in the videos are authentic. Because of this previously suggested delusional lie Borger adds to the point by suggesting that THEREFORE 'a lot more reporting” needs to be done. In other words she's saying- yeah, we've seen the videos but since CNN hasn't approved it yet, who knows how real it actually is ? Now here is a statement made by Van Jones who adds his own layer of super damage control propaganda: 6 – Jones states that because the report comes from James O'Keefe that ALONE (get this) is 'reason to withhold judgment”! Throughout the CNN report O'Keefe is repeatedly referred to as 'discredited” and a 'criminal” by several members of the CNN panel including Democratic strategist Maria Cardona and CNN Senior Investigative Correspondent Drew Griffin who tries to sound official when he announces the DNC official response that: 7 –'There is no evidence that anything described on these tapes actually took place” It's amazing how the professional liars attempt to side-step reality in a generation (today in 2016) where the ruling elite are desperately trying to keep the masses dumbed-down smack in the middle of a historic information age where all corruption is now being fully revealed. How do you side-step reality under these circumstances? Question the authenticity of any evidence that exposes what you are doing. This is apparently the strategy including brushing off the revelations as 'locker room talk” , another new term we can expect to see used much more frequently in the future (including 'bar room talk” etc). The 'locker room talk” tactic allows them to take anything said on camera and insert it into this imaginary box, the 'locker room talk” box. The sheep will accept the new term not even knowing why. Because it's what George Orwell described as newspeak . This was the biggest thing that jumped out at me after watching this CNN segment posted by Project Veritas Action. It doesn't matter how much corruption and evil they (we) expose. We now know exactly how the establishment will respond every time. They will question the authenticity of that new revelation, they will demonize the messenger who exposes them, they will look to press criminal charges if possible on whoever exposes them, and they will present the evidence as 'unproven” until they themselves approve of it. Then they will ratchet up their own counter 'leaks” and allegations (beware, we should be expecting a huge counter propaganda move very soon!!) as a counterattack and to distract the public from the Clinton leaks that are coming out seemingly every day now. This, my friends, is how professional political propaganda works. This is similar to the careful skill and delicacy involved in the 'plausible deniability” tactic described by Scott Foval in the recent videos. It's subtle and it's a skillful way of doing something without showing the strings that connect to the puppet master giving the orders, in this case Hillary and the DNC. What all of this means is that it really is time for everyone to wake up and realize once and for all that the mainstream media is constantly lying to us and we can't expect them to turn on their own kind. We can't expect the mainstream media to take our side and help us expose the corruption when they themselves are a large part of that corruption. It really is time to spread this awareness and to truly prepare for a new paradigm which is already well underway. Let's signal to these liars at CNN that they are exposed and their time is coming. There is too much goodness in humanity for the dark and oppressive mainstream media led machine to continue doing what its doing to humanity. Their lies and deceit must be exposed. Endless wars must stop. The US empire and their global propaganda and information control must be acknowledged for what it is. Thankfully, one of the little things all of us can control which is very effective is our ability to share this information and help spread it across the globe. Let's do that! Submit your review

in: Natural Medicine We all know that it's important to eat our vegetables. At least, that's what most of us have heard since we were kids. What our mother's told us as when we were young, our doctors tell us as we get older. Sometimes though, it helps to have a more specific reason than high cholesterol, or even a motherly 'because I said so.” Especially for people who aren't big fans of eating organic greens. According to a study conducted at Oregon State University's Linus Pauling Micronutrient Research Institute confirms that sulforaphane, a phytochemical found in broccoli and related cruciferous vegetables, such as cauliflower and cabbage , have a natural ability to target and attack prostate cancer cells without harming neighboring cells [ 1 ] . Unconnected studies suggest it may have similar promise for breast cancer. The active chemicals found in everyday foods – such as broccoli – are often much more potent than people would imagine. If fact, determining how to safely adapt these chemical ingredients for medical use is one of the biggest hurdles researchers face. Even edible plants that are considered 'rich” in a given nutritional substance, contain relatively low amounts of it by volume. The vast majority of these compounds may also become toxic to humans if taken in large enough concentrations. While a number of previous investigations have proven that sulforaphane is able to attack both benign and malignant cancer cells, the Oregon State study is one of the first to prove that it is effective without disrupting otherwise healthy tissue. This gives researchers a tremendous tool for developing new, low-risk treatment options, and is likely to encourage additional research into the healing potential of other seemingly mundane edible plants. Realistically, it could be some time before these findings are applied to any sort of drug development or cancer treatment in a traditional hospital setting. Meanwhile though, the researchers behind the study recommend that we all eat more organic cruciferous vegetables. Besides broccoli, a number of readily available cruciferous vegetables contain naturally large amounts of sulforaphane. Some good examples of foods high in this important phytochemical include mild and spicy radishes, turnips, watercress, cabbage, arugula, kale, chard, and most other leafy greens. Unrelated studies also suggest a variety of other cancer-fighting compounds may be present in other herbs and garden vegetables. Celery and parsley , for instance, are especially rich in apigenin – a substance that has shown remarkable promise for fighting breast cancer. Trace amounts of apigenin are also found in oranges, apples, and some tree nuts. The problem is, it's very difficult for the body to effectively extract it from any of these foods on its own.

in: Faith , US News On October 31st, most people will simply ignore the dark side of Halloween. The vast majority of the population will dress up in costumes, go to parties and eat candy without ever even considering where the holiday came from or what certain people are doing behind closed doors. But the truth is that Halloween night is one of the biggest nights of the year for witches, occultists and Satanists. All over America, those that are deep into the dark arts will be contacting the dead, casting spells and conducting blood sacrifices. As you will see below, there is a reason why animal shelters across the country ban the adoption of black cats this time of the year. But even our 'innocent” Halloween traditions such as dressing up in costumes, 'trick or treating” and carving jack-o'-lanterns all have their roots in ancient pagan practices . And every year the costumes for our young girls become even more sexually suggestive, the horror movies become even more demonic, and the public's fascination with the occult just continues to grow. It truly is a festival of death, but most people don't seem to care. In fact, experts are telling us that Halloween has now become America's second biggest holiday. According to the National Retail Federation , nearly 70 percent of all Americans plan to celebrate Halloween this year, and spending is expected to shatter the all-time record… According to the National Retail Federation's annual survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics, total spending for Halloween is expected to reach $8.4 billion, an all-time high in the survey's 11-year history. U.S. consumers are expected to spend an average of $82.93, up from last year's $74.34, with more than 171 million Americans planning to partake in Halloween festivities this year. To give you some context, total Halloween spending for 2009 came in at just 4.7 billion dollars. So to say that the celebration of Halloween is growing would be a tremendous understatement. Sadly, most people have no idea where this holiday originally came from. The truth is that a long time ago Catholicism attempted to 'Christianize” an ancient pagan holiday known as Samhain … The origins of Halloween are Celtic in tradition and have to do with observing the end of summer sacrifices to gods in Druidic tradition. In what is now Britain and France, it was the beginning of the Celtic year, and they believed Samhain, the lord of death, sent evil spirits abroad to attack humans, who could escape only by assuming disguises and looking like evil spirits themselves. The waning of the sun and the approach of dark winter made the evil spirits rejoice and play nasty tricks. Believe it or not, most of our Halloween practices can be traced back to these old pagan rites and superstitions . On the Wiccan calendar, Samhain is one of the most important points on 'the wheel of the year”. Wiccans believe that it is the day when 'the god dies”, and subsequently they celebrate his rebirth at Yule. It is also a time when they believe that the veil between the living and the dead is the thinnest, and so it is an opportune time for them to contact the dead. The following is much more on what Wiccans believe about Samhain from wicca.com … Samhain, (pronounced SOW-in, SAH-vin, or SAM-hayne) means 'End of Summer”, and is the third and final Harvest. The dark winter half of the year commences on this Sabbat. It is generally celebrated on October 31st, but some traditions prefer November 1st. It is one of the two 'spirit-nights” each year, the other being Beltane. It is a magical interval when the mundane laws of time and space are temporarily suspended, and the Thin Veil between the worlds is lifted. Communicating with ancestors and departed loved ones is easy at this time, for they journey through this world on their way to the Summerlands. It is a time to study the Dark Mysteries and honor the Dark Mother and the Dark Father, symbolized by the Crone and her aged Consort. Originally the 'Feast of the Dead” was celebrated in Celtic countries by leaving food offerings on altars and doorsteps for the 'wandering dead”. Today a lot of practitioners still carry out that tradition. Single candles were lit and left in a window to help guide the spirits of ancestors and loved ones home. Extra chairs were set to the table and around the hearth for the unseen guest. Apples were buried along roadsides and paths for spirits who were lost or had no descendants to provide for them. Turnips were hollowed out and carved to look like protective spirits, for this was a night of magic and chaos. The Wee Folke became very active, pulling pranks on unsuspecting humans. Traveling after dark was was not advised. People dressed in white (like ghosts), wore disguises made of straw, or dressed as the opposite gender in order to fool the Nature spirits. The ancient practices described in those paragraphs sound very similar to what we do today in many ways, but without a doubt some of the traditions have evolved. For example, instead of carving turnips, those that celebrate Halloween carve pumpkins today. You may not realize this, but Wicca is actually one of the fastest growing religions in America. And on October 31st, Wiccans all over the nation will get together to conduct rituals and cast spells. Here is a blurb from Wikipedia about the Wiccan belief in 'magic”… During ritual practices, which are often staged in a sacred circle , Wiccans cast spells or 'workings” intended to bring about real changes in the physical world. Common Wiccan spells include those used for healing , for protection, fertility, or to banish negative influences. [63] Many early Wiccans, such as Alex Sanders , Sybil Leek and Alex Winfield , referred to their own magic as ' white magic ', which contrasted with ' black magic ', which they associated with evil and Satanism . Sanders also used the similar terminology of ' left hand path ” to describe malevolent magic, and ' right hand path ” to describe magic performed with good intentions; [64] terminology that had originated with the occultist Helena Blavatsky in the 19th century. Some modern Wiccans however have stopped using the white-black magic and left-right hand path dichotomies, arguing for instance that the colour black should not necessarily have any associations with evil. [65] If you are not familiar with these things, you may scoff at such practices. But the cold, hard reality of the matter is that they are very real. The dark side has power too, and those that have come out of witchcraft can tell you some stories that will stand your hair on end. Wiccans think of themselves as 'good”, and so they tend to reject blood sacrifices and things of that nature. But for those that are deeper into the occult, blood sacrifice is an essential part of Halloween. As I mentioned above, many animal shelters all over the nation ban the adoption of black cats this time of the year … It's the week of Halloween, and maybe you don't know this, but if you suddenly wanted to adopt a black cat, you would probably have a hard time. That's because thanks to their association with witchcraft, accepted wisdom holds that Halloween is a time when people ritualistically mutilate black cats. To test if this really was still accepted wisdom, I contacted some animal shelters near to our Los Angeles office, and they all told me they wouldn't let me adopt a black cat. One, The Lange Foundation—the type of animal rescue that takes in cats from city shelters before they can be euthanized—was willing to talk to me on the phone and explain: If someone were to call and ask specifically for a black cat, that would trigger the policy. 'I would say 'not today!'” said one of the foundation's board members, Diana Nelson. You may not want to believe it, but animals will be killed and little children will be abused on Halloween night. The following is what one ex-witch has shared regarding her experiences… My parents told me before we went around the neighborhood we were going to go by the church (Mormon Church) to get some candy there. The church was very close to my grandmother's house, and I knew so from going often. We went to the church and what happened next made my blood curdle. I was given candy, but that was just a preclude to the sexual abuse that would happen in a satanic ritual. On Halloween Satanists use young children, such as myself, as sexual idols to worship. Other children receive a far worse fate. Death. I know for some this is more than you can even think to believe, but it is true. I can barely write these words because the pain of the truth is almost more than I can bear. If it wasn't for the grace and love of Jesus Christ, I would not even be here writing this at all. You may say 'it doesn't mean that to me”, but you are just fooling yourself. Could you take a Satanic Black Mass and turn it into a celebration of Jesus? Of course not. And yet so many Christians fully embrace Halloween and pretend that there is nothing wrong with it. For the record, Satanists absolutely love Halloween. The following comes from the official Church of Satan website … Satanists embrace what this holiday has become, and do not feel the need to be tied to ancient practices. This night, we smile at the amateur explorers of their own inner darkness, for we know that they enjoy their brief dip into the pool of the 'shadow world.” We encourage their tenebrous fantasies, the candied indulgence, and the wide-ranging evocation of our aesthetics (while tolerating some of the chintzy versions), even if it is but once a year. For the rest of the time, when those not of our meta-tribe shake their heads in wonder at us, we can point out that they may find some understanding by examining their own All Hallows Eve doings, but we generally find it simpler to just say: 'Think of the Addams Family and you'll begin to see what we're about.” Satanists consider Halloween to be one of the most important 'holidays” of the year. On page 96 of the Satanic Bible, Anton LaVey wrote the following… 
'After one's own birthday, the two major Satanic holidays are Walpurgisnacht (May 1st) and Halloween.” Isn't that lovely? Despite all of this, most Christians in America will happily celebrate Halloween on October 31st. In fact, one recent survey found that just 8 percent of all Christian pastors want their congregations to skip the holiday altogether. Instead, most of them want their members to invite people to a 'Christian version of Halloween” at their churches. The following comes from Charisma … Two-thirds (67 percent) encourage church members to invite friends and neighbors to a fall festival, trunk-or-treat or judgment house. Pastors at bigger churches (those with 250 or more in attendance) are most likely to ask church members to invite their neighbors (86 percent) to an event at the church. Those from small churches (50 or less in attendance) are least likely (48 percent). If the gospel is preached, I am all for people going to church on October 31st. But all too often these 'alternative celebrations” are nothing more than repackaged versions of the same Satanic holiday that the world is celebrating. I like how Pastor Jamie Morgan described what our approach to this day should be… Setting aside a day to celebrate evil, darkness, witchcraft, fear, death and the demonic brings disdain to God. Period. A Christian celebrating Halloween would be like a Satan worshiper putting up a nativity scene at Christmas while singing, 'Happy Birthday, Jesus!” The two just don't go together. Jesus has nothing in common with Satan (2 Cor. 6:14), and neither should we. And the truth is that God has wanted us to have nothing to do with occult practices from the very beginning. The following is what Deuteronomy 18:9-13 says in the Modern English version … 9 When you enter into the land which the Lord your God gives you, you must not learn to practice the abominations of those nations . 10 There must not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or who uses divination , or uses witchcraft , or an interpreter of omens, or a sorcerer , 11 or one who casts spells , or a spiritualist , or an occultist , or a necromancer . 12 For all that do these things are an abomination to the Lord , and because of these abominations the Lord your God will drive them out from before you. 13 You must be blameless before the Lord your God. There will be many people that will read this article and will continue to celebrate Halloween just as they normally do. If that is you, then you need to understand that engaging in dark practices can open up doors to spiritual darkness for yourself and your entire family. If you do that, then that is your choice, but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord. Submit your review

pay-for-play that the Clinton campaign has taken. Here's a great video by my friends from Truthstream Media with even more revelations. Wikileaks says they have 50,000 of Podesta's private emails.If they keep releasing them in batches, there's a distinct possibility that we will get some on election day itself. I wonder if Wikileaks is keeping the best for last? The desperate attempt to silence Julian Assange The efforts to shut up Assange have led all sorts of ugly places. If you can't drone him ( like Hillary Clinton suggested ), then frame him and accuse him of pedophilia. Wikileaks has provided a timeline and supporting links for the sustained efforts to discredit Assange. May , when self-claimed dating agency 'ToddAndClare” (T&C) approach saying they were contacted by the Russian government. Sep 3 , T&C email Assange's Swedish lawyer Per Samuelson offering one million dollars for Assange to appear in a video advertisement for the 'dating agency” ToddAndClare.com (See attachment). This is the first contact. Sep 15 , email sent from a member of Mr. Assange's defence team to [email protected] requesting further details (See attachment). Sep 19 , [email protected] email with elaborate bonafides, proposed agreement and the claim that the source of the US$1 million is the Russian government. The email states that T&C was approached by Russian representatives in May 2016 and that 'The source of the $1,000,000 is the Russian government” . The email then goes on to 'verify” bonafides by giving a detailed description of the interior of the house and desk of Mr Assange's lawyer, Helena Kennedy, who is a member of the UK Parliament, including a reference to a photo of Tony Blair (Kennedy states that the Blair reference is accurate, although out-of-date). Sep 20 , a representative of Mr Assange's defence team writes to [email protected] stating that the proposal appears to be an 'elaborate scam designed to entrap Mr Assange's reputation into unwanted and unwarranted publicity”. writes stating that 'The offer expires at midnight, October 31 st 2016.” Late Sep , WikiLeaks announces a press conference for Oct 4 for its ten year anniversary. Late Sep , Press widely misreport that WikiLeaks is going to launch its 'October Suprise” against Hillary Clinton on 4 October, misinterpreting its press conference call Oct 4 , T&C files its 'Assange pedophile” libel through the UN's Global Compact system, alleging that there is an active criminal investigation in the Bahamas against Julian Assange for the abuse of an eight year old girl and claiming to have chat logs and photos. The allegation appears on the UN website with a UN Gobal Compact letterhead and is contextualised with a complex backstory. The request targets the UN WGAD (part of the UN Human Rights system) which found that Mr Assange is being illegally detained by the United Kingdom and Sweden. Oct 4 , T&C files claim through the UK courts, apparently using it as a method to place the pedophile accusation into the public record (See attachment). Oct 4 , WikiLeaks holds a press conference, where it becomes clear that its publishing of Clinton-related documents will occur later. Oct 5 , T&C's UK court claim arrives at Ecuadorian embassy in London Oct 7 , WikiLeaks commenses its release of the Podesta Emails Oct 11 , T&C pushes out its Assange pedophile claim through the PRWeb newswire service. Oct 12 , UN Global Compact delists T&C , citing 'integrity” issues. Oct 12 , T&C issues a press release opposing the UN delisting with an elaborate story, claiming that Julian Assange is threatening US citizens (T&C). Oct 17 , Investigative report into Toddandclare.com prepared for Mr Assange's lawyers is concluded, finding 'T&C Network Solutions exhibits the characteristics of a highly suspicious and likely fabricated business entity” (See attachment 'FINAL REPORT T&C 17 Oct 2016”). Oct 18 , The pedophile part of the plot is launched through US Democrat-aligned website DailyKos and pushed by pro-Clinton twitter accounts. Now, I'm no stranger to the tinfoil, but this seems to me the most blatant attempt to discredit someone that I've ever seen. The timing is quite the coincidence, don't you think? For more Assange, here are some of the conspiracy theories that have been going 'round the internet lately. Assange has made some incredibly powerful enemies. His longevity is far from certain. And then there was that day that the US internet got hacked. First, there was this tweet by Wikileaks, which was pinned on Twitter all day. Zero Hedge reported : The 'police” presence apparently began to amass earlier this week just as Wikileaks confirmed that the Ecuadorian had agreed to cut Julian Assange's internet access after a little political pressure from John Kerry…and as an allegedly bogus plot, with links to the Clinton campaign, was revealed that attempted to link Julian Assange to a pedophilia ring. Shortly after the Tweet appeared, the internet went down over much of the United States. Dozens of websites such as Twitter, Reddit, Amazon, Netflix, the New York Times and Spotify, as well as general internet service in certain areas of the country, were all down for part of the day (the entire list is at this link) . A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack was blamed for the outage. Ironically, NorseCorp , the company that has the real-time cyber attack map, was also down for most of the day. This happened not once, but twice. The FBI and the DHS are investigating the cyber attack so I'm sure we'll get the *truth* soon. Rumors abound, including blaming Russia (of course, and after VP Biden's idiotic threat to cyber attack them , could you really blame them?), that it was our own government hoping to cover up some even they'd like to distract us from, or, interestingly, that it was a hacker group who did this in defense of Julian Assange. (Wikileaks seems to think that too – see the screenshot below of their Tweet.) But…another group altogether has taken credit for the massive hack. SHTFplan reports that this is the beginning of WW3 – which could be fought online : A hacking collective calling itself 'New World Hackers” are taking credit – and they are based out of Russia and China, so there is little doubt that it will fuel the narrative for more war, tighter security and an age of online instability as the new world (where the dollar is no longer king) is sorted out. New World Hackers responded to a request for an interview with Anon Intel Group . Their message to the world? 'Stay educated.” Anything to add to Survival Saturday?

Date: October 29, 2016 By: Wayne Thomas, Nation One News | In a White House invitation only event, 'Science” conference. Barack Obama went off topic to discuss the Media. Specifically, what he called the 'magazines you get at the grocery store”. He characterized this kind of media as a problem. His comments came following a lengthy conference with a room full of Obama's scientific elite. So of course, his comments were well received by the audience. It is not hard to interpret what Obama is talking about. He is talking about papers like ours. We are not controlled by anyone except our own conscience. We use titles that encourage people to read our content. But, you won't find us in the Grocery store. No, you will find us everywhere else. We check our facts and all too often they don't agree with what the mainstream media wants you to believe! He begins by saying: 'We are going to have to rebuild, within this wild, wild west of information flow; some sort of curating function” You will notice he explains how the media was once easy to control when he says: 'It used to be there were three television stations, and Walter Cronkite was there” He goes on in an attempt to bundle everyone who disagrees with them into the same group as conspiracy theorists by saying: there were always those WHO didn't agree, and [chuckle THEY] didn't believe we landed on the moon or that Elvis is dead. He makes a striking admission when he says: It wasn't always as democratic as it should have been. He closes his idea by saying: There has to be some for of way we can sort through information that passes some sort of truthyness test. I don't need to remind you that Barrack Obama is speaking to a room full of hundreds of very influential people. These include teachers, scientists, and even politicians. Barack Obama just instructed that community to find a way to Censor Free Press without calling it 'Censoring the FREE PRESS.” Within days of his statements, we see the Establishment Media targeting small sites and up and coming news sources such as Breitbart. We wrote a story about this earlier today. There have also been hundreds of reports of censorship by Facebook, which we will report on in the coming days. Barack Obama never mentioned Donald Trump, but one has to wonder why now? Why now, after forty years of the unmolested free press does the Establishment want to Censor it? The answer is right in front of you , after all, look at what you are reading, and who published it. We are not ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, or FOX. We are nationwide Media organization not motived by money, and we run on a shoestring budget.We are the FREE PRESS!

in: War Propaganda , World News (image credit: AP) The battle for Mosul is more about redeploying thousands of US-supported ISIS fighters to Syria, along with perhaps letting Turkish forces move in to control evacuated areas. Erdogan long coveted Mosul. He may think now's his chance to seize the city and its lucrative oil reserves, claiming it's a buffer zone against Kurdish fighters, similar to his northern Syria occupation. According to Syrian parliamentarian Hohammad Kheir Akam, '(t)he US has opened a southern side of Mosul (corridor) to the terrorists to” let thousands of its fighters enter Syria. US-led coalition warplanes easily spot their convoys. Yet they're allowed to move freely – America supporting terrorists it claims to oppose. Iraqi Ansarullah al-Nujaba Movement spokesman Hashem al-Moussavi said 'Washington is still continuing its military support for the terrorists in” his country, airdropping them weapons and other supplies. 'Our forces have filmed US aircraft while dropping military aids for” ISIS terrorist fighters, he said. Iraq's Hassan Abdel Hadi said government forces are concerned about US aerial attacks, impeding their advance to ISIS-controlled areas. 'Unfortunately, there are still some people in Iraq who have been deceived by the US-led coalition, while Washington supports ISIL and is trying to compensate for the damage done” to their fighters by government forces, he explained. Last Friday, Russia's Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov said US-led coalition warplanes struck a funeral procession. 'Dozens of Iraqi civilians died, including women and children,” he explained. 'Russian reconnaissance pinpointed two jets conducting airstrikes on Daquq, located 30 kilometers to the south of Kirkuk, where, according to our data, there are no ISIS fighters,” – a willful war crime. They're 'almost a daily routine for the (US-led) international coalition. Too often weddings, funerals, hospitals, police stations, and humanitarian convoys are being hit by the coalition warplanes.” Russian General Sergey Rudskoy said '(w)e are closely monitoring the situation around Mosul. So far we see no substantial progress in liberating this city from…ISIS” since operations began on October 16 – because no effort is made to do it. Last week, a coalition airstrike targeted a mosque south of Kirkuk, killing over a dozen women and children. A southern Mosul girl's school was struck. US-led coalition warplanes were operating in the area, clearly responsible for what happened. On October 25, Russia's Defense Ministry reported over 60 civilians killed, over 200 others injured on airstrikes on residential areas in Mosul – locations where no ISIS fighters were present. So far, no fighting inside Mosul was reported. By the time, so-called liberating forces enter the city, ISIS fighters will be gone – redeployed to Syria to combat government troops and civilians. Moscow letting this happen without resistance so far makes the battle to liberate Syria harder. Is an offensive planned to rectify this blunder, compounded by failing to launch airstrikes against al-Nusra terrorists in eastern Aleppo since October 18? According to General Rudskoy, Russian Aerospace forces are monitoring the situation in the area of the Syrian-Iraqi border day and night with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles and other reconnaissance means.” 'Russian planes are on patrol missions in the airspace and are ready to immediately deliver strikes against terrorists.” Aerial operations 'in a 10-km zone around Aleppo” remain suspended. 'The moratorium…will be extended.” The longer Russia delays full-scale aerial operations against US-supported terrorists infesting eastern Aleppo, the harder the struggle ahead to liberate the city and all key parts of Syria.

By: The Voice of Reason | Has everyone forgotten the reality of what wins Presidential Races? It's the Electoral College, not Polls! With less than two weeks until election day, and reports already circling that the military is drilling for 'Authoritarian Rule of Law” (Martial Law) , to deal with the potential masses who refuse to accept the election's outcome, why is everyone talking about the polls, and not what really matters? Thanks to a DNC insider, we learned back in August that we should ignore the mainstream media polls, because even back then Clinton was reportedly being pounded. More recently, this past Friday, we learned that the Chairman of Hillary's presidential campaign, John Podesta, who previously served as Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton, and later as Counselor to President Barack Obama, issued a playbook to pollsters for exactly how to manipulate the polling numbers that produced false results favoring Hillary Clinton, results the media has been all too eager to report for months now. So, when we already know the polls are total B.S., what kills me is when I see reports like the one mentioned in the second video below, where Gary Franchi of The Next News Network reviews a recent article from Truthfeed which suggests that while publicly the Clinton Campaign is acting dismissive of Trump 's chances, in private the campaign and their mainstream media henchmen are in full panic mode. Gary Franchi reports that early voting results, as well as national polling data in recent days, suggest that something remarkable might be going on regarding the 2016 presidential race… Reports like the ones below by Truthfeed, Gary Franchi of The Next News Network , and by Alex Jones (where he declares Trump the winner of the 2016 election), are dangerous, particularly when they are citing the same polls we already know are bogus. There needs to be more discussion on the harsh reality of what it's going to take for Trump to win this election, and that is to say there needs to be more discussion about the Electoral Map. It's confusing to some, so they avoid it, but it's also reality, so they better pay attention to it! One of many reasons this country runs the risk of tearing itself to shreds after the winner of the 2016 is declared, is because it's not at all unforeseeable, that Donald Trump could win the popular vote by millions, but yet still legitimately lose the election. We do not live in a Democracy. We live in a constitutional republic, and our election laws, and the role of the electoral college are clear. Whether I agree with the current system or not is irrelevant. What IS relevant, is that for Trump to win the presidency under our current system of government, he's going to need an act of Divine Intervention. In the video below, I explain in detail why the chances of a Trump win are so remote, and how Americans better start to brace themselves for what they plan to do when Hillary is announced the next President of the United States. I expect a great deal of violence regardless of who wins the election, so it's important people understand the reality ahead of time. In the video below, The Next News Network reviews a recent article in Truthfeed suggesting that while publicly they are acting dismissive of Trump 's chances, in private the Clinton Campaign and their mainstream media henchmen are in panic mode. Gary Franchi reports that early voting results, as well as national polling data in recent days suggest something remarkable might be going on regarding the 2016 presidential race… As I explained very clearly above, people should be much more cautious about getting too optimistic when it comes to Trump 's chances of winning. Remember, even if Trump does win, there is still the matter of the far left promising to cause so much chaos, Martial Law HAS to be declared, forcing Obama to stay in office.

in: Science & Technology October 28, 2016 marks the official launch of Zerocash ('Zcash,” 'ZEC”), a new cryptocurrency that has received tremendous attention from the Bitcoin community. The technology is named for its zero-identity function of shielding transactions on its blockchain, or digital ledger. 'Zerocash is a new protocol that provides a privacy-preserving version of Bitcoin (or a similar currency),” its developers explain . '[I]n Zerocash, users may pay one another directly, via payment transactions that reveal neither the origin, destination, or amount of the payment.” The enthusiasm surrounding the coin is demonstrated in the recent price for Zerocash futures contracts, representing one unit and valued against the price of one Bitcoin (BTC). Between September 15th and October 26th the price surged almost 1,300%—from a low of $18 (0.027 BTC) to a high of $261 (0.379 BTC). Upon its October 28 debut the price of one Zcash actually exceeded $100,000,000 (one million) on some exchanges , with an average of about around $15,000. The high valuation and scarcity is at least partly influenced by the novel way Zcash is being introduced. The cryptocurrency will not be initially available to investors for over-the-counter purchases and can only be obtained in gradually increasing increments over a month-long period through ' mining, ” or digital production by those with the necessary computer equipment and technological expertise. An additional reason for the building excitement around Zcash is that its development team consists of notable computer scientists at University of California at Berkeley, Johns Hopkins University, Tel Aviv University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology state actors, including Amazon, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Office of Naval Research, and the Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology. The entire list of funders is as follows: *Amazon.com *Tel Aviv University Authentication Initiative *Center for Science of Information (CSoI), an NSF Science and Technology Center *Check Point Institute for Information Security *U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) *Air Force Research Laboratory *European Community's Seventh Framework Programme *Israeli Centers of Research Excellence I-CORE program *Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology *The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust *Office of Naval Research *Simons Foundation *Skolkovo Foundation Libertarians especially, with their philosophical antipathy toward state monopoly that central banking epitomizes have been among the most vigorous supporters of cryptocurrency development and use. This is accentuated by the fact that traditional markets for 'hard money” investment such as precious metals are likewise subject to heavy manipulation by the same or allied central banking outlets. Yet one would be hard-pressed to come up with a greater illustration of centralized state power than the array of interests listed above. Indeed, the involvement of such actors in developing the 'next Bitcoin” should be recognized vis-a-vis the Western financial community's continued advocacy for the drastic reduction of conventional central bank-issued currency from circulation (i.e. here , here , here , here and here ). In theory Zerocash differs from Bitcion in that it represents a bolstered technology for anonymous transactions veiled from third party scrutiny. According to the mechanics such transactions may be viewed and recorded by the specific parties who obtains proper authorization. What if a Trojan Horse capability could be engineered into the currency that might later be utilized by lettered agencies? This is the greatest fear of those who rightly question the loss of tangible exchange. Further, such a development would defeat ZeroCash's desirability and purpose. By dismissing the possibility of such a feature Zcash users implicitly rely on the integrity of the developers themselves, most of whom are junior faculty or graduate students whose research, as noted, is at least partly funded by such deep state actors. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts regard cryptocurrencies as a sort of deus ex machina against the state. Along these lines, Zerocash's institutional and scholarly veneer cloaks the more complex grant-generating interests lurking in the shadows. Recently even strong advocates of Bitcoin have pondered if the financial medium may have been developed with direct or indirect participation of the intelligence community. In the case of Zcash there can be no doubt of such deep state interest and involvement, which is of no small concern as the world moves toward a seemingly inevitable 'cashless society.” Submit your review

in: Human Rights , War Propaganda , World News Minister of war Avigdor Lieberman is part of Israel's lunatic fringe – ruthless, lawless, racist, militant, extremist and nightmarish for Palestinians. A former nightclub bouncer in Moldova before moving to Israel in 1978, he heads the ultranationalist Israel Beiteinu party. Its agenda includes no concessions, no settlement freeze, no Palestinian self-determination (except maybe on worthless, isolated bantustans), no peace process whether or not he admits it. On Monday, Lieberman said Israel's next war on Gaza will be its last 'because we will completely destroy them,” adding: 'As minister of defense (sic), I would like to clarify that we have no intention of starting a new war against our neighbors (sic) in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank, Lebanon or Syria.” 'But in Gaza, like the Iranians, they intend to eliminate the state of Israel…If they impose the next war on Israel, it will be their last. I would like to emphasize again: It will be their last confrontation because we will completely destroy them.” Destroy means genocide. Two million Gazans are trapped by illegal siege and blockade, unable to seek safety next time Israel preemptively attacks them – virtually certain to be worse than last time based on Lieberman's threat alone. How much death and destruction is too much? How much suffering must Palestinians endure to be free from a gangster, Arab-hating Jewish state? How long will Americans tolerate Washington funding its killing machine with their tax dollars – used for mass slaughter and ruthless persecution? How long will Israelis put up with racist, fascist governance threatening their security and well-being? Israel waged three wars of aggression on Gaza since December 2008/January 2009 – Cast Lead, Pillar of Cloud in 2012 and Protective Edge in 2014, each exponentially more destructive than the previous hostilities. Further conflict is certain, likely far more severe than earlier, based on the trend of the last three, exacerbated by lunatics like Lieberman in charge of warmaking, along with leadership under Netanyahu just as bad.

(image credit: AP) If you signed up for Obamacare, you've been screwed. If you didn't sign up and opted to pay the penalties, you've been screwed. If you didn't sign up, didn't pay penalties, and stuck with your original insurance company, you've been screwed. If you didn't sign up, didn't pay penalties, and paid cash for medical care, you've been screwed. Every person in America has been affected, regardless of what you did or did not do. That's because the Affordable Care Act irrevocably ruined our access to medical care at an affordable price in this country. In the mere span of 4 years, the prices have skyrocketed and many families have to pay more in monthly premiums than they pay on their mortgages. Meanwhile, medical costs have been driven up to astronomical prices, making it nearly impossible to pay out-of-pocket for care. And these premiums? They are for the crappiest coverage you can imagine. Some families pay $1500-2000 a month for 60% coverage after they pay the $5000 deductible. That's nearly $20,000 per year before Obamacare pays for a penny of their costs. And now…now that insurance companies have gone belly up when they were forced to become a part of the 'exchange,” medical costs are skyrocketing, doctors won't see patients who aren't 'covered,” employers stopped offering insurance as a benefit, and people lost their jobs due to Obamacare costs… The whole thing is failing. Even President Obama has admitted it . And now we have proof that it was planned that way. But that isn't the worst of it. The worst of it is that this program was designed to fail and steer us into single payer healthcare, where a government entity can decide what procedures will or will not be covered. They'll decide who is deserving of cancer treatment and who is not. They'll mandate things like flu shots and childhood vaccines. One of the recent Wikileaks shows that Hillary Clinton knew this and was complicit. Melissa Dykes of The Daily Sheeple wrote : In an email thread dated September 26, 2015 between Hillary and her senior policy adviser Ann O'Leary titled 'Memo on Cadillac Tax for HRC,” Hillary wrote, ' Given the politics now w bipartisan support including Schumer, I'll support repeal w 'sense of the Senate' that revenues would have to be found. I'd be open to a range of options to do that. But we have to be careful that the R version passes which begins the unraveling of the ACA .” 'Which begins the unraveling of the Affordable Care Act.” A Democrat supporting Republican legislation to destroy Obamacare on purpose. How many millions have they raked in on this deal and bilked the American people for in Obamacare penalties because they can't afford the 'affordable” health care? And the American people will look at this like a 'victory” when it does unravel, even though it has been the plan all along. Hillary Clinton, that savior of woman and children, knew that this would fail. She is supporting the legislation to destroy it, leaving everyone in America at the mercy of the horrible replacement that she will dream up to redistribute wealth and deal the death blow to the already-struggling middle class. Mark my words, as bad as this disaster is, it is only going to get worse. Watch this video for the full story. Article first posted at DaisyLuther.com Submit your review

in: Politics , War Propaganda If you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as 'dangerous” and 'temperamental”, because it is Clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades . Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election I am fully convinced that World War 3 will begin before her time in the White House is over. Someone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters , Trump recently stated that we are 'going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton”… On Syria's civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict. Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and 'safe zones” on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets. 'What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,” said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. 'You're going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.” In order to have a no-fly zone in Syria, you would have to enforce it. And in order to enforce it, you would have to be willing to shoot at the Russians. According to National Intelligence Director James Clapper , that could have dire consequences… Russia could shoot down a U.S. aircraft if a no-fly zone were imposed over Syria, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Tuesday. 'I wouldn't put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,” Clapper said, speaking with CBS' Charlie Rose at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York about several national security issues. Of course Clapper is not alone in that assessment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Francis Dunford, says that imposing a no-fly zone over all of Syria 'would require us to go to war” … 'Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,… That's a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I'm not going to make.” ( Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added) But Hillary Clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants. You see, the truth is that Hillary Clinton wants to win the war that she started in Syria. Back in 2011, she spearheaded an effort along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey to try to use the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East as an opportunity to try to overthrow President Assad in Syria. If it wasn't for her meddling, millions of refugees would not be pouring into Europe and elsewhere, and there would be no 'humanitarian crisis” in Syria at all. Thanks to Russian intervention, the war in Syria is not too far from being over, but the Obama administration is desperate to keep it going. They understand that if Assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted, and that is why they are so determined to keep Aleppo from falling. Without Aleppo, many of the jihadist rebels that the Obama administration has been supporting won't have anywhere to hide. So the Obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the Syrian military, and the Russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen . If Obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against Syrian forces and the Russians start shooting back, that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control. One recent survey found that current American leadership has a 1 percent approval rating in Russia right now, and the Russians dislike Hillary Clinton even more than they dislike Barack Obama. The Russians know that if Hillary Clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us, and that is why they desperately want Donald Trump to win in November. You can see this outlook reflected in comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin recently made about the two candidates … 'Mrs. Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russia. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, calls for cooperation – at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism,” Putin said. 'Naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us. And we consider it wrong, that we always have to be in conflict with one another, creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world,” Putin noted. Anyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that Hillary Clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for Russia. The thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate, but it may soon become a reality. And even now, the Obama administration and our NATO allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with Moscow. This week it is being reported that NATO troops will soon be sent to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania … Nine hundred US troops are to be sent to eastern Europe next year as America's troubled relationship with Russia enters new, uncertain territory. A US-led battle group of NATO allied soldiers will be sent to Poland as part of the multi-nation operation. British forces will lead one of the four battle groups in Estonia, Canada will spearhead the presence in Latvia and Germany will be present in Lithuania. In addition, Infowars is reporting that U.S. Marines will soon be stationed in Norway near the border with Russia… After accepting a Pentagon proposal, Norway will host US Marines at a base near the Russian border as Russia deploys nuclear-capable ships to Kaliningrad. A rotating force of approximately 330 Marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of Vaernes, just outside Trondheim, beginning in January. Norway and Russia share an 122-mile border in the Arctic. 'The US initiative to augment their training and exercises in Norway by locating a Marine Corps Rotational Force in Norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship,” said Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen Søreide. Most Americans aren't aware of any of this, nor do they really care about our relationship with Russia. But in Russia things are completely different. The possibility of war with the United States is the biggest news story over there these days , and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation … Russian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. At the Kremlin's Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. The country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. I know that I have been writing about this over and over , but the truth is that we are on a path to war with Russia, and the election of Hillary Clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war. In my controversial new book , I expressed my belief that war with Russia is coming, but at the time that I wrote it I didn't know how the election would turn out. At this point it looks like Clinton is very likely to win on November 8th, and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with Russia. If you are reading this and you are considering voting for Hillary Clinton, please don't do it . We simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the White House at this critical time. If the American people do choose Hillary Clinton this November, I believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly, bitterly regret in future years. Submit your review

Speaking at the Valdai International Discussion Club in Sochi on Thursday, Putin said Russian patience has limits. 'We('ve) show(n) restraint so far and (haven't) respond(ed) to our partners (sic) in the same gauche manner, but everything has its limits. We can do it,” he explained. So what is he waiting for, given endless US provocations, refusing mutual cooperation on vital issues, rejecting normal relations, heading inevitably for war unless challenged and stopped. He's not stupid or uninformed. Russia's intelligence capability likely matches America's, so he knows what it's up to in Eastern Europe, Syria, elsewhere in the Middle East, along with virtually everywhere else. Pretending both countries are 'partners” defies logic. Thinking mutual cooperation with Washington is possible one day is like waiting for Godot. And things may get exponentially worse once Hillary succeeds Obama, a virtual certainty at this point by fair or foul means – likely the latter, election theft a longstanding US tradition, showing democracy in America is pure fantasy. On Thursday, screaming deceptive Western headlines outrageously blamed Russia and Syria for bombing a Syrian school in Idlib province. It was a hoax. No bombing occurred. US-supported terrorists attacked the school, killing at least six children, injuring many others. An exclusive RT International investigation determined that 'a gas canister and a mine landed in a classroom in Hadaiq al-Andalus” – projectiles launched from terrorist-controlled eastern Aleppo. Yet media scoundrels irresponsibly blamed Russia and Syria – while ignoring daily eastern Aleppo shelling, US supported terrorists killing and injuring civilians in government controlled parts of the city. Long before Internet access to important information from reliable independent sources, famed humorist/social commentator Will Rogers once said: 'All I know is just what I read in the papers, and that's an alibi for my ignorance.” Reporting then was deplorable. Today it's beyond the pale. It's hard imagining why anyone wastes time and money on pure rubbish – or believes television news is credible. Media misinformation proliferates. Readers, viewers and listeners are systematically lied to. Daily fare isn't fit to print or broadcast. Mainstream editors, reporters and commentators are a virtual Noah's Ark of scam artists. On Thursday, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov called video footage of the Idlib incident shown on Western television fake – 'more than ten edited fragments assembled together,” he explained. No Russian or Syrian warplanes were in the area when the attack occurred. No bomb craters existed. Damage to the school was inconsistent to a bombing. Only one wall was damaged, not the ceiling, desks or chairs. Had a bombing occurred, the blast would have destroyed or severely damaged the building. Furniture inside would have been 'swept away.” 'As one can see on a photo from the Russian drone, the roof of the school is not damaged and there are no bomb craters in the area adjacent to the school,” Konashenkov explained. A US drone in the area at the time of the attack has the same footage. Yet Washington concealed what should have been revealed straightaway to set the record straight. 'UNICEF leadership fell…victim to a new deception of swindlers and (Al Qaeda-affiliated) White Helmets,” said Konashenkov. Washington perhaps orchestrated what happened, part of its sinister anti-Russia/anti-Syria agenda. Submit your review

in: Politics , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests Will this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , 'voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere.” Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. Many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News … Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. 'If anybody can sit there and say they don't think this is a contentious election, then they aren't paying much attention,” Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. And without a doubt, voting locations are 'soft targets” that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters … 'There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didn't have 15 or 20 years ago,” said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. ' What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then that's certainly concerning.” All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. Let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. Another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania … 'We don't want to lose an election because you know what I'm talking about,” Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. 'Because you know what? That's a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places .” And of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats… Early voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. Republican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. 'I tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent,” Moynihan said. 'You could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat.” In addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . Well, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation … According to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. The McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation – apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007 – when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? Either way, it doesn't look good. After everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. But Democrats don't like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters… 'It's un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that ,” Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book ' Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America ,” previously told The Christian Science Monitor. 'Voting was very, very dangerous. I don't think anyone's suggesting that we're at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic.” Without a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. But will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? If that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed. Submit your review

in: Government Corruption , Mainstream Media , US News , Whistle Blowers Let's talk about Wikileaks. First of all, the organization was founded by Julian Assange back in 2006. Their website explains what they are all about: 'WikiLeaks specializes in the analysis and publication of large datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials involving war, spying, and corruption. It has so far published more than 10 million documents and associated analyses.” In the 11 years that they've been publishing documents, they have not been disproven a single time. Their record for authentication is perfect. (Learn more here and here .) So this means that a person would be pretty silly to disregard anything in the reams of information about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party, the Clinton Foundation, and the political shenanigans that would put the Machiavellis to shame. Here are 21 of the most important things that have come out about Hillary Clinton, that unfortunately, no one is reporting on in the mainstream. In the interest of brevity, each topic has a link to an article that goes deeper into the leak. (In no particular order.) John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign had a nice cozy dinner with Peter Kadzik, one of the top officials in the Department of Justice…the day after the Benghazi hearing . Kadzik's son also asked for a job on the Clinton campaign, and, the icing on the corruption cupcake? Kadzik led the effort to nominate Loretta Lynch, who famously met with Bill Clinton on her private plane right before Hillary's interrogation about Emailgate. ( source ) We all knew that the Clinton Foundation was just a way for the Clinton family to launder money, and now there's proof. Zero Hedge writes, '…today's Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals, for the first time, the precise financial flows between the Clinton Foundation, Band's firm Teneo Consulting, and the Clinton family's private business endeavors.” A pundit called this leak 'The Rosetta Stone of the Clinton Foundation,” meaning that with this document, all of their shady financial dealings could be unraveled and translated. ( source ) Clinton is unable to speak for very long without a podium to lean on . Numerous leaked emails reference how certain interviews have to be kept short because she'd be without one. And this article references a very interesting reason why this may be the case – surprisingly it isn't related to her health. ( source ) The leaks also show that Clinton intends to do her best to restrict the Second Amendment. Brian Fallon, the national press secretary for the Clinton campaign, wrote, ' Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President – universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability .” According to an analysis on The Daily Sheeple, 'Imposing manufacturer liability means that after Sandy Hook, Bushmaster and Remington Arms would have been prosecuted for having a hand in the murder of children and school staff members for firearms that were legally sold.” ( source ) The campaign was concerned that the sexual escapades of Bill Clinton could be likened to those of another disgraced celebrity, Bill Cosby . Political operative Ron Klain sent an urgent email saying that Hillary should anticipate the following questions, ” How is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did? Is his conduct relevant to your campaign? You said every woman should be believed. Why not the women who accused him? Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?” ( source ) Clinton's campaign deliberately leaked an embarrassing photo of a swimsuit-clad Bernie Sanders to the press, ironically insinuating that it was proof he was bought off by Wall Street. Perez Hilton wrote, ' Bernie Sanders lounges at elite Martha's Vineyard pool, summer 2015 after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists .” ( source ) Clinton admitted she is out of touch with the middle class in a speech to Goldman-Black Rock in 2014. 'And I am not taking a position on any policy, but I do think there is a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged. And I never had that feeling when I was growing up. Never. I mean, were there really rich people, of course there were. My father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle class upbringing. We had good public schools. We had accessible health care. We had our little, you know, one-family house that, you know, he saved up his money, didn't believe in mortgages. So I lived that. And now, obviously, I'm kind of far removed because the life I've lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy , but I haven't forgotten it.” ( source ) She made this rather NWO remark at a 2013 paid speech to Brazilian bank Banco Itau: ' My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders , some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.” ( source ) In a leak of yet another paid speech, this time to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago in 2013, Clinton said that Jordan and Turkey ' can't possibly vet all those refugees so they don't know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.” Meanwhile, if Clinton has her way , we will be warmly welcoming 65,000 refugees a year, which makes Obama's 10,000 a year look like small potatoes. ( source ) Clinton blackmailed the Chinese by telling them that the US would base missiles in the region if they didn't exert some control over North Korean aggression. ' So China, come on. You either control them or we're going to have to defend against them ,” she purportedly told the audience at a Goldman Sachs conference in June 2013. ( source ) In May 2015, Clinton was no longer Secretary of State but was ready to announce she was running for President when she was invited to attend a summit in Morrocco. The implication from the leaked emails was that a $12 million 'donation” from the king of Morocco was dependent on Clinton attending the summit. Human Abedin, usually loyal to her boss, had concerns . ' If HRC was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter. She created this mess and she knows it. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this,” Abedin wrote to Robbie Mook in a November 2014 email. Incidentally, Clinton didn't attend. Bill and Chelsea went instead and the $12 million donation was not forthcoming. (source ) Podesta attacked Clinton's primary election rival Bernie Sanders for criticizing the Paris climate change agreement. ' Can you believe that doofus Bernie attacked it? ” said Podesta. ( source ) Clinton told a Goldman Sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in Syria . ' My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,” she told employees of the bank in South Carolina, which had paid her about $225,000 to give a speech. 'We used to be much better at this than we are now. Now, you know, everybody can't help themselves. They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: Look what we're doing and I want credit for it. ” (source ) There is indeed a definite link between the Clinton campaign and what MSM is allowed to say. The campaign has colluded directly with media spokespersons that read like a Who's Who in American Media : Dan Merica from CNN, Haim Saban of Univision, John Harwood of CNBC and the NY Times, Rebecca Quick of CNBC, Maggie Haberman of NY Times and Politico, John Harris of Politico, Donna Brazile formerly of CNN, Roland Martin of TV-One, Marjorie Pritchard of The Boston Globe, and Louise Mensch of Heat Street. ( source ) As everyone knows, the DNC deliberately screwed Bernie Sanders out of the nomination ( Bonus: Wikileaks also released some of the DNC's voicemails on the topic ). There are emails that prove who is actually pulling HRC's puppet strings and that puppeteer is George Soros . The shadow government is not just a conspiracy theory – it really exists and Hillary's job is to keep George Soros happy. ( source ) Excerpts from her speeches to Wall Street read like a guide to two-faced treachery. In them, she clearly points out that sometimes you 'need” to lie. 'If everybody's watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.” ( source ) Wikileaks emails show that back when she still worked for CNN and before she became an employee of the Clinton campaign, Donna Brazile gave Hillary the questions in advance for her 'impromptu” CNN Town Hall questions. ( source ) The campaign got to 'approve” articles in influential publications like NY Times, HuffPo, CNN, NBC, CBS, NYT, MSNBC, and Politico, showing a massive collusion with the mainstream media, who has hounded Trump relentlessly in an effort to distract from HRC's abysmal candidacy. ( source ) Through the treasure trove of Wikileaks emails, we can gain an accurate picture of how Hillary really feels about us all (spoiler: basket of deplorables, basement dwellers and right wing conspirators) ( source ) President Obama knew the whole time that her emails were not coming from the secure State Department server. Cheryl Mills wrote to John Podesta, 'W e need to clean this up – he has emails from her – they do not say state.gov .” You see, Obama's emails all have to be from”whitelisted”addresses. So someone, somewhere, added her nonsecure email to his whitelist. ( source ) And finally, here's the real reason that treacherous shrew is involved in politics. And let me tell you, it isn't because she yearns to make things better for anyone but herself. (emphasis mine.) At the Goldman Sachs Builders and Innovators Summit, Clinton responded to a question from chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, who quipped that you 'go to Washington” to 'make a small fortune.” Clinton agreed with the comment and complained about ethics rules that require officials to divest from certain assets before entering government. ' There is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives, ” Clinton said. ( source ) Together, we cannot be ignored. I am on a mission between now and the Presidential Election on November 8th and I hope that you will join me. I am going to work day and night to provide the coverage that the mainstream media is not. It isn't until we combine all of our voices that we can make people listen to the scandals, the rigging, and the corruption, not only in this election but in the system in general. Please join your voice with mine by liking, sharing, and spreading the word. Together, we cannot be ignored. Together, we are an army. Article first posted at DaisyLuther.com Submit your review

in: General Health , Medical & Health , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests I've written many articles on the hazards and drawbacks of getting a mammogram, which include: 
• The risk of false positives . Besides leading to unnecessary mental anguish and medical treatment, a false cancer diagnosis may also interfere with your eligibility for medical insurance, which can have serious financial ramifications 
• The risk of false negatives , which is of particular concern for dense-breasted women 
• The fact that ionizing radiation actually causes cancer and may contribute to breast cancer when done over a lifetime. 
Results published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) show that women carrying the BRCA1/2 gene mutation are particularly vulnerable to radiation-induced cancer 1 
• The fact that studies repeatedly find that mammograms have no impact on mortality rates As so expertly demonstrated in the video above, created by Dr. Andrew Lazris and environmental scientist, Erik Rifkin, Ph.D., it's easy to misunderstand the benefits of mammograms. Mammograms are said to reduce your risk of dying from breast cancer by 20 percent, but unless you understand where this number comes from, you'll be vastly overestimating the potential benefit of regular mammogram screening . Most doctors also fail to inform patients about the other side of the equation, which is that far more women are actually harmed by the procedure than benefit from it. 1 in 1,000 Women Is Saved by Regular Mammogram Screening While 10 Undergo Cancer Treatment for No Reason Incredible as it may sound, the 20 percent mortality risk reduction touted by conventional medicine actually amounts to just 1 woman per 1,000 who get regular mammograms. How can that be? As explained in the video, for every 1,000 women who do not get mammograms, 5 of them will die of breast cancer. For every 1,000 women who do get mammograms, 4 will die anyway. The difference between the two groups is 20 percent (the difference of that one person in the mammogram group whose life is saved). On the other side of the equation, out of every 1,000 women who get regular mammograms over a lifetime: HALF will receive a false positive. So while they do NOT have cancer, about 500 out of every 1,000 women getting mammograms will face the terror associated with a breast cancer diagnosis 64 will get biopsies, which can be painful and carry risks of adverse effects 10 will go on to receive cancer treatment for what is in actuality NOT cancer, including disfiguring surgery and toxic drugs or radiation. Surgery, chemo and radiation are all risky, and dying from the treatment for a cancer you do not have is doubly tragic All things considered, the evidence seems quite clear; most women should probably avoid mammograms, as they cause far more harm than good. Many studies have now come to that conclusion, and the most recent research, 2 published just in time for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, again hammers home that point. Harms of Mammography Eclipse Benefits For this study, the researchers analyzed U.S. cancer statistics collected by the government in order to estimate the effectiveness of mammography. By comparing records of breast cancers diagnosed in women over the age of 40 between 1975 and 1979 — a time before mammograms came into routine use — and between 2000 and 2002, three key findings emerged. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 The incidence of large tumors (2 centimeters or larger) has declined, from 68 percent to 32 percent The number of women diagnosed with small tumors has increased, from 36 to 64 percent The incidence of metastatic cancer, which is the most lethal, has remained stable This may initially sound like good news for mammograms, but in absolute numbers, the decrease in large tumors was actually rather small — a mere 30 tumors less per 100,000 women. Meanwhile, the dramatic increase in small tumors was mostly attributed to overdiagnosis — an estimated 81 percent of these small tumors did not actually need treatment. The fact that metastatic cancer rates remained even suggests we're not catching more of them, earlier. Instead, we're catching and treating mostly harmless tumors. The researchers also found that two-thirds of the reduction in breast cancer mortality was attributable to improved treatment, such as the use of tamoxifen. Breast cancer screening only accounted for one-third of the reduction in mortality. Lead researcher Dr. H.Gilbert Welch explains the findings of the study in the video above. As reported by WebMD: 9 'The upshot, according to Welch, is that mammography is more likely to 'overdiagnose' breast cancer than to catch more-aggressive tumors early. What's more, the researchers said that while breast cancer deaths have fallen since the 1970s, that is mainly due to better treatment — not screening. Welch noted the current study's findings have nothing to do with women who feel a lump in the breast. 'They need to get a mammogram,' he stressed. But, Welch suggested, when it comes to routine screening, women can decide based on their personal values.” Screening as Personal Choice When speaking to NBC news, Welch went on to say that 'screening is a choice. It's not a public health imperative.” 10 At present, most conventional cancer specialists do view mammograms as an imperative, although recommendations vary depending on who you listen to. As of last year, the American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends women of average risk should have their first mammogram at age 45, followed by an annual mammogram up until age 55. Women 55 and older should have them every other year. 11 Meanwhile, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends waiting until the age of 50, and only getting a mammogram every other year thereafter. 12 In response to heated debate over the varying guidelines, the U.S. Congress passed legislation requiring insurance companies to cover mammograms regardless of age. Not surprisingly, the ACS has sharply criticized the latest study. In a statement, chief cancer control officer of ACS, Dr. Richard Wender, said: 'These conclusions are bold, attention-grabbing and should be taken with a grain of salt — actually, an entire spoonful.” The problem with Wender's attitude is that this is by no means the first or only study suggesting that mammography has been vastly oversold. In fact, a number of studies have now refuted the validity of mammography as a primary tool against breast cancer. The Evidence Overwhelmingly Refutes Routine Use of Mammography Other studies that support the findings of the featured study include the following: ✓ Archives of Internal Medicine, 2007 : A meta-analysis of 117 randomized, controlled mammogram trials. Among its findings: Rates of false-positive results are as high as 56 percent after 10 mammograms. 13 ✓ Cochrane Database Review, 2009 : This review found that breast cancer screening led to a 30 percent rate of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, which actually INCREASED the absolute risk of developing cancer by 0.5 percent. The review concluded that for every 2,000 women invited for screening throughout a 10-year period, the life of just one woman was prolonged, while 10 healthy women were treated unnecessarily. 14 ✓ New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), 2010 : This study concluded that the reduction in mortality as a result of mammographic screening was so small as to be nonexistent — a mere 2.4 deaths per 100,000 person-years were spared as a result of the screening. 15 ✓ The Lancet Oncology, 2011 : This study described the natural history of breast cancers detected in the Swedish mammography screening program between 1986 to 1990, involving 650,000 women. Since breast lesions and tumors are aggressively treated and/or removed before they can be determined with any certainty to be a clear and present threat to health, there has been little to no research on what happens when they are left alone. This study however, demonstrated for the first time that women who received the most breast screenings had a HIGHER cumulative incidence of invasive breast cancer over the following six years than the control group who received far less screenings. 16 ✓ The Lancet, 2012 , showed that for every life saved by mammography screening, three women are overdiagnosed and treated with surgery, radiation or chemotherapy for a cancer that might never have given them trouble in their lifetimes. 17 ✓ Cochrane Database Review, 2013 : A review of 10 trials involving more than 600,000 women found mammography screening had no effect on overall mortality. 18 ✓ NEJM, 2014 : Drs. Nikola Biller-Andorno and Peter Jüni published a paper in which they describe the findings of an independent health technology assessment initiative to assess the effectiveness of mammography, of which they were a part: 19 'First, we noticed that the ongoing debate was based on a series of reanalyses of the same, predominantly outdated trials … Could the modest benefit of mammography screening in terms of breast-cancer mortality that was shown in trials initiated between 1963 and 1991 still be detected in a trial conducted today? 
Second, we were struck by how nonobvious it was that the benefits of mammography screening outweighed the harms. 
The relative risk reduction of approximately 20 percent in breast-cancer mortality associated with mammography that is currently described by most expert panels came at the price of a considerable diagnostic cascade, with repeat mammography, subsequent biopsies and overdiagnosis of breast cancers — cancers that would never have become clinically apparent … 
Third, we were disconcerted by the pronounced discrepancy between women's perceptions of the benefits of mammography screening and the benefits to be expected in reality. The figure shows the numbers of 50-year-old women in the United States expected to be alive, to die from breast cancer, or to die from other causes if they are invited to undergo regular mammography every [two] years over a 10-year period, as compared with women who do not undergo mammography … The Swiss Medical Board's report was made public on February 2, 2014. 20 It acknowledged that systematic mammography screening might prevent about one death attributed to breast cancer for every 1,000 women screened, even though there was no evidence to suggest that overall mortality was affected. 
At the same time, it emphasized the harm — in particular, false positive test results and the risk of overdiagnosis … The board therefore recommended that no new systematic mammography screening programs be introduced and that a time limit be placed on existing programs. In addition, it stipulated that the quality of all forms of mammography screening should be evaluated and that clear and balanced information should be provided to women regarding the benefits and harms of screening.” ✓ British Medical Journal (BMJ), 2014 : A Canadian study put the rate of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from mammography at nearly 22 percent. 21 ✓ JAMA Internal Medicine, July 2015 : Here, researchers concluded mammography screenings lead to unnecessary treatments while having virtually no impact on the number of deaths from breast cancer. A positive correlation between breast cancer screening and breast cancer incidence was indeed found, but there was no positive correlation with mortality. 22 , 23 ✓ Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, September 2015 : The conclusion of this study is stated right in the title, which reads: 'Mammography screening is harmful and should be abandoned.” 24 , 25 In short, the authors concluded that decades of routine breast cancer screening using mammograms has done nothing to decrease deaths from breast cancer, while causing more than half (52 percent) of all women undergoing the test to be overdiagnosed and overtreated. According to lead author Peter C. Gøtzsche, had mammograms been a drug, 'it would have been withdrawn from the market long ago.” It's Time to Revise the 'When in Doubt, Cut It Out' Mentality Going back to where we started, even when using the cancer industry's own statistics mammography comes up short, provided you understand what the 20 percent actually means. To reiterate, the difference between getting routine mammograms and not getting them is that the life of 1 in 1,000 women is saved. Four die even with mammograms, compared to five deaths among those who do not get screened. And again, 10 of those 1,000 screened women will be treated for cancer even though they do not actually have it. Clearly the choice is yours. If you find comfort in thinking you may be that one person who is saved, then by all means follow your heart or gut instinct. Just be clear about the risks, because the chances are far greater you could be one of the 10 who ends up undergoing chemo or a mastectomy for a tumor that would not have caused you harm. As noted by Dr. Joann Elmore of the University of Washington School of Medicine: 26 'We get credit for curing disease that never would have harmed the patient. We receive positive feedback from patients thanking us for 'saving my life,' alarming feedback from patients with 'missed diagnoses' and no feedback at all from patients whose cancer was overdiagnosed. The mantras, 'All cancers are life-threatening' and 'When in doubt, cut it out', require revision.” Solid Evidence for Vitamin D as a Cancer Prevention Tool Mammograms are portrayed as the best form of 'prevention” a woman can get. But early diagnosis is not the same as prevention. And when the cancer screening does more harm than good, how can it possibly qualify as your best hope? I believe the evidence really speaks for itself when it comes to mammography. The same can be said for research into vitamin D, which repeatedly shows that optimizing your vitamin D level within a range of 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) provides impressive cancer protection. I believe testing your vitamin D level is one of the most important cancer prevention tests available. Ideally get tested twice a year. There are exceptions, of course. If you feel a lump in your breast, a mammogram may be warranted, although even then there are other non-ionizing alternatives, such as ultrasound, which has been shown to be considerably superior to mammography, especially for dense-breasted women who are at much higher risk of a false negative when using mammography. One of the most recent studies 27 looking at vitamin D for breast cancer found that vitamin D deficiency is associated with cancer progression and metastasis. As noted by Stanford University researcher, Dr. Brian Feldman: 28 'A number of large studies have looked for an association between vitamin D levels and cancer outcomes, and the findings have been mixed. Our study identifies how low levels of vitamin D circulating in the blood may play a mechanistic role in promoting breast cancer growth and metastasis .” Having higher levels of vitamin D has also been linked to increased likelihood of survival after being diagnosed with breast cancer. 29 In one study, breast cancer patients who had an average of 30 ng/ml of vitamin D in their blood had a 50 percent lower mortality rate compared to those who had an average of 17 ng/ml of vitamin D. I am really grateful that the medical community has embraced vitamin D and started using it. However, it's important to understand that the best way to get vitamin D is from sensible sun exposure, and if you're really interested in optimal health and healing you will do everything in your power to get it. This is one of the reasons I moved to Florida. I have not swallowed vitamin D in over 8 years and still have levels over 60 ng/ml. There are many other benefits of sunlight exposure other than vitamin D. Over 40 percent of sunlight is near-infrared rays that your body requires to structure the water in your body and stimulate mitochondrial repair and regeneration. If you merely swallow vitamin D and avoid the sun, you are missing a primary benefit of sensible sun exposure. If you are stuck in the winter and have low vitamin D, it is probably best to swallow oral vitamin D like a drug, but please recognize that this is a FAR inferior way to optimize vitamin D levels and you are missing many important biological benefits when you avoid sun exposure. You can learn more about vitamin D's influence on cancer and other health problems in my previous article, ' The Who, Why and When of Vitamin D Screening .” The fact of the matter is there are many strategies that are far more beneficial in terms of breast cancer prevention than mammography. So if you're hitching your fate on mammograms, you're doing yourself a huge disservice. For key dietary guidelines and lifestyle strategies that can help reduce your cancer risk, please see my previous article, ' Top Tips to Decrease Your Breast Cancer Risk .” Another excellent resource is Dr. Christine Horner's book, 'Waking the Warrior Goddess: Dr. Christine Horner's Program to Protect Against and Fight Breast Cancer ,” which contains scientifically validated all-natural approaches that can protect against and treat breast cancer.

By: The Voice of Reason | We are less than two weeks away from the moment of truth, when the results of the 2016 Presidential election will more than likely be tallied, and we'll have a new President-elect, at least in name anyway, if nothing else. I'll preface this post by saying it's not too late for people to still take as many precautions as possible in hopes of ensuring their families safety not if, but when all hell breaks lose upon the announcement of the election's winner. The media has done their best to conceal it for whatever reason, but there have been ample warnings that there is the potential for massive amounts of violence regardless of who wins. The second video below runs through a laundry list of crimes committed by Hillary Clinton, which has a lot to do with why four in 10 Trump supporters say they won't recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn't have won fair and square. The second video cites specifics, and when you hear them, it's no wonder why former Congressman Joe Walsh called for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, 'On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump . On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. You in?” The former Congressman is hardly alone. A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; and one in five are likely voters are 'VERY concerned,” and they should be. One 69-year old gentleman from Michigan said as the polls began shifting towards Hillary, he slowly began buying more ammunition. If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton's political enemies. Recall that over 70 of them are dead, five of which died in just six weeks under mysterious circumstances during the primaries that Hillary stole from Bernie Sanders. In the first video below, I review warnings issued by both sides of what will happen if the other party's candidate wins. So far, if Hillary wins we have one former Congressman going for his gun, and if Trump wins, we have Black Lives Matter members saying saying back in March: 'Dear white people if Trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go. Just so you know.” That's just the tip of the iceberg… The question posed, 'What would you do,” is primarily directed at Trump supporters if Hillary wins, because the only way she's winning anything, is by fraudulently stealing it, and doing so with Obama's help! How can we make that assertion without any doubt? Starting off light, we know not just from Project Veritas videos released this week , but also from Federal Election Commission (FEC) records, that an activist was caught on camera bragging about having helped start violent disruptions at Donald Trump campaign rallies, and brags that was paid by the Clinton campaign directly right before she stirred up trouble. The Project Veritas videos this week merely confirmed the initial account. We also know that despite Julian Assange saying he did not get information from the Russians, when Trump was beginning to pull away from Hillary in the polls, and Hillary needed a distraction, her and Barack Obama had no problem peddling a baseless accusation against Russia, eventually angering Putin to the point where Russia deployed nuclear missiles into Kaliningrad , along the border with Poland, and aimed them directly at our allies in Berlin. Nukes pointed at our allies? Who cares right? In her mind, 'the ends justify the means.” so long as Hillary wins… Then of course, let's not forget the email that was leaked by Wikileaks that proved that Hillary was not only aware of the transaction, but she allowed weapons to be sold to ISIS during a time of war , weapons that were presumably used against either U.S. troops or American allies at the very least. That act has a name: Treason, and it's punishable by death. Still, the list goes on, including her use of psychological weapons against voters as detailed in one of her internal campaign documents leaked as part of the Podesta emails. In the second video, Alex Jones makes his point very clearly, that there is NO level the Democrats won't stoop to for control of the White House. None. Zero. Furthermore, If by some chance all their fraud isn't enough, and Hillary doesn't win, they plan to burn American cities to the ground. Have you heard of any plans put in place by Obama to stop that? Of course not. Trump supporters: If Hillary is willing to do all those things, and so many more I don't have the time to go into but have all been well documented, just so she can gain entry into Oval Office, what do you think she'll act like once she takes possession of the Office of the President? We know what the Soros funded far-left has planned if Trump wins because they've told us countless times, what about the Trump supporters if Hillary wins? In the video below, Alex Jones asks the question, 'Is there anything, anything at all that Hillary and the Democrats won't do?” The answer to that seems clear. The question then is really whether people think that if Hillary is announced as the winner, is it likely that the American voters will put up with that criminal behavior and just roll over, or is it more likely we're going to see some violence break out?

Truth Bomb from Rasmussen: More Americans Want Hilary Indicted Than Elected! And the list goes on…(Proverbs 24:21; Hebrews 4:13) Now Hillary and the foreign agent in the people's White House, Barack Hussein Obama, are being exposed for voter rigging . Obama has been visited 45 times out of his 340 visits to the White House by election rigging guru and former prison inmate Robert Creamer . The new scapegoat for Obama and Clinton is Russia. They are now being blamed for the crime when it is Clinton and Obama who are literally exposed in their own corruptions. America, do not be diverted from these diplomatic magicians from hell (John 8:44-45). The Clintons have been selling uranium ore to the Russians . This is now World Wrestling Entertainment on a global scale, as they continue to play off of each other. They are not archenemies. They are allied in crime together, period. Furthermore, like that of the Bushes, China, Russia and America, as well as the Pope, they are all calling for the new world. They are allied with the covenant of Hell, which I remind you disannulled (Isaiah 28:15-18). Many are wondering why Hillary Clinton is even up on the platform during debates. It comes to this, the American people have been soft on these corrupt criminals, and have been soft on themselves. However, God will not be soft (Nahum 1:3), and these corrupt individuals have been encouraged to act out in a more corrupt manner. Americans have also allowed the appeasers that identify themselves as prosecutors and government oversight to talk big . Yet, they produce nothing when it comes to justice (Amos 5:7). They are the fox in the chicken coop, acting as if they actually mean what they say. They are protecting themselves as much as the establishment in which they are a part. Then there are those who pose as some sort of patriotic representatives when, in fact, they are the same people that have given Barack a pass every step of the way. These are a few of those who are the establishment: Colin Powell

By: The Voice of Reason | Provided that you are someone who doesn't rely on the mainstream media for anything more than entertainment, and you get your actual 'news” elsewhere, then you already know that, '[T]he Western central banking franchise system is totally broken, totally insolvent, totally corrupt,” and it's been inviting the return of a Gold Standard for some time. More than likely, you also already know that it won't be a United States Gold Standard that global financial system defers to when the U.S. Dollar finally takes it's last gasp of air before dying on the operating table. The entire financial system of the Western banking system and the U.S. Dollar were built upon a debt-based monetary system, and the debt saturation process has run its full course. The days of the U.S. Dollar are numbered, and anyone who has followed the work of Dr. Jim Willie for even a short while, should already know that. However, Because of his sarcastic manner, and the informal atmosphere in which Dr. Willie often conducts his interviews, sometimes it can be difficult to understand (or take seriously), the points he is making. So, for anyone looking to better understand the basis of some of Dr. Willie's more recent forecasts, the article below is written by Dr. Willie himself, and it contains all the details one could ask for that support the positions he has often discussed during many of his most recent prior interviews. The interview is about three weeks old, but it's also his most recent. During the interview, just a few of the topics include how recent geopolitical and economic events have begun to severely fracture NATO, and how post-Brexit the European Commission is becoming largely irrelevant as a governing body. With respect to the death of the U.S. Dollar, Dr. Willie discusses how the Chinese will launch new short term RMB notes backed by gold, causing even more countries to abandon the U.S. Dollar when settling foreign trade debts. Then, to facilitate the U.S. Dollar's transition from the slow precipitous decline we've seen in recent years, into a complete collapse, Dr. Willie explains how we should expect the IMF to soon back it's Special Drawing Rights (SDR'S) with gold, in conjunction with the Saudi's abandoning the PetroDollar for good. Stay tuned at the conclusion of Dr. Willie's technical analysis below, for another good look into the death of the Dollar, in a full-length documentary titled, 'End of An Empire: America Destroyed From Within /Death by Bank-ism.” Dr. Jim Willie Writes: The Western central bank franchise system is totally broken, totally insolvent, and totally corrupt. It invites the Gold Standard return. The entire financial system is built upon a debt-based monetary system. The debt saturation process has run its full course. The central bank heads have been covering the sovereign debt for the last five years, having rendered their balance sheets as ruined. Debt is at obscene levels, like $19.7 trillion for the USGovt. No debt limits are in place anymore, a signal that most likely it has already defaulted. A hidden game is underway, with control lost to the creditors, even as they attempt to salvage their debt holdings. The major central banks continue to manage badly the great game, where money is fake phony and a farce. A titanic battle is underway, where the Eastern nations are discarding their USTreasury Bonds, and doing so in tremendous volume while they set up the many platforms and pieces to the Gold Standard. The US Federal Reserve monetary policy of hyper-inflation has failed to revive the US Economy, failed to legitimize the debt securities, failed to halt the financial corruption, and failed to stem capital destruction. The official monetary policy has only succeeded in preventing the failures of almost all big Western banks. They are all insolvent, mostly supported by narco money laundering in the hundreds of $billions. The Eastern super-powers are leading a campaign to put aside the US$-based financial system, isolate it to the sidelines, while arranging a new system. The Gold-based system will be complete with its currency, sovereign debt securities, transfer systems, global offices, and debt rating agencies, maybe even debit cards. The East strives to install the Gold Standard as the remedy to the ongoing global financial crisis. The West has made exactly no movement toward solution, remedy, or enforcement against bond. Four graphs display the broken unfixable bizarre situation. Graph 1 – BALANCE SHEET DESTRUCTION Central bank balance sheets could take decades to normalize, so the conventional thinking goes. Their balance sheets will never return to normal. Most assets of toxic paper are far more worthless than junk bonds. A normalization process would require at least 50 years of more financial repression and deep corruption. A massive global debt writedown of sovereign bond is coming, on the back end of the Global Financial RESET. Think paradigm shift of the most disruptive type while power shifts eastward. The risk of war rises. The big Western banks find themselves in an impossible Catch-22 situation. The markets are addicted to QE and its destructive money hyper inflation. Federal Reserve policymakers have acknowledged that their $4 trillion balance sheet will not shrink any time soon. Also, Bank of England officials talk of crisis fighting tools as semi-permanent fixtures. In Asia, the Bank of Japan has developed a new monetary policy framework that features admitted infinite QE. The financial crisis the balance sheet volume to GDP ratios for the Bank of England and USFed have peaked at around 25%, the highest level ever recorded. Uncharted territory has been entered. The USFed balance sheet ratio to GDP previously reached 23% in 1940 during World War II. The Bank of England ratio approached 20% in the 1730s during the South Sea Bubble scheme, 1816/17 during the Great Re-coinage, the 1830s/1840s following other wars, and in the immediate aftermath of WW2. In every scenario above, the central banks managed to unwind their balance sheets. But then the great unwinding took decades, up to 60 years in some cases. This time is different. No economic growth is anywhere remotely on the current horizon, nothing sufficient to unwind the tremendous debt burden. This is where the conventional analyst turns stupid, even locked in fantasy. They assume the GDP growth has been around 3% in recent years, when it has been closer to minus 4% or minus 5% each year since 2008 in a fierce recession with strong feedback loops. We are not on the verge of economic expansion, which can relieve the balance sheet toxicity, but rather a financial reform to sweep away the USDollar and to render its USTreasury Bonds as near worthless paper. The next chapter will be centered upon the Gold Standard, first in trade payment, next in bank reserves, finally in currencies.

in: Protestors & Activists , Special Interests , US News Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th? Let's hope that it doesn't happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned 'about the possibility of violence” on election day… A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are 'very concerned.” Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are 'very confident” about that. More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they won't recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn't have won fair and square. But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trump's star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax… Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trump's star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June … This is of course not the first time the GOP candidate's star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trump's star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trump's star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. We have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted 'Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” along with a swastika. There have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece… On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, 'Why can't they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?” Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. 'The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by 'some thugs' that a barmaid called out from the back.” Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a 'Blue Lives Matter” shirt. On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a 'Make America Great Again” baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Let's certainly hope that we don't see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is 'grabbing my musket” if Donald Trump loses the election… Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, 'On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. You in?” And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today … 'Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, I've been buying a lot more ammunition,” says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigan's Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to 'declare martial law and take our guns away” after the election. Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton's political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month … As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it. Submit your review

in: Multimedia , Politics I know the debate was a couple of weeks ago, but I just came across this video that certainly makes a good case for the fact that someone may have been feeding her answers, statistics, and information. If she can't even ad lib a televised debate against Donald Trump, how are negotiations with foreign powers going to go when someone takes away her tablet or other telepromptish device? Not only did Trump win the last debate , he won it without reading the answers and information that someone else was feeding him. Really, with Hillary Clinton, is there any type of dishonesty that seems too far-fetched? See for yourself and let me know in the comments what you think.

By: The Voice of Reason | In recent weeks, a common theme that has run through the vast majority of the stories I've covered, has been for people to make sure they are preparing for the possibility of a major emergency. Why? First and foremost, because it was only back in May when President Obama took time out of his extremely busy schedule to deliver an address at the FEMA National Response Coordination Center in Washington where he made a point to stress that Americans who are not preparing for disaster, or who do not have emergency evacuation plans for any given scenario, could find themselves in big trouble in the near future. The following excerpt from Obama's speech comes directly from the official White House website … 'One of the things that we have learned over the course of the last seven and a half years is that government plays a vital role, but it is every citizen's responsibility to be prepared for a disaster. And that means taking proactive steps, like having an evacuation plan, having a fully stocked disaster supply kit. If your local authorities ask you to evacuate, you have to do it. Don't wait.” That's the biggest reason why. Second, all one has to do is look around at our surroundings to see that right now the 'perfect storm” of pure chaos is brewing all around us. As our allies in Berlin who have nuclear missiles pointed in their direction by the Russians can attest to, Geopolitical tensions are sky right now. German leaders, along with leaders in the Czeck Republic have issued warnings to their people to begin stockpiling food and emergency supplies in case of what could be an 'existence threatening event.” Not helping matters geopolitically is the fact that the entire financial banking system of the West which includes the U.S. Dollar as the World Reserve Currency was built as a debt-based monetary system, and now that the debt saturation process has run its full course, the global economy is on the verge of what is being called a 'global reset,” which could occur at any moment. Lastly, here domestically the 2016 presidential election has gotten so divisive, that supporters from both political parties have vowed not to accept the winner if it's not their candidate, and some groups have even promised the largest civil uprising in our nation's history if the election doesn't go their way. If that was all that was in the news, it would be enough to put anyone on edge. What I talk about in the video below, is a recent article from earlier this week from The Daily Caller . In that article, among other things, it reports that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford has had to issue a reminder/warning to the troops to stay committed to their oaths, as well as the chain of command in the coming weeks. In light of everything I've been warning people of, this recent report is most troubling… The Daily Caller Reports: Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford wrote a Medium blog post Monday to remain committed to its military oath amid the 2016 election. 'What we must collectively guard against is allowing our institution to become politicized, or even perceived as being politicized, by how we conduct ourselves during engagements with the media, the public, or in open or social forums,” Dunford reminded troops. Dunford further urged service members that the military must remain committed to the chain of command structure until the next administration comes in, and that the military should not undermine its credibility in the interim with the next president. 'I have a duty to protect the integrity and political neutrality of our military profession,” he continued. Dunford's comments also come amid increased concern that the U.S. military is becoming too politicized. He is reportedly furious with Retired Marine Gen. John Allen and Retired Army Gen. Michael Flynn for actively campaigning on behalf of the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey openly rebuked Allen and Flynn for injecting themselves into the political process. 'The American people should not wonder where their military leaders draw the line between military advice and political preference,” he lamented in a letter to The Washington Post. He continued 'our nation's soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines should not wonder about the political leanings and motivations of their leaders.” The letter is also likely addressing recent political statements by active duty service members on social media. A female sailor posted a video of herself sitting through morning colors in protest of supposed racism in the national anthem in August. The protest video was inspired by 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. THE VOICE OF REASON is the pen name of Michael DePinto, a graduate of Capital University Law School, and an attorney in Florida.

in: Government , Multimedia , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (© Carlos Barria / Reuters) The FBI has learned of more emails involving Hillary Clinton's private email server while she headed the State Department, FBI Director James Comey told several members of Congress, telling them he is reopening the investigation. 'In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of email that appear to be pertinent” to Clinton's investigation, Comey wrote to the chairs of several relevant congressional committees, adding that he was briefed about the messages on Thursday. 'I agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” 
The FBI director cautioned, however, that the bureau has yet to assess the importance of the material, and that he doesn't know how long that will take. 
The Clinton campaign has yet to comment, but an aide told CNN: 'We're learning about this just like you all are.” 
Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine was asked about Comey's letter while campaigning at an early voting site in Tallahassee, Florida. 'Gotta read a little more, gotta read a little more,” he told reporters. 
Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, praised the decision to reopen the case. 'Now that the FBI has reopened the matter, it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness,”he said in a statement. 'The American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law.” 
Almost 15,000 new Clinton emails were discovered in September, but it's unclear if the announced investigation relates to them or other correspondence. The newly discovered emails are not related to Wikileaks or the Clinton Foundation, law enforcement sources told CNN's Evan Perez. 
The messages were not found on the private email server in the Clintons' New York residence, a government source told Reuters. 
The emails were apparently discovered as part of the sexting probe into former Representative Anthony Weiner (D-New York), the New York Times reported. His electronic devices, as well as those belonging to his wife, senior Clinton aide Huma Abedin, were seized during that investigation. 
House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) renewed his call for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to 'suspend all classified briefings for Secretary Clinton until this matter is fully resolved.” 'Yet again, Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame,” Ryan said in a statement. 'This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators.” Kellyanne Conway, Republican nominee Donald Trump's campaign manager, applauded the decision. 'That is superb. That is extraordinary news for the American people,”she told Yahoo News. 'A great day in our campaign just got even better,” she tweeted. 'They are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States,”Trump said in Manchester, New Hampshire, 10 minutes after learning about the reopening of the case. 'We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.” 'I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made,”he said. 'This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understand, and it is everybody's hope that it is about to be corrected.” 'With that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech?”he joked before turning to his prepared remarks. The 'FBI reopening investigation isn't an October surprise, it's an October nuclear explosion,”conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro wrote as part of a tweetstorm, adding that 'Comey [is] trying to cover his a** 11 days before [the] election”and wondering if a 'pre-emptive impeachment of a president elect”is possible because 'the odds on President Tim Kaine just rose substantially.” An 'October Surprise' is a major event that happens in the month before the election that affects the outcome of the vote. In response to the announcement, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint with the Department of Justice against Comey. 'It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election,” Scott Dworkin, senior advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, said in a statement . 'It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.” Stocks fell after Comey's announcement, CNBC reported.

in: Medical & Health , Multimedia , Natural Medicine , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests Cannabis contains a compound that may kill brain cancers that chemotherapy and radiation can't touch, so why isn't it being used today? In recent years, we've focused heavily on educating our readers about the still relatively unknown role that cancer stem cells play in cancer, both in terms of conventional cancer treatment failure and the exceptionally promising role that natural interventions play in targeting these highly malignant cells. It is encouraging to witness a growing awareness that cancer has been completely misunderstood , and that in order to make progress against the global epidemic we will have to go back to the wisdom of the ancients by using foods and spices instead of toxic chemicals and radiation to fight a disease that should be classified more as a survival mechanism unmasked than an inexorably lethal, genetically-driven condition . Even the National Cancer Institute now admits that it had been wrong for decades about 'early stage” breast ( DCIS ) and prostate (HGPIN) 'cancers,” and that they should be reclassified as indolent or benign lesions of epithelial origin, i.e. not 'cancer” at all! Essentially, therefore, millions were overdiagnosed and overtreated for cancers they never had. Even now, despite this admission, the vast majority of conventional doctors have yet to account for, acknowledge, or integrate this radically different definition of cancer and its implications for treatment into their 'standard of care.” Only last week, we featured a new review on natural therapies that target cancer stem cells , many of which included common foods and spices. You can view it here. But one substance conspicuously absent from the list was cannabis , which is the herb we now turn to to give it a fair representation in the context of this topic. A recent article published in the Journal Neuroimmune Pharmacology titled, ' The Antitumor Activity of Plant-Derived Non-Psychoactive Cannabinoids ,” reviewed the therapeutic potential of a non-psychoactive class of phytochemicals found in cannabis known as cannabinoids . Unlike THC, cannabinoids do not activate the cannabinoid 1 and cannabinoid 2 receptors in the central nervous system in any significant way, making their activity less controversial as they do not produce changes in perception and sensation associated with 'recreational” and/or 'psychedelic” drugs. There are actually over 60 cannabinoids in cannabis, but the second most abundant one, cannabidiol (CBD), has been found to inhibit and/or kill a wide range of cancers in the animal model, including gliobastoma (a difficult-to-treat type of brain cancer), breast, lung, prostate, and colon cancer. There have been a wide range of mechanisms identified behind these observed anti-tumor activities, including anti-angiogenic (preventing new blood vessel formation), anti-metastatic, anti-cell viability, but the one we wish to focus on in this report is its ability to to inhibit the stem-like potential of cancer cells. Stem cells are unique within the body as they are capable of continual self-renewal, theoretically making them immortal relative to regular body cells (somatic cells), which die after a fixed number or replication cycles. In their normal state of function they are essential for healing and bodily regeneration, as they are capable of differentiating into the wide range of cells that make up the body and need to be regularly replaced when damaged. This so-called pluripotent property of stem cells is also observed in tumor formation and maintenance, as cancer stem cells are capable of producing the entire range of different cells that make up a tumor colony. Unlike regular tumor cells, cancer stem cells are uniquely tumorigenic because they are capable of breaking off from an existing lesion or tumor and forming a new tumor colony of cells. In this sense, they are 'mother cells” at the heart of cancer malignancy, whose ability to colonize other tissues by producing all the 'daughter cells” necessary to form a new tumor make their existence highly concerning from the perspective of cancer prevention and treatment. Radiation and chemotherapy, while capable of reducing the size of a tumor, actually enrich the post-treatment residual lesion or tumor with higher levels of cancer stem cells , and in some cases transform non-cancer stem cells into cancer stem cells , ultimately making the post-treatment state of the treated tissue far worse than its pre-treatment condition. This is why identifying and using natural, safe, effective and affordable ways to target cancer stem cells versus the non-tumorigenic tumor cells in a lesion or tumor is the only rational way to treat cancer, and should be the primary focus of present day cancer treatment approaches. The new review discussed the way that cannabidiol targets and/or inhibits the cancer stem cell subpopulation in cancers such as the highly treatment-resistant form of brain cancer known as glioblastoma, which is widely considered by conventional medicine as 'incurable.” A 2013 study, 1 mentioned in the review, found that patient-derived glioblastoma cells when exposed to cannabidiol saw a significant down-regulation of the genetic tumor marker Id-1, which has been closely correlated with brain cancer cell invasiveness. They also found that cannabidiol was capable of inhibiting neurosphere formation (a sign of cancer stem cell tumor formation), as well as was capable of inhibiting glioblastoma tumor invasiveness in an animal model. The results of this preclinical study were so compelling that the researchers concluded cannibidiol might make an ideal adjunct treatment: With its lack of systemic toxicity and psychoactivity, cannabidiol is an ideal candidate agent in this regard and may prove useful in combination with front-line agents for the treatment of patients with aggressive and high-grade glioblastoma tumors. Integrative approaches often focus on using natural interventions as 'adjuncts” to conventional, inherently toxic approaches like chemotherapy and radiation, we believe that another possibility exists, namely, that cannabidiol in combination with a wide range of other natural substances studied for targeting glioblastoma is more effective (and certainly far safer) than a combination approach. To view other anti-glioblastoma substances, view our database on the subject . Another highly relevant study published in 2007 titled, 'Cannabinoids induce glioma stem-like cell differentiation and inhibit gliomagenesis,” 2 found that cannabinoids target the stem-like properties of glioma cells, encouraging their differentiation into functioning, non-tumorigenic cells, and inhibiting the dysregulated increased production of glioma cells. A more recent 2015 study, 3 found that glioblastoma cells treated with cannabidiol inhibited their self-renewal by down-regulating 'critical stem cell maintenance and growth regulators.” Another study, published last month, found that cannabidiol inhibits glioma stem-like proliferation by inducing autophagy, a natural form of programmed cell death. 4 Consider, finally, that the cancer stem cell targeting and killing properties of cannabidiol are only one of a wide range of potential mechanisms through which cannabis as a whole plant, comprised of hundreds of different phytochemicals and phytonutrients, can treat cancer. We have indexed hundreds of studies on cannabis' therapeutic properties, a good subset concerning its ability to prevent, kill, or regress a wide range of different cancer types. You can view them all on our cannabis research database . Research on cannabis and brain cancer has only just begun, but considering the abject failure if not also sheer violence of conventional approaches, waiting for sufficient quantities of Pharma or government capital to flow in the direction of a non-patentable substance already saddled with archaic laws in some cases criminalizing its possession is a no win proposition. Anecdotes of healing with cannabis are not uncommon. One such report can be viewed on our colleague Dr. Jeffrey Dach's website, titled, ' Cannabis Oil Brain Tumor Remission ,” demonstrating just how powerful cannabis and its cannabinoids may be for accomplishing what conventional approaches can not. A couple years ago, we reported on a similar case of temporary remission in childhood leukemia using cannabis extract . Also, consider reports like this one, where a woman clearly being victimized by conventional medicine was able to replace 40 different medications through using raw cannabis juice . The short of it is that the future of medicine , if it is to continue to advertise itself to be concerned with alleviating human suffering and being guided by 'evidence,” must incorporate this safe, time-tested, affordable and effective healing agent into its standard of care. Failing to do so will not de-validate cannabis, rather, but the medical system itself. One might ask, if cannabis can treat 'incurable” brain cancers, and is safer and more effective than chemotherapy and radiation, shouldn't withholding it or information about its healing properties be considered criminal? Instead we still live in a time and age where simply possessing it or using it is in some jurisdictions classified as a criminal offense of dire if not irreparable consequence to our civil liberties. Perhaps we are at a critical turning point now and the aforementioned research will lead us all forward to a more enlightened medical ethos that respects the right of a patient to choose his or her treatment as long as it does no harm to others.

ARTICLE

By: The Voice of Reason | Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. As We the People of the United States prepare for the election of the 45th President of the republic, with each passing day our country is becoming increasingly more polarized, and tensions continue to build between opposing sides. As evidence of the rising tensions, one needs to look no further than some of biggest stories of this past week, stories that were shockingly underreported by a mainstream media just as corrupt and dishonest as those they cover. Arguably the three largest stories of the week have been the Chairman of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff reminding U.S. troops of the oath they took as members of the United States military, and of their required commitment to the chain of command throughout this election season, a former member of Congress calling for an armed revolt if Hillary Clinton wins (alleging there is no way for her to 'legitimately” win without massive fraud), and most recently, the last minute announcement by FBI director James Comey that the FBI has re-opened its investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal, at a time when people are literally inside voting booths casting their early ballots. One major national news story noticeably absent in the non-stop drip of mindless drivel coming from pundits in the mainstream media, is the very real threat of danger due to violence as a result of whoever the eventual election winner turns out to be. Thankfully, on a more local level, various officials appear to be taking the threats posed by both sides more seriously, and several states have now announced that schools will be closed for the election, specifically citing their concern for students' safety from the potential for violence. In the video below, I explain why it's unconscionable that our alleged 'news” outlets would neglect to mention the fact that entire school districts are shutting down out of fear for student safety. We're not talking 'conspiracy theory” here either. We're talking about actual police chiefs recognizing the danger being presented, various state officials recognizing the threats posed, the highest ranking member of our nation's military, and now various school districts all saying the same thing: Danger ahead! If you have children, you might want to look into whether your child's school district has decided to suspend classes yet. If they haven't, don't be surprised when they do. Michael Snyder Writes: Will this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , 'voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere.” Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. Many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News … Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. 'If anybody can sit there and say they don't think this is a contentious election, then they aren't paying much attention,” Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. And without a doubt, voting locations are 'soft targets” that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters … 'There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didn't have 15 or 20 years ago,” said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. ' What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then that's certainly concerning.” All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. Let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. Another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania … 'We don't want to lose an election because you know what I'm talking about,” Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. 'Because you know what? That's a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places .” And of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats… Early voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. Republican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. 'I tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent,” Moynihan said. 'You could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat.” In addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . Well, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation … According to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. The McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation – apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007 – when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? Either way, it doesn't look good. After everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. But Democrats don't like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters… 'It's un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that ,” Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book ' Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America ,” previously told The Christian Science Monitor. 'Voting was very, very dangerous. I don't think anyone's suggesting that we're at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic.” Without a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. But will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? If that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed.

in: Civil Rights , Government , Government Control , Government Corruption , Losing Rights , Tyranny & Police State (image credit: http://www.raul-manzano.com/en/aflags.html) On Thursday, Vladimir Putin asked 'is America a banana republic?” American writer O. Henry (William Sydney Porter) coined the term. It refers to a politically unstable and/or repressive country where a small percent of the population enjoys a disproportionate share of wealth and power. It's where ordinary people are exploited, persecuted, imprisoned, murdered or disappeared for daring to challenge ruthlessly corrupt power responsibly, where profits are privatized while ordinary people bear the burden of high unemployment, impoverishment and loss of fundamental freedoms. It's a kleptocracy run by criminals, complicit with corporate thieves, bribing them to get their way – corrupt, rotten to the core gangsterism, run for personal gain, profiting at the public's expense. Bill and Hillary Clinton, America's most notorious crime family, a Machiavellian duo, are heading back to Washington in January for their third co-presidential term, things rigged to assure it. Their excessive corruption rivals how mafia bosses and drug lords amass wealth – the old-fashioned way by stealing it, selling influence, and other disreputable means. Corruption is endemic virtually everywhere, likely nowhere more excessively than in America, given the nation's enormous public and private wealth, its distribution as disproportionate as in third world countries, special interests grabbing all they can at the expense of most others. Inside the bubble is paradise – outside dystopian hell. America resembles Guatemala, thirdworldized for its privileged few, bipartisan gangsters profiting at the expense of the public they're sworn to serve. Never with Hillary and Bill in charge, addicted to endless wars, predatory capitalism and self-enrichment. WikiLeaks exposed volumes on how they operate. Even the militantly anti-Trump, pro-Hillary Washington Post took note – on October 26 headlining 'Inside 'Bill Clinton Inc.:' Hacked memo reveals intersection of charity and personal income.” Written by top Bill Clinton aide Douglas Band, it explained 'a circle of enrichment,” involving blurred lines between the Clinton Foundation and 'top-tier” corporate clients of his for-profit Teneo Consulting firm. It provided a detailed look at how the Clintons and their top aides operate. It's not pretty. According to WaPo: 'Band's memo provided data showing how much money each of Teneo's 20 clients…had given to the Clinton Foundation, how much they had paid Bill Clinton…” 'Band wrote that Teneo partners had raised in excess of $8 million for the foundation and $3 million in paid speaking fees for Bill Clinton.” 'He said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out $66 million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place.” One observer called the Band memo 'the Rosetta stone of the Teneo-Clinton Foundation complex” – a revenue generating arm for large Foundation donations, along with highly-paid Bill and Hillary speeches, he after leaving the White House, she in 2013 and 2014 after leaving State, before announcing her presidential candidacy. What's coming under their leadership should shock and terrify everyone – policies polar opposite ones Hillary promised on the stump. They'll be broken straightaway once in power, the way GW Bush, Obama and the first Clinton co-presidency betrayed loyal supporters – this time more ruthlessly dangerous than ever. Submit your review

in: NATO , US News , War Propaganda , World News (© Ints Kalnins / Reuters ) (RT) Russia and NATO are to hold separate drills with the Balkan nations of Serbia and Montenegro, both formerly part of Yugoslavia. It comes as the Russian envoy to NATO has warned that the Western alliance's buildup could be harmful for other countries' security. On Monday, 680 personnel from 32 NATO states and partner countries, including Georgia, Albania, Israel and Ukraine, started a series of joint exercises known as Crna Gora (Montenegro) 2016. Between October 31 and November 4, multinational teams will participate in a number of scenarios simulating various disasters such as floods and chemical spills. 'This is an opportunity to work with them [NATO] during the four-day exercise to determine our capacity and the capabilities of our response to natural disasters, as well as to recognize our weaknesses and eliminate them in time,” said Montenegro's Deputy Prime Minister and former intelligence chief Dusko Markovic, as quoted by the newspaper Vijesti. In December, NATO formally invited Montenegro to join the alliance, while in May it has been granted an observer status after accession negotiations. 'Montenegro has demonstrated the ability as a future member of NATO, not only through organizing this exercise, but also bearing its burden,”Markovic added. 'Montenegro has demonstrated the ability to not only willing to accept but also help realize partnership goals.” Meanwhile in Serbia, 150 paratroopers from the reconnaissance battalion of the Ivanovo Airborne Division are to arrive in Belgrade to take part in the military exercise Slavic Brotherhood 2016. The Russian troops will be joined by Serbian and Belarusian forces. The joint Russian-Serbian exercise will last between November 2 and 15, and will also involve over 50 soldiers from the Russian Military Transport Aviation along with combat vehicles including the BMD-2 infantry fighting vehicle, the Tachyon drone and four ATVs for raids and reconnaissance missions. This would mark the second set of Slavic Brotherhood exercises with Serbia, with the first held last year near Novorossiysk. 'Undermining regional security' Russia's Permanent Representative to NATO, Aleksandr Grushko, said on Monday that NATO's buildup close to Russian territory could have a negative impact on the general security situation in the region. 'NATO's [systematic] efforts have been changing the very essence of the military security in the regions which are adjacent to the Russian border,” Grushko said in an interview to Rossiya-24 channel which aired on Monday. 'This seriously worsens the regional security and the security of those countries that participate in these drills and this activity,”he said, adding that NATO's ongoing military buildup in its eastern flank is 'some sort of project that not only does not correspond to the common European security interests, but goes against them.” Reflecting on the earlier statements by NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who said on Thursday that NATO did not want to get caught up in a new Cold War with Russia, Grushko pointed out that NATO has been sending mixed signals on purpose in a bid to justify its military buildup. 'I think it's a double signal. First of all, it's a signal to western public opinion that all NATO actions on its eastern flank are calibrated and do not transcend the framework of reasonable defense. Secondly, it's also an apparent attempt to send a signal to us, so that Russia will not react in what they believe to be an excessive and aggressive manner,”he said, adding: 'In effect,”NATO's increased military activity close to Russian borders is 'justified by nothing.” While Stoltenberg claimed that NATO aims 'to strive for a more cooperative and constructive relationship” with Russia, in reality the alliance does not seem to maintain this approach, as evidenced by its recent refusal to discuss flight security in the Baltic Sea region, the Russian diplomat said. 'The very fact that NATO's countries refused to convene for the meeting, proposed by us and to be held at the level of military experts in Moscow and devoted to all aspects of air traffic security in this region, speaks volumes,” Grushko said, adding that NATO may not be that genuine in its attempt to improve air traffic security over the Baltic Sea. In July, Russia's Defense Ministry said that Russia is ready to fly all its missions over the Baltic Sea with the transponders on, but only if NATO member states reciprocate. 'As soon as we said about this, the issue of transponders practically disappeared from NATO member states' political lexicon. It ceased to exist… I'm not sure that NATO is sincerely ready to talk about joining such a regime,”he concluded.

in: Government , Government Corruption , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests , US News According to a report in the New Yorker, James Comey, Big Kahuna of the FBI, went full-on cowboy in releasing details of the new Clinton email inquiry. Apparently, the Department of Justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election. Gosh. I wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was Donald Trump who was being investigated by the FBI. Comey explained his decision in a letter to FBI employees : 'We don't ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed. I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.” The DoJ – and by DoJ I mean Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with Bill Clinton to talk about her non-existent grandchildren – is implying that Comey is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election. Here's Comey's letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee: (click image to enlarge) Really? The DoJ thinks that the public shouldn't know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the FBI? That's the most absurd thing I have heard for quite some time, and considering this election, that's really saying something. This is from the New Yorker report, emphasis mine. On Friday, James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, acting independently of Attorney General Loretta Lynch , sent a letter to Congress saying that the F.B.I. had discovered e-mails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of Hillary Clinton's private server. Coming less than two weeks before the Presidential election, Comey's decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about Clinton was contrary to the views of the Attorney General, according to a well-informed Administration official. Lynch expressed her preference that Comey follow the department's longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations, and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election, but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise . Comey's decision is a striking break with the policies of the Department of Justice, according to current and former federal legal officials. Comey, who is a Republican appointee of President Obama, has a reputation for integrity and independence, but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities, who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the Presidential and congressional elections. ( source ) Is this investigation the iceberg to HRC's Titanic campaign? Hillary Clinton has said she finds the development 'unprecedented and deeply troubling.” (source ) Oh, I'll bet she does. I'll bet if Trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage, gripping the podium to stay upright, saying how wonderful it was that Comey decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws. I'll bet she'd be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation. I'll bet she'd take the high road and say that those elected to the office of President of the United States have to be above and beyond reproach. Of course, when it's her, things are a little different, aren't they? We do have a right to know. We absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets. It seems like a no-brainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her. And the fact that we know has severely damaged Clinton's campaign. Although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake , it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls. A poll from ABC news and the Washington Post , both hotbeds of liberal voters, has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over Donald Trump due to the Clinton email scandal. 'About a third of likely voters say they're less likely to support Clinton given FBI Director James Comey's disclosure Friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state. ' Finally, some people are actually paying attention to the character of Hillary Clinton. But it may not be enough. There was one finding that was astonishing to me, even though it probably shouldn't be: 'Given other considerations, 63 percent say it makes no difference.” Meanwhile, on social media, the FBI emails are somehow not a trending topic. It certainly appears that Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and Buzzfeed are blacking out the topic. My biggest question is this: Why now? Why did James Comey, who has probably committed career suicide, along with a potential actual 'suicide” via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the Clintons, feel the need to break the news, particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation? Opponents will jump on the fact that he's a Republican and will say that he did it for political reasons. They won't admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the Clinton email negligence. They will never, ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that, perhaps, when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong, he took it. Clinton isn't taking it gracefully. Clinton's complaints, which have appeared in the press around the world, make her look even worse than she did before. This is from The Telegraph , a UK publication: Hillary Clinton was furiously fighting to keep her Presidential bid on track on Saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed, after the FBI's bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails. James Comey announced on Friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether Mrs Clinton was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material. On Saturday, the latest poll of polls by tracker site RealClearPolitics put Clinton 3.9 percentage points ahead of the Republican nationwide, down from 7.1 points just 10 days previously. But wait – it gets better: The Clinton campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against Mr Comey, alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive. And Mrs Clinton herself called the decision 'unprecedented” and 'deeply troubling”. 'It's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election,” she complained, addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the must-win state of Florida. Democrats questioned the timing of the agency's decision, which comes as polls showed Mrs Clinton's lead falling just 10 days before the presidential election. 'This is like an 18-wheeler smacking into us, and it just becomes a huge distraction at the worst possible time,” said Donna Brazile, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. 'The campaign is trying to cut through the noise as best it can. 'We don't want it to knock us off our game. But on the second-to-last weekend of the race, we find ourselves having to tell voters, 'Keep your focus, keep your eyes on the prize.'” Hillary's campaign manager sounds pretty desperate to me. As for the complaints from HRC, they just make her sound like the out-of-touch, money-grabbing, power-hungry, deceitful

in: Special Interests , US News The new year is almost here and it's often a time when we all start to think about what we want to change for the next year. I've never been much a fan of the whole cliche of changing because of the new year, but why not embrace it as a time where we can make change? Do a quick reflection right now. Do you feel like you have followed your dreams and passions this past year? Do you feel you got caught up in the stresses of life quite often? Did you feel judgement, negative self talk and anger were a big part of your days? Reflecting on how you've felt over your year and being honest with yourself about it gives you the chance to know how to adjust and move forward from this moment forward whether it be the new year or not. I've found in my own life that if I don't pay attention to how I feel, what I create, what's playing out in my life and take responsibility for it, it doesn't change. It stays the same, I experience the same emotions or stagnant feelings, and I don't move forward. But the moment I decide to take it into my own hands, I see how much I'm not a victim to what happens. 11 Things To Let Go of Before the New year 1. Stop all the negative self talk – It's first because it's probably one of the most important. The more we talk poorly about ourselves to ourselves or others, the more we disempower ourselves and empower all the things we wish to adjust about ourselves. Observe it, take note of it, and kick it. It's not helping you. 2. Choose one bad eating habit and kick it! – Taking care of and fuelling your vessel is one of the most important things we can do in life to stay mentally, emotionally and spiritually healthy. Pick one of your worst eating habits and aim to cut it out completely in 3 months. Whatever it might be, be honest with yourself and make it happen. Then take on the next bad eating habit in 3 months. 3. Let go of chasing 'success' – So often we put up goals or plans for ourselves yet have this tiny limited scope of what success is. Next thing you know we bring stress, worry and fear into the equation throughout the whole journey because we may not be totally in line to hit this pin prick point of what success looks like to us. Instead, do your best to take the steps needed to get to where you want to go, but let go of the lure of success and what it looks like and means. There's no such thing as failure. (more) 4. Kick the idea that you cannot achieve or follow your dreams – So often we have our ideas of what we are excited or passionate about, but let it go because we think we can't do it or because it's unrealistic. Instead of believing every word of that, take ONE step. One step towards making your passion or your dreams happen. The one step will lead to the next and the next, but you have to take the first one. Plan out that first step and take it! 5. Let go of the idea that you should run from your problems – We often get into this mentality that we just need to 'get over it.” In theory this sounds sorta good, you move on from things that happen in the past or something to that effect. But by just forgetting about it, did we really move on? No, it gets triggered again later or lies dormant as a resented event etc. Instead, let's face our problems and truly move past them. Journal about it, talk to someone else about it. Put the cards on the table to someone who cares about you and who can help you move past it. Pick someone who will see the bigger picture and be honest with you. You have all it takes to move past what challenges you. 6. Stop comparing yourself to others – This is a big one. So often we are looking at others and using what they have, do or are to compare it against us and make up a story. This whole game can make us sad or feel down about ourselves or it can feed our ego in a big way. Let it go, respect everyone's journey, including your own and stop the need to compare yourself to others. 7. Stop judging others – Judging other people can become a habit and an addiction. It's like something we can't stop doing sometimes! Take a moment the next time you judge someone and observe it. Ask yourself why you did it, how did it make you feel? Etc. Make a conscious effort to stop. (more) 8. Stop the blame game – Blaming and pointing fingers when it comes to our challenges or what happens to us doesn't allow us to look at and observe how we might have created or aligned with an experience to help make it happen. I'm not saying there's no such things others can do to hurt you, I'm simply saying take responsibility for how you feel and don't even point blame, it doesn't help us. 9. Stop worrying and trying so hard to fit in and be accepted – This is something far too many of us do just to save face and not be 'the weird one.” The reality is, it's more 'weird' to be a version of yourself that isn't genuine or real simply because you want to be accepted by others. It's a choice you can't maintain forever and the longer it goes the more uncomfortable you will feel. Be you, accept yourself, be genuine and don't try to make others do the same when. Let it happen. Trust. 10. Let go of the need to control everything – Sometimes we can't take a step forward in anything because we don't know all the answers or all the variables. This is our obsession with control sometimes. Yes, observe a situation and make the best choices available to you, but don't worry so much about needing to control or know every detail about it. Learn to leave things up to trust and knowing that things will work out as they need to. This doesn't mean be reckless, just that you don't need to control every thing, person and detail. 11. Stop procrastinating – This one goes with everything on the list. Stop putting it all off. Whatever it may be. The changes listed above, the hobby you want to, the career you want to explore, or the thing you want to tell to someone important to you. Stop putting it off and just do it! Submit your review

Garrison also discusses his struggle with online trolls over the past several years, the broader war on free speech and political dissent, and how such phenomena are illustrated in the defamatory campaign against Canadian Professor Anthony Hall in October 2016 that led to the academic's suspension from his university earlier this month. In a sea of homogeneity Ben Garrison's trailblazing work offers a truly unique perspective on political and economic concerns. A longtime professional painter and freelance graphic artist, his first cartoons appeared in The San Angelo Standard Times in the early 1980s. Garrison has since been a graphic artist at the The San Antonio Express News and The Seattle Post-Intelligencer . In 2008 the big banks were bailed out, which served as Garrison's wake-up call. The bailout marked the point where he felt he had to do something. Using his graphic art skills he wanted to ring alarm bells and so he became a citizen muckraker. CLICK HERE TO LISTEN In 2009 Garrison began drawing editorial cartoons that skewered the Federal Reserve and the growing police state in America. The Internet made it possible for his cartoons to be seen by millions all over the world. The Internet also made it possible for anonymous entities to deface his work, libel his name and make him into the most trolled cartoonist in the world. Garrison's wife Tina Garrison is also a cartoonist and in 2010 they began the web site ' grrr.graphics.com .” It features a growling bulldog named 'GRRR” who takes a bite out of tyranny. Their dog is doing the job as watchdog that the mainstream media now seems reluctant to do.

in: Government , Government Corruption , Obama Exposed , Sleuth Journal Just when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a gamechanger into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails 'did not come from her private server”, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the 'emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry”, and according to some reports there may be 'potentially thousands” of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? Let's take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN … After recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that 'appear to be pertinent” to the email probe. 'In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,” Comey wrote the chairmen. 'I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” At this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton's closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton's Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered … We don't know what this means yet except that it's a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that's where we are… Is it a certainty that we won't learn before the election? I'm not sure it's a certainty we won't learn before the election. One thing is, it's possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her… If the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? It is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. So those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. But if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason… If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year's primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members – a number that changes over time and is guided by the group's bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. It would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. In such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be 'fair” until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. Meanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. And CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November… An artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. Without Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. So if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. At this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.

in: War Propaganda , World News (© Omar Sanadiki / Reuters) They've done it before without causing casualties or damage. According the Russian Foreign Ministry, terrorists fired two mortar rounds at the embassy's compound. One shell exploded near the diplomatic mission's entrance, damaging the building and four vehicles. The attack came from terrorist-controlled Jobar district. On Friday, the Security Council addressed the incident, saying its 'members…condemned in the strongest terms another mortar shelling of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Damascus (Syrian Arab Republic), which caused significant material damage.” They stressed the 'fundamental principle of the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises.” Host governments are obligated 'to take all appropriate steps to protect diplomatic and consular premises against any intrusion or damage, and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of these missions or impairment of their dignity, and to prevent any attack on diplomatic premises, agents and consular officers.” Not easily done when countries are attacked by foreign-supported death squads, supplied with heavy weapons to wage war. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova expressed concern over no 'international reaction…but we will try to get it,” she said, including on the platform of international organizations, because we are talking about a diplomatic mission, about systematic terrorist attacks.” Russian upper house Federation Council Security and Defense Committee first deputy chairman Frants Klintesevich believes the latest shelling was conducted to disrupt Moscow's humanitarian pause, saying it failed – nor can there be an 'option of making any concessions to terrorists.” Separately, heavily US-led Western pressure got General Assembly members to vote Russia off the UN Human Rights Council – a body infested with major human rights abusers, including reelected member Saudi Arabia with over a three-fourths majority vote. Ignored was its genocidal war on Yemen, ruthless despotic rule tolerating no dissent, arbitrary arrests and imprisonments, torture and physical abuse, public beheadings and whippings, violence against women, along with other major violations of civil and human rights. Russia, Hungary and Croatia vied for two Eastern European seats. Moscow's UN envoy Vitaly Churkin said '(i)t was a very close vote and very good countries competing, Croatia, Hungary. They are fortunate because of their size, they are not exposed to the winds of international diplomacy. Russia is very exposed. We've been in the UNHRC for several years, and I am sure next time we will stand and get back in.” Not easily as long as Washington maintains pressure to prevent it. US-led NATO's undeclared war on Russia continues. Hillary's ascension to power next year threatens to turn it red hot. Submit your review

Remember the last debate when the internet blew up because Donald Trump said he wouldn't necessarily accept the results of the election ? People were bemoaning him as a fascist and no one in the mainstream wanted to admit that our election process is entirely rigged. The trouble is, voter fraud on a grand scale can be tough to prove . As it turns out, voter fraud on a smaller scale has been detected in 6 locations already, according to today's Drudge Report . But don't worry. These are just 'glitches” or 'too few to make a difference.” 1) Chicago In the Windy City, the dead have been voting for decades. Two investigators have admitted finding proof of this, but they refuse to say that there is fraud. Relatives of the Voting Dead feel differently. They say that they've reported the deaths of their loved ones repeatedly, but that the names have not been removed from the rolls. But that isn't the worst of it – not only are these people on the rolls – they've repeatedly voted since their deaths. Don't worry, though. It's just a few hundred dead voters that they've been able to confirm. No biggie. ( source ) 2) Philadelphia Chicago is not alone with the dead folks voting.There are also reports from Philadelphia that people are making their voices heard from beyond the grave. *cough* Local station Action News 6 investigated and found that a stunning number of people have been deemed 'active voters” for many years since their deaths. Don't worry, though. The local voting board says these mistakes are simply 'human error” and that there aren't enough dead voters to actually sway the election. ( source ) 3) Hollywood, Maryland A woman in Maryland has reported another incidence of 'vote flipping.” She voted a straight Republican ticket, then checked after it was submitted. Her vote for Trump had been switched to a vote for Clinton. Don't worry, though. The election officials there told her to just vote again. Of course, this would 'undo” the vote for Clinton, but would it really count as a vote for Trump? I'm sure it's fine. The election officials would want to be scrupulous about something like that. ( source ) 4) Miami-Dade County, Florida Two women have been charged with felony counts of tampering with the election. One, a temporary election worker, was caught marking ballots by her co-workers. The other was caught filling out voter registration paperwork for people who did not exist. Don't worry, though. These were isolated incidents that have been dealt with. In the words of State Attorney Katherine Fernández Rundle, a Democrat, 'Anyone who attempts to undermine the democratic process should recognize that there is an enforcement partnership between the elections department and our prosecution task force in place to thwart such efforts and arrest those involved. Now we need to move forward with the election.” ( source ) 5) Alexandria, Virginia A guy in Virginia who was formerly employed by the New Virginia Majority, an advocacy group aligned with the Democratic party, was caught using fake names to fill out voter registration applications. But don't worry. Commonwealth Attorney Bryan Porter said, 'Since the fraudulent applications involved fictitious people, had the fraud not been uncovered the risk of actual fraudulent votes being cast was low.” ( source ) 6) Lots of places in Texas Much like the report in Maryland, voters in various locations in Texas have reported that when they chose a straight Republican ticket, the voting machines opted for Clinton/Kaine instead of Trump/Pence. Voters in Amarillo, Arlington, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Cypress, Mesquite, and El Paso have all reported vote flipping from Trump to Clinton. But don't worry. Election officials in the state say it's not a problem with the equipment. It's just those silly voters who don't know how to use it. ''Typically, we've found it's voter error with the equipment. Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates … or do something with the wheel….There is not an issue with the equipment.” ( source ) If you're worried about election fraud… You can add a smartphone app by True the Vote called VoteStand to report incidents of fraud. Don't let anything slide. If you are voting, make sure your choice is accurately recorded. Article first posted at DaisyLuther.com Submit your review

From that region, the fruit of the coconut palm is believed to have been brought to India and then to East Africa. After the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, this plant was introduced into West Africa and, from there, dispersed to the American continent and to other tropical regions of the globe.” The review also summarized the traditional healing applications of the coconut palm. This is an important, complementary data set, because though many of the traditional uses have not yet been tested and validated by science, they may actually work exceptionally well for these conditions in actual practice. The traditional uses were also summarized in the following paragraph: In Brazil, extract from the husk fiber of C. nucifera is used to treat diarrhea (7). In Papua New Guinea, the leaves and roots of young plants are chewed as treatment for diarrhea and stomachaches (8,9). In Fiji, coconut oil is used to prevent hair loss and coconut water is used to treat renal disease (10). In Ghana, people use coconut milk to treat diarrhea (11). In Guatemala, the husk fiber extract is used as an antipyretic, to reduce renal inflammation, and as a topic ointment for dermatitis, abscesses, and injuries (12). In Haiti, a decoction of the dry pericarp is used for oral treatment of amenorrhea, and the oil is applied as an ointment to burns (13); an aqueous extract from the husk fiber is also used for oral asthma treatment (14). In India, infusions made with the coconut inflorescence are used for the oral treatment of menstrual cycle disorders (15). In Indonesia, the oil is used as a wound ointment, the coconut milk is used as an oral contraceptive, and fever and diarrhea are treated with the root extract (16–18). In Jamaica, the husk fiber extract is used to treat diabetes (19,20). In Mozambique, the fruit is consumed by men as an aphrodisiac (21). Peruvians use the aqueous extract of the fresh coconut fiber orally for asthma, as a diuretic, and for gonorrhea (22). In Trinidad, bark extract is used orally for amenorrhea and dysmenorrhea, and bark tea is used to treat venereal diseases (23). In Mexico, coconut is used to treat various disorders associated with urogenital tract infection by Trichomonas vaginalis (24). A decoction of the white flesh of the fruit is used in rural Malaysia to treat fever and malaria (25). In Kenya, the fruit is used to relieve skin rash caused by HIV infection (26). The study concluded, Cocos nucifera is a widely dispersed plant that has important pharmacological effects with low toxicity. Furthermore, medicinal use of C. nucifera has an environmental appeal, since this plant is widely used in the food industry and use of discarded plant parts will reduce waste and pollution. The pharmacological effects of the plant differ according to the part of the plant or fruit used. Antioxidant activity predominated in the constituents of the endocarp and coconut water. In addition, the fiber showed antibacterial, antiparasitic, and anti-inflammatory activities. Only the ethanolic extract of the root had depressant and anticonvulsant action on the central nervous system. Coconut water seems to have protective effects, e.g., on the kidney and heart, and antioxidant activity, as well as a hypoglycemic effect.

in: General Health , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests Taking calcium supplements — even at low doses — linked to brain lesions in the first study of its kind. Most calcium supplements are just plain bad news. The idea of taking calcium in pill or tablet form to 'keep the bones strong” just doesn't make that much sense given, first, that we are designed to get our calcium from food. Second, our bone is a living tissue, which requires vitamin C, amino acids, magnesium, silica, vitamins D and K, etc., not to mention regular physical activity, just as much as it does calcium. Taking calcium to the exclusion of these other critical factors doesn't make sense; nor does it make sense to look at osteoporosis as a deficiency of calcium supplements! As we have reported on extensively in the past, not only is consuming limestone, bone, and the shells of oysters and eggs not a good idea because the calcium can deposit in our soft tissues leading to heart attacks and strokes , but even the goal of maintaining bones as dense as a 25-year old late into life (known as the T-score) is fraught with danger, including a far higher breast cancer risk for those with the highest bone density . Instead of pathologizing aging, and focusing on making the bone denser by any means necessary, the focus should be on bone quality and agility and bodily self-awareness late into life, which helps the elderly prevent the falls that lead to fracture in the first place. In other words, simply having a gait or vision disorder can be at least as an important factor in fracture risk as bone mineral density. The problem with poor quality, inorganic, calcium supplements, however, does not stop with their contribution to cardiovascular disease risk. A combination of factors including low magnesium, vitamin K2 and the presence of fluoride in the water and diet can lead to pineal gland calcification , as well as the calcification of other brain structures, which recently has been hypothesized to be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease . (click image to enlarge) A truly provocative study on this topic published last year in the British Journal of Nutrition somehow slipped through the cracks, because not only did we miss it but we do not recall it being reported elsewhere. Titled, ' Elevated brain lesion volumes in older adults who use calcium supplements: a cross-sectional clinical observational study ,” the study looked at the possibility that since calcium supplements have now been linked in multiple studies with vascular pathologies associated with cardiovascular diseas they may also be associated with the occurrence of brain lesions (known on MRI scans as hyperintensities) in older adults. These brain lesions, visible as brighter spots in MRI scans, are known to be caused by lack of blood flow (ischemia) and subsequent neurological damage. According to the study, 'Brain lesions,also known as hyperintensities, are areas of damage observed on brain MRI ( See Above ). These lesions are common in older adults and increase the risk of devastating health outcomes, including depression, cognitive decline, dementia, stroke, physical disability, hip fracture and death. Postmortem studies have determined that these lesions form primarily due to ischemia, especially larger lesions (.3mm) and lesions found in depressed individuals.” The observational study enrolled 227 older adults (60 years above) and assessed food and supplemental calcium intakes. Participants with supplemental calcium use above zero were categorized as supplement users. Lesion volumes were assessed with MRI scans. Key findings were: Greater lesion volumes were found among calcium supplement users than non-users The influence of calcium supplements was of a magnitude similar to that of the influence of high blood pressure (hypertension), 'a well-established risk factor for lesions.” The study found that the amount of calcium used was not associated with lesion volume and that 'even low-dose supplements, by older adults may be associated with greater lesion volumes.” Even after controlling for food calcium intake, age, sex, race, years of education, energy intake, depression and hypertension, the association between calcium supplement and lesion volumes held strong. The study details were summarized as follows: 'In the present cross-sectional clinical observational study, the association between Ca-containing dietary supplement use and lesion volumes was investigated in a sample of 227 older adults (60 years and above). Food and supplemental Ca intakes were assessed with the Block 1998 FFQ; participants with supplemental Ca intake above zero were categorised as supplement users. Lesion volumes were determined from cranial MRI (1.5 tesla) scans using a semi-automated technique; volumes were log-transformed because they were non-normal. ANCOVA models revealed that supplement users had greater lesion volumes than non-users, even after controlling for food Ca intake, age, sex, race, years of education, energy intake, depression and hypertension (Ca supplement use: β = 0.34, SE 0.10, F(1,217)= 10.98, P= 0.0011). The influence of supplemental Ca use on lesion volume was of a magnitude similar to that of the influence of hypertension, a well-established risk factor for lesions. Among the supplement users, the amount of supplemental Ca was not associated with lesion volume (β = – 0.000035, SE 0.00 015, F(1,139)= 0.06, P= 0.81). The present study demonstrates that the use of Ca-containing dietary supplements, even low-dose supplements, by older adults may be associated with greater lesion volumes. Evaluation of randomised controlled trials is warranted to determine whether this relationship is a causal one.” What is the mechanism beneath this association? The researchers discussed the already established link between calcium supplementation and increased ischemic stroke risk, indicating that calcium supplementation may contribute to calcium deposits in the vasculature (i.e. arterial calcification), mainly in the fatty deposits (atheromas) that contribute to blocking the opening (lumen) of the blood vessels. They state that this process can lead to lack of blood flow and subsequent oxygen deprivation (ischemia), ultimately leading to the development of brain lesions. Another mechanism by which excess calcium may have a direct neurotoxic effect on the brain is the influx of excess calcium into brain cells, which lead to cell death. This possibility is greatly increased if the blood-brain barrier is compromised. The researchers also highlighted the importance of the finding that calcium supplementation may have as significant a deleterious effect on brain lesions as high blood pressure (hypertension): 'If this finding is confirmed in longitudinal studies, it could have important health implications – because it is obviously much easier to cease Ca supplement use than to medically manage hypertension.” In other words, hypertension is often caused by toxic antihypertensive drugs that may actually increase the risk of cardiac mortality . Why not remove one of the modifiable causes: calcium supplementation, which would strike to one of the root causes of the problem and resolve it. The researchers concluded their study as follows: 'The use of Ca [calcium] -containing dietary supplements by older adults was found to be associated with greater brain lesion volumes, even after controlling for the usual amount of dietary Ca intake. Interestingly, neither the amount of supplemental Ca nor the duration of supplemental Ca use was associated with lesion volume. These findings indicate that adverse biochemical effects of supplemental Ca use may exist in older adults, regardless of the dose.” So, what do we do instead of taking calcium supplements? First, consider why you think you need calcium supplements. Is it because of the dairy industry promoting for decades the concept that we need calcium (from milk)? Or, is it because your doctor is throwing around terms like osteopenia and osteoporosis carelessly, without explaining to you that the present day bone mineral density (BMD) reference ranges assume that aging is a disease and even if you are 60 or 100 for that matter you are still supposed to have the BMD of a 25-year old young woman; an absurd and dangerous idea. Please read the expose, ' Osteoporosis Myth: The Dangers of High Bone Mineral Density ,” in order to understand how millions of healthy women were made to believe that aging is a disease, with worse health outcomes as a result of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Now, when it comes to calcium, focus on food sources. The site NutritionData.com lists about 1,000 of the highest calcium-containing foods, categorized by food group: Foods highest in Calcium . Also, remember that the accelerated bone loss that occurs later in life in women, is triggered by hormonal changes associated with the exhaustion of the ovarian reserve. Nature, however, provides ‘back up' support for the ovaries in the form of pomegranate . Other hormone-modulating foods include the fermented soy food miso , prunes , and even vitamin C , which has recently been found to regenerate steroid hormones .

in: Consciousness , Sleuth Journal , Society , Special Interests , US News With the long awaited controversial US presidential election day inching closer and as the Hillary ship threatens to sink with every passing day and every new revelation , here is a question all truth seekers should ponder. What if after all is said and done a frightening and shocking Hillary declared 'victory” is the very thing required in this human consciousness journey we call life in order to truly trigger mass awakening above and beyond the awakening to political corruption we have now? This scenario is very plausible given the nature of our political system and the now normalized very intense propaganda that is being displayed today by the mainstream media , Hollywood and the many Soros funded non-profit political organizations involved in this presidential race like Moveon.org whose job it is to keep feeding their followers the lies, deceit and propaganda using celebrity voices (see shocking image below) equating a Hillary vote as a show of 'love”. And since this scenario (of mass awakening and mass action) is now very plausible, perhaps everyone who cares about individual rights and America should pay attention to the events that are about to unfold. Bear with me as we imagine we are all standing in front of the large screen that offers all the answers to life. On this screen we have the privilege of seeing with our own eyes and ears the journey our species has been through. This presentation thus acts as an instructional manual for us (humanity, truth seekers) to use as an instructional guide. Imagine that on this movie screen we can easily look for patterns in previous human behaviors, analyze cause and effect and see how governments and the ruling elite do their tricks on the masses to ensure their control over us. Imagine how easy life would be if we had a screen to show us all the answers. Imagine being able to see these easily observed patterns on the video screen and their immediate effects on the species. This front row view into the journey of humanity would not only be instructional for those observing, it would be the primary instructional guide by which we would be able to make rather safe, high probability, minimal risk decisions on current political situations. Well guess what? We have that screen available to us. It's called the documented account of history. Ancient history as well as modern history is available to us in today's information age. We have now reached a point where very little is hidden. The occult ruling elite are now fully exposed for who they are, for their devious and deceitful tactics on the masses and their criminal plans for dominating humanity one overthrown nation state at a time with limitless eternal unchecked power. The official birth of this historic moment will be embodied in a Hillary Clinton 'victory” selection which could very well take place very soon here in the US. The thing that everyone must recognize is that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. In fact, the ruling elite know this very well. This is why they have armed themselves to the teeth with military weaponry including 1.6 billion (yes billion!) rounds of hollow point bullets, militarized DHS and FEMA camps. This is the true reason for the police state, the race toward AI technology, the surveillance state, the deployment of the JADE AI based conventional asymmetric warfare software and the in-your-face criminality, lies and deceit of the Hillary-mainstream media-Hollywood team. They're acting like bullies who can taste the new world order because they know it's so close to them at this point. THIS is where we are today and all truth seekers, Bernie supporters, Trump supporters and anyone else who has felt the sting of this new world order operation known as the Hillary campaign needs to acknowledge this reality now. I could be wrong about this but I highly suspect that this point in history will prove to be the last stand or should I say the last meaningful opportunity for people to wake up at a mass scale to what is happening both globally and domestically. The movie screen I was talking about before is real. We have it playing before us. Again, it's called history. Today more than ever any idiot can easily verify that the US has thousands of military bases around the world. You can easily verify that today the US empire rules the world, that the 9/11 operation was an activation of their PNAC plans and final global takeover. You can easily verify how the US and it's CIA , economic terrorists and 'special forces” has strong-armed almost every nation on earth to exert its domination on it and insert its own puppet president. You can easily look up at the screen of history and see how the enslavement of humanity was planned long ago with a process of mass propaganda, consumerism, mass medication, mass entertainment and brainwashing and mass indoctrination via the board of education. There are of course far too many moving parts to this new world order plan to list here but you get the picture, it was all planned out to lead us to where we are today. Understanding and seeing this easily available information we've considered so far then allows us to see the next phase of where we are heading. Frankly, this next phase I wholeheartedly believe will be exponentially accelerated with a Hillary Clinton declared 'victory” on November 8th 2016. I say 'victory” because I believe that without interference by the ruling elite (DNC, mainstream media, DHS etc) Donald Trump would win by a landslide. Hopefully I'm wrong but I suspect there is little chance if any of the TRUE results holding up. The ruling elite simply didn't come this far to let the people actually have a say in who wins. With that said, I call on all truth seekers and everyone else who is hoping to see Hillary Clinton go away forever to hold still and realize that this upcoming moment in history may actually be the moment of truth for humanity. Realize that throughout history (the movie screen we talked about earlier) we see that all major events in human history are associated with major realizations and major emotional pivotal points of absolute conviction and purpose. This point of absolute conviction and purpose is here. We all see the blatant criminality being waved in all our faces. We know who they (the ruling elite) are. We are all salivating in some way to see them go down by being arrested, imprisoned, punished, exposed, embarrassed and cast from our society. Before you target a criminal you have to identify who they are. Today humanity can celebrate one of several major accomplishments. One of them being that we have come a long way at actually exposing and identifying who these criminals are. Today we know their names, we have entire databases and factual findings confirming the criminality of all of these people from the ones at the very top of the power structure all the way down to the scum bag crisis actors like the Sandy Hook criminals (Gene Rosen, Lenny Pozner etc) and others. The hard reality today is that a Hillary 'victory” more than any other scenario will mobilize people to take action to take back their country. Naturally the criminal Left, the DNC and the Hillary-mainstream media complex would LOVE to stage some kind of violent act to blame on the possibly soon to be discontent Trump followers but at this stage there is nothing the liberal left can do that won't be suspected of being staged. The Hillary crime team won't have anyone to blame when they are busted staging violence since they are already on record discussing staging violence to be blamed on Trump supporters. Planning ahead So as we approach election day I invite all Americans who understand the level of criminality and evil that Hillary represents to think how they would channel their energy in case of a Hillary selection in the upcoming election. Will you continue to do what you are doing now? If not, then what will you do differently? Will you vote again? Will you stand by and watch Hillary support and re-arm a dying ISIS CIA army in Syria so that the US can finally overthrow president Assad? Will you stand by and watch Hillary cement the Agenda 2030 plans, the global climate taxes, the illegal TTIP and TTP agreements that undermine national sovereignty? Will you watch her trigger WW3 with Russia and cement the global police state? Will you stand by and watch her run the country knowing how much of a criminal she herself is? Will you stand by and watch the Clinton body count sky rocket and watch more journalist murdered left and right for exposing this criminal empire? A Hillary global regime will officially represent the arrival of the new world order (though in many ways that is what the Obama and Bush administration has done) and anyone seeing her criminality today knows this. There is a lot of blood waiting to be shed somewhere out there. Whether it's the brutal Hillary led first official global regime or resistance to this regime locally or globally (WW3). There is however, also a narrow yet still realistic path by which minimal blood will be shed. It will likely be determined by how many people actually take action (especially those in uniforms- police and military). By action I'm referring to the American way of supporting true journalism, removing your consent, openly speaking your mind without fear of retribution, resisting tyranny, pursuing democracy, sharing information and self-sustaining solutions and being involved in peace activism based on conviction and strong belief in humanity, nature, justice and morality. Finally, humanity and all the values it believes in are all potentially in jeopardy. Everything is now threatened. Who will protect these values and how much sense of urgency there will be to do so will be determined this upcoming election day, for better or for worse. Help spread the word. One way or another paradigm shift is here. Submit your review

in: Science & Technology (The Verge) Today, Google's Threat Analysis group disclosed a critical vulnerability in Windows in a public post on the company's security blog. The bug itself is very specific — allowing attackers to escape from security sandboxes through a flaw in the win32k system — but it's serious enough to be categorized as critical, and according to Google, it's being actively exploited. As a result, Google went public just 10 days after reporting the bug to Microsoft, before a patch could be coded and deployed. The result is that, while Google has already deployed a fix to protect Chrome users, Windows itself is still vulnerable — and now, everybody knows it. Google's disclosure provides only a general description of the bug, giving users enough information to recognize a possible attack without making it too easy for criminals to replicate. Exploiting the bug also depends on a separate exploit in Adobe Flash, for which the company has also released a patch. Still, simply knowing that the bug exists will likely spur a lot of criminals to look for viable ways to exploit it against computers that have yet to update Flash.

in: Government , Special Interests (image credit: AP) Having closed his earlier investigation into Hillary's use of her private email server for classified State Department documents without bringing charges, dismissing indictable evidence, it's hard imagining a shift of agency policy now. So what's going on? Is FBI Director Comey trying to save face, even at this late stage, having tarnished the reputation of the agency and himself. The fullness of time will show what he has in mind. He faces intense political pressure from key Democrat senators, demanding immediate answers about why he's reopening his investigation days before November's election, an unprecedented act. Senators Patrick Leahy, Dianne Feinstein, Thomas Carper and Ben Cardin wrote Comey, saying: '(N)o later than Monday, 31 October 2016, we request you provide us with more detailed information about the investigative steps being taken, the number of emails involved, and what is being done to determine how many of the emails are duplicative of those already reviewed by the FBI.” They want Attorney General Loretta Lynch explaining her involvement in Comey's action, if any. The Hillary campaign called for 'public answers” to clarify what new information the FBI discovered. After saying that revisiting his decision last July would be unlikely, Comey opted for an October surprise – the likes of which Washington hasn't seen since the tumultuous end of Nixon's tenure. Paul Craig Roberts said he's gotten word 'that the FBI has reopened the Hillary case of her violation of US National Security protocols, not because of the content of the new email releases, but because voter support for Trump seems to be overwhelming, while Hillary has cancelled appearances due to inability to muster a crowd. The popular vote leaves the FBI far out on the limb for its corrupt clearance of Hillary. The agency now has to redeem itself.” How remains to be seen. Like Roberts, I'm puzzled. Washington power brokers chose Hillary to succeed Obama. Enormous resources, energy, corporate pollsters consistently showing her ahead, and one-sided scoundrel media support have gone into assuring it. Have things changed days before November 8? Are power brokers abandoning Hillary this late in the game? The last 48 hours have been breathtaking – the stuff Hollywood thrillers are made of. Will Hillary supporters blame Russia for Comey's action? One Democrat congressman suggested it. Will Comey be accused of being a Kremlin agent? However things unfold in the campaign's final days, Trump got a significant boost – whether enough for a 'master of suspense” Alfred Hitchcock ending remains to be seen. My view, right or wrong, remains the same. After going all-out for Hillary throughout months of campaigning, it's hard believing power brokers decided otherwise this late in the game – unheard of in US electoral politics. At the same time, this political season has been unlike any I remember since the 1940s. Nothing ahead will surprise me. Submit your review

in: Special Interests , US News Do you remember that scene in the old Frankenstein movie when the villagers descended on the castle with burning stakes and pitchforks? The hounds were baying, people were shouting incoherently, and ignorant, fearful villagers watched the whole thing? Listen in particular to the speech at the beginning of this. That's about what the person leading the charge against James Comey is saying. That's pretty much what is happening to FBI Director James Comey, who is in for a bumpy, maybe even death-defying, ride after i nforming Congress that an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server debacle was being reopened, against the advice of Loretta Lynch , Attorney General. According to Harry Reid, a US Senator and one of the head honchos of the Democratic Party, James Comey 'may” have broken the law by announcing that emails on devices associated with Hillary Clinton are under renewed investigation. He's referring to the Hatch Act, a law passed in 1939. It was officially called 'An Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities” and was adopted to prohibit executive branch federal employees (except the President and Vice President) from engaging in certain political activities, such as: using their 'official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election”; soliciting, accepting, or receiving political campaign contributions from any person; running 'for election to a partisan political office”; soliciting or discouraging participation in political activity of any person who either has an application for a grant, contract, or other status pending before the employing agency or is the subject of an ongoing audit, investigation, or enforcement action by the employing agency; engaging in partisan political activity on official duty time; on federal property; while wearing a uniform or insignia identifying them as federal officials or employees; or while using a government vehicle. ( source ) Will he be investigated for exposing a potential crime or will he be investigated for the timing of exposing a potential crime? It seems to me that keeping his mouth shut could also be in violation of the act – if he knew something and did not disclose it, wouldn't that also affect the outcome of the election? The other villagers are joining in. Reid isn't alone in the monster hunt. He's joined by some other villagers with torches, pitchforks, and hounds too. Take former Attorney General Eric Holder, for example. In a letter to the Clinton campaign, he wrote: Many of us have worked with Director Comey; all of us respect him. But his unprecedented decision to publicly comment on evidence in what may be an ongoing inquiry just eleven days before a presidential election leaves us both astonished and perplexed. We cannot recall a prior instance where a senior Justice Department official—Republican or Democrat—has, on the eve of a major election, issued a public statement where the mere disclosure of information may impact the election's outcome, yet the official acknowledges the information to be examined may not be significant or new.” ( source ) Perhaps Comey's decision had something to do with the fact that, as Zero Hedge reported , the DoJ stifled an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation donating money to the political campaign of the wife of an FBI investigator. (I know, it's sort of like my brother's sister's cousin's husband's uncle.”) Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota Law School professor and the chief White House ethics lawyer for a couple of years during the Bush Administration, wrote an op-ed for the New York Times . He said he's filing a complaint. The F.B.I.'s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election. 
Such acts could also be prohibited under the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an election. That is why the F.B.I. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election. The usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment. 
That is why, on Saturday, I filed a complaint against the F.B.I. with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations, and with the Office of Government Ethics. I spent much of my career working on government and lawyers' ethics, including as the chief White House ethics lawyer for George W. Bush. I never thought that the F.B.I. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. Until this week. ( Source ) The Mainstream Media (MSM) will not be kind to Comey. Of course, when are they ever kind to people who oppose the Clinton Monarchy? The so-called journalists have armed up with self-righteousness and propagandist pitchforks. Here are some related headlines: In Releasing Email News, FBI Director Ignored Justice Department Advice, Tradition – Slate FBI's James Comey under fire after jolting presidential race – MSNBC Harry Reid: FBI Director James Comey might have broken federal law – Washington Times Clinton Allies Target Comey as Probe Scrambles Campaign – Bloomberg Basically Everybody Thinks James Comey Has F***ed Up – Mother Jones And of course, everyone knows how much I love (cough) Huffington Post , which was a trove of ridiculous headlines like: Former Attorney General Eric Holder: FBI Director James Comey 'Violated' Justice Department Policies Harry Reid Blasts FBI Director James Comey Over Handling Of Clinton Email Probe First Poll Since James Comey Announcement Shows No Effect On Hillary Clinton — Yet Dozens Of Former Federal Prosecutors Sign Open Letter Criticizing James Comey James Comey Just Unmasked Himself The director of the FBI is between a rock and a hard place. If he had said nothing, he would have been pilloried for remaining silent. Today he is being pilloried because he did. The man had a stack of resignation letters on his desk from angry FBI agents who knew what was going on. Comey was not alone in the belief that something had to be done to allow the American people to know who they are actually voting for. He's just the one who is taking the hit for it. A leaked memo to FBI employees probably gives the best picture of Comey's mindset when he made the decision to put himself in the line of fire. In a memo explaining his decision to FBI employees soon after he sent his letter to Congress, Comey said he felt 'an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed.” He admitted that he broke with custom in alerting lawmakers that the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server was being reopened because of its political sensitivity. He further explained to FBI employees that 'Of course we don't ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed . I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.” …'At the same time, however, given that we do not know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don't want to create a misleading impression,” Comey's letter continued. 'In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter, and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it.” ( source ) He is in a lose-lose situation, and I'm sure he knew this. It seems to me that knowing he's going to be dead the ex-director of the FBI sooner rather than later, he has done what he believes is the right thing. Personally, I can't fault Comey for doing what he did. Maybe he was trying to undo the wrong he did in letting her off in the first place. He's taking one for the team and most likely sacrificing his career – if not also his life – by taking the action that he took, considering how things tend to go for people who run afoul of the Clintons . It's anyone's guess what will happen between now and November 8th. Grab some popcorn, my friends. We're in for an eventful week. Article first posted at DaisyLuther.com Submit your review

in: Politics , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests 'And I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her.” I realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre, but in this article I will explain why this could actually happen. We have just learned that the FBI has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650,000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Now that the FBI is going through these emails, it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime could be made by November 8th. Of course the most likely scenario is that Hillary Clinton will not be indicted before election day and that Americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Clinton campaign. But if the FBI does quickly take action, it is possible that Hillary Clinton could be forced from the race before election day, and that would require the Democrats to come up with a new candidate. In fact, there are already calls in the mainstream media for Clinton to willingly remove herself from the race. For example, the following comes from a Chicago Tribune article entitled ' Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside '… So what should the Democrats do now? If ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: They would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. Democrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. But what the author of that article does not understand is that Tim Kaine would not automatically take her place if Clinton steps down before the election. In a previous article , I included a quote from a U.S. News & World Report article that explained what would happen if Hillary Clinton was removed from the Democratic ticket for some reason prior to November 8th… If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year's primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members – a number that changes over time and is guided by the group's bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. So if this email scandal forced Hillary Clinton to exit the race at the last minute, a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee would gather to select a new nominee. Who would they choose? Let's take a look at the top five options… #1 Tim Kaine He would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Hillary Clinton's running mate. But to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition, and most Americans outside of the state of Virginia have very little familiarity with him. And at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail. In fact, attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens. So to me it seems unlikely that the DNC would select Kaine as the replacement nominee. #2 Joe Biden Vice-President Joe Biden has far more name recognition than Tim Kaine does, and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run … Vice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it. Biden was asked in an interview with CNN Saturday if news that the FBI was re-opening their criminal probe into Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run. But according to the vice president, the short answer is 'no.” The only thing that kept him from running, Biden said, was the recent death of his son, Beau. Unfortunately for Biden, he suffers from many of the same things that Kaine does. Biden is boring, he is not very good on the campaign trail, and he doesn't have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers. Biden would probably represent the 'safest” choice for the Democrats, but he might not be a winning choice. #3 Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to Hillary Clinton, but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Bernie Sanders. First of all, he does not have any real loyalty to the Democrats. He has previously operated as an independent, and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over. Secondly, the Democratic establishment very much dislikes him, and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this. Thirdly, Democratic insiders fear that he would be 'another McGovern” and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election. So even though he is very popular with the radical left, it appears that Sanders would be the least likely choice on this list. #4 Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren would be very popular with the 'Bernie Sanders” wing of the party, and she would enable the party to replace Hillary Clinton with another woman. So she is definitely a possibility. But she does lack name recognition, and just like Sanders there would be concern that the Republicans would frame her candidacy as 'another McGovern” because of her far left policies. #5 Michelle Obama One recent survey found that 67 percent of all Democrats would rather have a third term for Obama than a first term for Hillary Clinton. And these days Barack Obama's approval rating is running anywhere from +9 to +11. So the thought of another Obama in the White House is not as far-fetched as you might think. Michelle Obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list, and she is generally very well-liked by the American people. And she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently. For instance, her recent speech in New Hampshire was lauded as 'the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign” in a recent MSN article entitled ' In this campaign, Michelle Obama became more than just another political voice '… The speech, amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response, cemented Obama's place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view Trump, but also on herself as a voice of moral authority. Three months before leaving the White House, she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title. 'When you rise to a level like that, you see how much weight your words carry,” said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University. 'We know she didn't like politics. But she was impassioned by the language that was used, and she feels compelled to speak out. People listen to her.” If I were the Democrats, Michelle Obama is the one that I would select if a replacement nominee was needed, because she would give them the very best chance of winning against Donald Trump. Of course the Obamas are just as radical as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but the American people have become quite comfortable with them at this point. And I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her. In the final analysis, none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the FBI will move quickly enough to force Hillary Clinton out before election day, but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen. And if it does happen, it is going to turn politics in America completely upside down. Submit your review

in: Government , Government Corruption , Special Interests Oh, Loretta. I'll bet that AG Loretta Lynch is shaking in her boots right now, because when Hillary Clinton goes down, Lynch's career will go down with her. Heck, maybe they'll even be cellmates. Loretta Lynch's ties to the Clintons go back to 1999 when then-President Bill Clinton appointed her to run the Brooklyn US Attorney's office. She left in 2002 and went into private practice, but returned to the Brooklyn office in 2010 at the behest of President Barack Obama. ( Here's her official bio. ) In 2015, she was sworn in to become the 83rd Attorney General of the United States, taking the place of the blatantly corrupt Attorney General, Eric Holder , who will probably be most famous for his roles in the Fast and Furious operation, inciting racial tensions, and his mishandling of the Lois Lerner/IRS debacle. First, there was the secret airplane meeting with Bill Clinton It all started to publically go downhill for Lynch during the first investigation into Hillary Clinton's carelessness with national secrets via her home email server . Right before FBI Director James Comey was to meet with Hillary Clinton to interrogate her about the subject, Lynch was busted having a secret meeting with Bill Clinton. The Washington Post reported: Clinton's private, unplanned meeting with Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch at the Phoenix airport last week, coming at a time when the Justice Department should be nearing completion of its examination of Hillary Clinton's use of a private server for her emails as secretary of state, will inevitably — and negatively — affect public attitudes about that investigation… …Lynch has tried to make amends, though not without leaving some confusion in her wake. In a conversation Friday with Washington Post editorial writer Jonathan Capehart at the Aspen Ideas Festival, she insisted again that the conversation was innocent — about grandchildren and golf and such — and did not touch on the investigation of the emails. But she said she recognized that others would not see it that way. 'The fact that the meeting that I had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work is something that I take seriously, and deeply and painfully,” she said. Lynch said that she would 'be accepting” whatever recommendation the career prosecutors and FBI Director James B. Comey bring her — though she did not say she would remove herself completely from the case. She also said she had made that decision some months ago but was only now making it public. Of course, it was all much easier for Lynch to abide by the decision when Comey miraculously found that Hillary Clinton was not criminal in her negligence with national secrets. Now, though, people are asking questions about that ill-founded meeting. Judicial Watch has filed a lawsuit for 'all records” related to the illicit meeting between Attorney General Lynch and former President Bill Clinton. 'On June 29, 2016, Attorney General Loretta Lynch is reported to have met privately with former President Bill Clinton on board a parked private plane at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona. The meeting occurred during the then-ongoing investigation of Mrs. Clinton's email server, and mere hours before the Benghazi report was released publicly involving both Mrs. Clinton and the Obama administration. Judicial Watch filed a request on June 30 that the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General investigate that meeting.” Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested that during that meeting, Bill Clinton may have offered to extend Lynch's position in the AG's office during a Hillary Clinton administration. Then she blocked a congressional investigation into the notorious Iranian ransom payment. Last week, AG Lynch blocked a congressional investigation into the cash payments that the Obama administration made to Iran by pleading the Fifth. The Washington Free Beacon reported: Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administration's secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has 'pleaded the Fifth” Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon … …'It is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the people's elected representatives in Congress about an important national security issue,” the lawmakers wrote. 'Your staff failed to address any of our questions, and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue.” 'As the United States' chief law enforcement officer, it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries,” they stated. 'The actions of your department come at time when Iran continues to hold Americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison.” How very judicial of her. Lynch tried to shut Comey up about the new investigation into the Clinton emails. Now, even the mainstream media can't turn its head. Earlier I wrote about the fact that FBI Director James Comey made the decision on his own to go public about the new investigation into the Hillary Clinton emails. But let's talk a little further about Lynch's desperate attempts to shut him up. The New York Times reported that the Justice Department 'strongly discouraged Comey” against releasing the information: The day before the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, sent a letter to Congress announcing that new evidence had been discovered that might be related to the completed Hillary Clinton email investigation, the Justice Department strongly discouraged the step and told him that he would be breaking with longstanding policy, three law enforcement officials said on Saturday. Senior Justice Department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter, officials said, but they did everything short of it, pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections. How interesting that it's seen as 'influencing the election” to investigate someone now but it wasn't back when she was investigated and not charged. I'm not sure exactly how that works, but according to USA Today (emphasis mine), a '…federal official familiar with Comey's decision said Saturday that the FBI director considered the attorney general's advice during a spirited discussion of the matter Thursday and early Friday but felt compelled to act.” Do you remember Janet Reno? Poor Janet was another Attorney General who went down for the Clintons. She was also sworn in as AG under Bill Clinton, and many questioned her appointment at the time. According to a report in the Chicago Tribune : She arrived in Washington from Miami as Caesar's wife, and so she has remained. She was ignorant and independent of insider D.C. and has stayed that way. Bill Clinton never much liked her and never confided in her, and she reciprocated. She became AG just in time to take the fall for the debacle in Waco , actually. According to History.com The Waco standoff had already begun by the time Janet Reno became the first female attorney general on March 12, 1993. She approved the FBI's tear gas plan the following month, explaining that negotiations with the Branch Davidians had stalemated and that the children inside the compound were at risk. 'We will never know whether there was a better solution,” Reno said in 1995. 'Everyone involved … made their best judgments based on all the information we had.” Nonetheless, a Republican-led congressional report called her decision 'premature, wrong and highly irresponsible.” She was also criticized when facts emerged contradicting some of her earlier statements. The Tribune post continued to discuss Reno's position as a scapegoat: Every day since she took office , she has been supervising at least one probe embarrassing to Clinton–Whitewater, fundraising, Lewinsky, China espionage, etc. Clinton can't afford the political beating he would take if he cashiered her. …But no such attorney general could have survived the Clinton scandals, much less survived them with her own reputation–and her department's–intact. Attorney Generals who have anything to do with the Clintons don't seem to fare too well. They end up so embroiled in Clinton scandals that they, too, are pulled down into the mire, regardless of what their intentions were when they started out. Lynch can see her future…and it has something to do with 'Help Wanted” ads The last time Lynch was involved in the Clinton email kerfuffle, she promised to abide by FBI Director James Comey's recommendation. I wonder if she'll make that same promise this time? She really can't, because if she does, it will show she was complicit with the Clintons the last time around, and also this time when she decried Comey's release of information about the investigation. I wonder if she and Hillary Clinton will be able to get adjoining cells when/if the truth comes out. Article first posted at DaisyLuther.com Submit your review

in: Government , Government Corruption , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests (image: REUTERS/Gary Cameron) Had Comey recommended Hillary be held criminally responsible for mishandling classified State Department documents last July, along with perjury for lying to the FBI and Congress, a firestorm of criticism wouldn't have followed his Friday announcement. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D. NV) accused him of 'tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo,” saying his action 'appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another” – claiming he 'may have broken the law,” citing the 1939 Hatch Act (An Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities). It prohibits federal executive branch employees from engaging in certain forms of political activity – exempting the president, vice president and designated high-level administration officials. Proof of intent is required to hold someone culpable under the law. According to the Wall Street Journal , within the FBI, there was 'sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the Clintons, and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national election campaign.” In a prominently featured NYT op-ed , Law Professor Richard Painter said '(w)e cannot allow FBI or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power.” Not according to former federal prosecutor Daniel Richman, saying 'Comey's critics cannot show his letter violated the Hatch Act unless they can prove that the FBI director was intending to influence the election rather than inform Congress, which was (his) stated aim.” A Sunday released ABC News/Washington Post poll indicated about a third of likely voters are less likely to support Hillary following Comey's October surprise. The Washington Post said the Justice Department's public integrity unit blocked the FBI from investigating the Clinton Foundation, claiming inadequate 'evidence to move forward.” The department is run by longtime Bill and Hillary ally, Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Last June, she met privately with the former president at Phoenix's Sky Harbor airport while Hillary was under FBI investigation – a clear conflict of interest despite her disingenuously claiming 'no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body” took place. In a Washington Post op-ed , former attorney general Eric Holder expressed concern about Comey's 'vague letter to Congress about emails potentially connected to a matter of public, and political, interest” – claiming he 'violated long-standing Justice Department policies and tradition.” Holder disgraced the office he held. Law Professor Francis Boyle called him 'a total disaster for the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights, Human Rights and the Rule of Law.” Speaking in Florida on Sunday, Hillary changed the subject, saying 'there's a lot of noise and distraction, but it really comes down to what kind of future we want, and what kind of president can help us get there. We won't be distracted no matter what our opponents throw at us.” Clearly, Comey's bombshell changed the dynamic of the race, whether enough to derail her White House bid we'll know in days. Reports indicate the FBI will examine an astonishing 650,000 emails from former Congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop – estranged husband of top Hillary aide Huma Abedin. It could take months to review volume this immense, likely extending well beyond November 8 and January's inauguration, to determine if any evidence warrants prosecuting Hillary, Abedin, Weiner or anyone else for mishandling classified government documents, perhaps compromising national security. Having absolved Hillary in July, despite plenty of indictable evidence, it's hard imagining a change of FBI policy now. Submit your review

in: Government Corruption , US News It's been almost a week since FBI director announced the reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's illegal use of her state department emails and this story is only getting bigger with every passing day. Hillary's fully controlled liberal left mainstream media and her attack dog politicians and authority figure minions are doing things that some may argue resemble a silent coup d'etat. Yes, I'm talking about an American coup d'etat. I believe in many ways we are witnessing a slow motion coup d'etat that if it succeeds it will mark the permanent end to the rule of law, any resemblance of justice and the end of America itself. Let's begin by first looking at the definition of coup d'etat : a sudden and decisive action in politics, especially one resulting in a change of government illegally or by force Recently reopened by the FBI, the investigation of Hillary's criminality is very real and under any normal circumstances would or should guarantee not only her removal as presidential candidate regardless of how close we are to the elections, but also a warrant for her arrest. The Hillary crime team is not about to lay down for this incredible moment in US history however. Hillary has unleashed her attackers on the FBI and its director James Comey, who of course has been one of Hillary's very controlled minions all along until now perhaps. To counter the application of the rule of law (remember, Hillary broke the law), to preserve her road to presidency and to block her road to jail Hillary's attack dogs have been released on the justice system itself, something historically unusual and alone worthy of top news status. Attack dog number one, Senator Harry Reid recently threatened FBI director Comey stating the following in a letter to him: I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act… Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law. Historically and astonishingly Reid is attempting to put the elections before the rule of law itself. This is apparently a common theme and strategy in the Hillary criminal camp. So much so that they are attempting to make this about James Comey instead of the actual criminal who broke the law, Hillary Clinton. Attorney General Loretta Lynch also jumped in on this pro-Hillary, screw-the-rule-of-law narrative now being perpetuated by the pro-Hillary minions and attack dogs when it was reported that she 'advised Comey not to send a letter to Congress informing them of the discovery of new emails”. The New Yorker put out anonymous quotes designed to attack Comey saying (anonymity emphasized in bold) 'You don't do this,” one former senior Justice Department official exclaimed . 'It's aberrational. It violates decades of practice.” The reason, according to the former official, who asked not to be identified because of ongoing cases involving the department, 'is because it impugns the integrity and reputation of the candidate, even though there's no finding by a court, or in this instance even an indictment.” In fact, according to the Washington Post James Comey's critics are ' growing by the hour '. All of this is a continuation of what we've been seeing throughout this US presidential election campaign. Ignore the suspect on trial and attack the investigator instead. Ignore the details of the videos and emails being revealed and question the source or blame it on Russia. In the case of Hillary, this craziness is what we've been seeing for decades. Hillary (like Bill) is above the law and any attempt to bring her to justice will be fought and resisted by her army. They know that they are close to taking over the presidency (very likely via voting fraud ) that they don't have to answer to the rule of law. The process of getting Hillary in, which we call election day, is therefore more important than the application of the law itself and justice. According to the pro-Hillary resistance (to the rule of law and justice), removing a potential criminal candidate who has repeatedly lied and murdered her enemies is apparently only of secondary importance to election day itself. The idea, the deep rooted delusional belief that Hillary really is actually above the law seems to be believed by her followers, supporters and attack dogs. Thus by perpetuating this belief they (the Hillary attack dogs) are trying to WILL their way into a Hillary presidential victory while completely ignoring the possibility and prospects that Hillary is in fact a criminal. It's incredible how times have changed. It's like we are watching the Watergate scandal in reverse. Imagine if AFTER the Watergate scandals of the 1970's THEN Richard Nixon would have ran for president instead of the other way around. This, my friends, is what we are seeing with Hillary. The logic sequence goes like this: 1. Hillary criminality revealed and exposed to the world via leaks, witnesses, emails etc. 2. Hillary body count rises, many of her enemies coincidentally end up dead. The world watches this. 3. Hillary's fully revealed criminality not allowed to be investigated because pursuing justice is seen as 'interfering” with an election. 4. Known criminal Hillary Clinton becomes president and assumes power with the aid of George Soros and a mass criminal operation of voter fraud. 5. Hillary assumes power to go after all her enemies who tried to hold her to the law. Again, this is their (the pro-Hillary insiders) desired sequence and this is how they want to see things unfold. Adding to the recent attacks from the Clinton attack dogs Democratic Strategist James Carville recently stated: 'This is in effect an attempt to hijack an election,” Carville claimed. 'It's unprecedented… the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy,” he said. Yes, the KGB apparently is behind the recent application of the rule of law as it pertains to Hillary's lies and criminality now further revealed in her personal assistant's ( Huma Abedin ) emails discovered by the FBI. The emails that offer further hard evidence to the Hillary criminal accusations. According to the NEW rule of law, especially the rule of law that Hillary will bring with her regime, none of this apparently matters any more. What most Americans don't see is how closely all of this resembles a coup d'etat. Taking over the rule of law and declaring your own version of the law is a takeover any which way you cut it. The arrogance seen in Hillary Clinton in one hearing after another which she has sat for is mind boggling. At no point in any of these hearings (including the Benghazi hearings) has Hillary ever admitted doing anything wrong. She has just the right arrogance to take over the criminal Obama regime and push the West's global order plans forward. She has just the right arrogance and criminal mindset to push the world into world war 3 and destroy whatever is left of America and individual freedom. Everything we are watching resembles an American coup d'etat from a legal point of view if you ask me. And the Hillary attack dogs at every level are riding out the final storm before (they hope) they insert their leader on election day. The criminals ignoring the rule of law surely have a stake in what they hope will be the next regime. Submit your review

in: War Propaganda , World News If it's not Islamophobia, it's Russophobia. Tired of Western propaganda? Get Vladimir Putin's perspective with words straight from the horse's mouth. Vladimir Putin in particular, and Russia in general, have been the focus of an intensive high-drama propaganda campaign of late. Are you buying it? For the time being, Russophobia has replaced Islamophobia as the driving force behind the lies. Various US officials have been frantically warning Americans that the Russians are behind everything: hacking the DNC, controlling Trump, influencing the election and breaking the Syrian ceasefire agreement. They might as well add making your girlfriend break up with you, making your toast get burnt and making your car run out of fuel for all the evidence they have presented. Many of these totally unfounded allegations stem from (naturally) the Clinton campaign, home to career criminals Bill and Hillary Clinton , who are desperately seeking to find something to gain some sort of shred of popularity or advantage over Trump, who fills up arenas with 1000s of people more easily than Clinton can fill a high school gym with 50. Many US officials and war hawks are trying to get in on the action; CIA man Mike Morell indicated it would be a good idea to covertly kill Russians to make them 'pay a price” ; Hillary Clinton called Vladimir Putin the 'grand godfather of extreme nationalism” and blamed him for the rising popularity of right-wing leaders; and even standing VP Joe Biden came out and said that, 'We're sending a message to Putin … it will be at the time of our choosing and under the circumstances that have the greatest impact” . It seems there is no depth to which some US leaders won't stoop in order to gain some political advantage, even it means lying, demonizing and destroying geopolitical partnerships in order to garner a few brownie points. Russophobia is in full swing before the US Presidential Election to distract American voters. Vladimir Putin: It's All About Distraction During Election Season You would think Russian President Vladimir President would be agitated by all of this mud-slinging. At times he has been, for instance when he issued a warning a few months ago about an impending WW3 due to NATO's constant aggression and advancement towards Russian borders. However, judging by his own words and mostly calm demeanor, he has seen through the agenda and understands what is going on. Putin spells out how it's all inflamed rhetoric before an election season, an old trick used by politicians to distract when they have no meaningful solutions for internal and domestic problems. Here is Vladimir Putin in his own words : 'You can expect anything from our American friends … the only novelty is that for the first time, on the highest level, the United States has admitted involvement in these activities, and to some extent threatened [us] – which of course does not meet the standards of international communication. As if we didn't know that US Government bodies snoop on and wiretap anyone? Everyone knows this … Apparently, they are nervous. The question is why. I think there is a reason. You know, in an election campaign, the current government carefully crafts a pre-election strategy, and any government, especially when seeking re-election, always has unresolved issues. They need to show, to explain to the voters why they remain unresolved. In the US, there are many such problems … for example, the massive public debt is a time bomb for the US economy and global financial system … more examples can be cited in foreign policy … in these conditions, many choose to resort to the usual tactics of distracting voters from their problems … try to create an enemy and rally the nation against that enemy … Iran and the Iranian threat did not work well for that. Russia is a more interesting story.” And that's exactly what this whole thing is: a giant story. However, as Voltaire once said, if you can make someone believe absurdities, you can make them commit atrocities. Let's see what else Vladimir Putin has to say on other topics of interest. Russian Hacking: A Laughable Claim so the Clintons and DNC Can Try to Avoid Culpability Let's face it: the whole Russophobia affair is about avoiding blame, dodging responsibility and evading liability. Thanks to WikiLeaks, Project Veritas and many other sources, we know the entire Hillary Clinton campaign has been rigged beyond belief. Fake primaries, fake speeches, fake images, fake videos, fake crowds, fake supporters and fake debates. There is seemingly no depth of criminality to which that woman won't sink. She's selling out the presidency before she even gets there, such as the stunt of trying to promise future presidential executive orders to mega donors. There is not a shred of evidence that Russia is affiliated with WikiLeaks or behind any of the DNC hacks. As this Zero Hedge article NSA Whistleblower: US Intelligence Worker Likely Behind DNC Leaks, Not Russia states: 'On 'Judge Napolitano Chambers,” the Judge said that while the DNC, government officials, and the Clinton campaign all accuse the Russians of hacking into the DNC servers, 'the Russians had nothing to do with it.” Napolitano then mentioned Binney, arguing the NSA veteran and whistleblower who 'developed the software that the NSA now uses, which allows it to capture not just metadata but content of every telephone call, text message, email in the United States of every person in [the country]” knew the NSA had hacked the DNC — not the Russians. If Judge Napolitano and Binney are right and the NSA did hack the DNC, what was the motive? According to the Judge, 'members of the intelligence community simply do not want [Clinton] to be president of the United States.” 'She doesn't know how to handle state secrets,” Napolitano continued. And since 'some of the state secrets that she revealed used the proper true names of American intelligence agents operating undercover in the Middle East,” some of these agents were allegedly captured and killed, prompting NSA agents to feel compelled to act. Whether NSA agents hacked the DNC or not, one thing is clear: there's no real evidence linking the DNC and Arizona and Illinois voting system hacks to the Russian government.” The Mythical 'Russian Threat” Vladimir Putin directly addressed another mythical story, that of the so-called Russian threat and Russian aggression , at the recent Valdai forum in Sochi from October 24-27, 2016: 'There is another mechanism to ensure the transatlantic security, European security, the OC security and their attempt at turning this organization (NATO) into an instrument of someone's political interests. So what the OC is doing is simply void. Mythical threats are devised like the so-called Russian military threat. Certainly this can be (used to) gain some advantage, get new budgets, make your allies comply with your demands, make NATO deploy the equipment and troops closer to our border … Russia is not trying to attack anyone. That would be ridiculous … The population of Europe is 300 million … and the population of the US is 300 million, while the population of Russia is 140 million, yet such menaces are served as a pretext. Hysteria has been fueled in the US with regard to Russia's alleged influence with the current presidential election. Is there anyone who seriously thinks that Russia can influence the choice of the American people? Is the US a banana republic? The US is a great power. If I'm wrong please correct me.” Here's what he had to say about who the real aggressor is when it comes to the US and Russia: 'Is it known to you that Russia, in the 90s, completely halted (as did the USSR) any strategic aviation in the further afield regions of patrol, i.e. not in the closer abroad. We halted such activity completely. US geostrategic aviation however, with nuclear weapons on board. They continued to encircle us! What for? Who are you concerned about? Or why are you threatening us? We continued with the non-patrol year after year. It is only since about 3 years ago that we restarted aviation patrol further abroad. Which party is the provocateur here? Is it us? We have only 2 military bases abroad. They are known areas of terrorism dangers … US bases on the other hand are all over the world. And you are telling me that I am the aggressor? Have you any common sense? What are US forces doing in Europe, including nuclear weaponry? What business have they got there? Listen to me. Our military budget, while increased slightly from last year, in the dollar equivalent, is about US$50 billion. The military budget of the Pentagon is almost 10 times that amount. $575 billion, I think Congress singed off on. And you're telling me I'm the aggressor here? Have you no common sense at all? Is it us putting our forces on the border of the US? Or other states? Is it NATo, or who, that is moving their bases closer to us? Military infrastructure! It's not us. Does anyone even listen to us? Or try to have some kind of dialogue with us? The repeated answer we get is ‘mind your own business' and ‘each country can choose its own security measures'. Very well, so will we … And finally, on the antiballistic missile defense system, who was it that exited from the treaty which was vital to the entire system of international security? Was it us? No. It was the States. In a one-sided way, they simply withdrew from the treaty. Now they are threatening us, turning their missiles towards us, not only from Alaska, but also from Europe too … We want to develop normal relations in the sphere of security, in the fight against terrorism, in the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We want to work together with you … so long as you want that too.” US Repeatedly Broke Its Promises to Russia and Destroyed Trust The Western MSM is so one-sided in its coverage of geopolitical events like Ukraine and Syria. Anyone not toeing the line with US-UK-NATO interests is painted in a bad light. In point of fact, it has actually been the US who has been breaking agreements with Russia since the end of the Cold War. US leaders lied to Russian leaders at the time, by promising that NATO would not extend any further eastward, and possibly even hinting that Russia could join NATO. As Eric Zuesse explains in his article America Trashes NATO Founding Act; Rushes Weapons to Russia's Borders : 'The NATO Founding Act was agreed to between the US and Russia in 1997 in order to provide to Russia's leader Boris Yeltsin some modicum of assurance that America wouldn't invade his country. When his predecessor Mikhail Gorbachev had ended the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact military alliance in 1991, the representatives of US President GHW Bush told him that NATO wouldn't move «one inch to the east» (toward Russia), but as soon as Gorbachev committed himself to end the Cold War, Bush told his agents, regarding what they had all promised to Gorbachev (Bush's promise which had been conveyed through them), «To hell with that! We prevailed, they didn't». In other words: Bush's prior instructions to them were merely his lies to Gorbachev, his lies to say that the US wouldn't try to conquer Russia (move its forces eastward to Russia's borders); but, now, since Gorbachev was committed and had already agreed that East Germany was to be reunited with and an extension of West Germany (and the process for doing that had begun), Bush pulled that rug of lies out from under the end of the Cold War …” Bill Clinton carried on the great American legacy of exceptionalism (that is, excepting themselves from obeying international law) spearheaded by Daddy Bush of surrounding and dominating Russia by allowing NATO into the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. Russia got shafted by trusting the US numerous times after the fall of the Soviet Union. Here's Vladimir Putin once again on America's broken promises (in April 2016): 'In the early 2000s, we agreed with the Americans to destroy weapons-grade plutonium, on both sides. We were talking about the excessive amounts that were manufactured by both the US and Russia. This is the enriched uranium from which nuclear weapons are made. 34000 tonnes, from both sides. We signed an agreement, and decided that this material would be destroyed in a specific manner. It would be destroyed in an industrial way – for which special plants needed to be built. We fulfilled our obligations – we built the necessary plant. Our American partners did not. Moreover, recently they announced that rather than destroy the enriched material in the manner that we agreed, and signed an international agreement on, that they would dilute it and store it in a holding capacity. This means they retain the potential to bring it back … Surely our American partners must understand that, jokes are one thing, such as creating smear campaigns against Russia, but questions of nuclear security are another thing entirely … they must learn to fulfill their promises. They once said they would close down Guantanamo. And? Is it closed? No.” Incidentally, this is the exact same plutonium agreement which made the news last month, when as reported on October 3rd, 216, Russia suspended their deal with the US on disposal of plutonium from decommissioned nuclear warheads. A decree signed by Vladimir Putin lists ' the radical change in the environment, a threat to strategic stability posed by the hostile actions of the US against Russia, and the inability of the US to deliver on the obligation to dispose of excessive weapons plutonium under international treaties, as well as the need to take swift action to defend Russian security” as the reasons for why Russia chose to suspend the deal. Conclusion: Wake up and Smell the Russophobia Expect Vladimir Putin and Russia to keep being demonized by the Clintons – and more importantly the NWO manipulators who so desperately want them in power. Although the Clintons are a powerful modern American mafia family, replete with a long body count behind them, it's important to remember they are lackeys for far greater and more pervasive powers (check out some of Hillary's lovey-dovey letters to Lynn Forester de Rothschild here ). There's a lot at stake here. Right now, Vladimir Putin and Russia are being used with the sole purpose of getting Clinton elected. Although Putin is not perfect and has his own dark side, he deserves respect for standing his ground and refusing to become another US puppet. If we are to believe his own words, he has no qualm with Americans or even America itself, but rather the selfish, imperialistic and murderous agenda of the NWO agents running the USA: 'We have a great deal of respect and love for the United States, and especially for the American people … [however] the expansion of jurisdiction by one nation beyond the territory of its borders, to the rest of the world, is unacceptable and destructive for international relations.” It's up to the American public to switch off CNN (Clinton News Network) and all the other duplicitous MSM channels and get truly informed. Vladimir Putin is reaching out his hand to America, in the hope that enough Americans can reclaim their country and work together with other nations in peace. On the issue of Vladimir Putin and Russia, the MSM is not just one-sided, it's outright lying.

in: Natural Medicine , Toxins A remarkable study published in the journal of Basic & Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology revealed something very special about garlic: it is a natural detoxifier of lead and is not only as effective as a common chelation drug known as d-penicillamine at pulling this metal out of the body but is also much safer. The study was titled, ' Comparison of therapeutic effects of garlic and d-penicillamine in patients with chronic occupational lead poisoning,” and sought to confirm previous research in animals that showed garlic (Allium sativum) is effective in reducing blood and tissue lead concentrations. [1] The study took the measurements of the blood lead concentrations of 117 workers at a car battery plant who were randomly assigned to two groups of garlic (1.2 milligrams of allicin from approximately 1,000 mg of garlic extract, three times daily) and d-penicillamine (250 mg, three times daily) and treated for 4 weeks. Clinical signs and symptoms of lead poisoning were also investigated and compared with the initial findings. The study found: Clinical improvement was significant in a number of clinical manifestations including irritability (p = 0.031), headache (p = 0.028), decreased deep tendon reflex (p=0.019) and mean systolic blood pressure (0.021) after treatment with garlic, but not d-penicillamine. BLCs [blood lead concentrations] were reduced significantly (p=0.002 and p=0.025) from 426.32±185.128 to 347.34±121.056μg/L and from 417.47±192.54 to 315.76±140.00μg/L in the garlic and d-penicillamine groups, respectively, with no significant difference (p=0.892) between the two groups . The frequency of side effects was significantly (p=0.023) higher in d-penicillamine than in the garlic group . Thus, garlic seems safer clinically and as effective as d-penicillamine. Therefore, garlic can be recommended for the treatment of mild-to-moderate lead poisoning. Clearly, despite the near equal reduction in measurable blood lead concentrations in both groups, improvements in various measured clinical manifestations were only found in the garlic group . Also, side effects were higher in the d-penicillamine group. These results clearly indicate the superiority of garlic over the drug and underscore how drug-based interventions often end up 'normalizing' target values, e.g. blood lead concentrations, without resulting in improvement in the quality of life or even the objective clinical signs and subjective symptoms of the treated patient; to the contrary, often the patient feels and is much worse off following drug treatment. Last year, a remarkable study published in the journal Basic & Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology revealed something very special about garlic: it is a natural detoxifier of lead and is not only as effective as a common chelation drug known as d-penicillamine at pulling this metal out of the body but is also much safer.

Lead exposure is ubiquitous in our modern age, and has been estimated to account for approximately 0.2% of all deaths and 0.6% of disability adjusted life years globally. [2] Exposure to this heavy metal results in harm to the cardiovascular, skeletal, gastrointestinal, kidney, reproductive and nervous systems of the human body. It has been identified to be particularly harmful to infants and children, whose developing nervous systems are far more susceptible to lead toxicity than those of adults. In fact, a 2008 PLoS study found decreased brain volume in adults who had been exposed to lead as children. [3] The standard of care involving drugs such as d-penicillamine is dismal, considering that the chemical has been linked to the following side effects: Anemia, Aplastic

in: Human Rights , War Propaganda , World News (image: REUTERS/Khaled Abdullah) US naked aggression on Yemen gets scant scoundrel media coverage. It includes undeclared drone war begun post-9/11, Obama continuing what George Bush began, civilians harmed most of all. In March 2015, Saudi Arabia and other regional rogue states, backed by America and its NATO partners, began terror-bombing Houthi forces, falsely called terrorists. Casualties are multiples higher than officially reported, civilians ruthlessly slaughtered – war in Yemen another bonanza for US, UK, French and German weapons makers, along with war-profiteers from other countries. Earlier in October, Saudi warplanes terror-bombed a Sanaa Houthi funeral ceremony, killing and wounding hundreds of civilians – the single deadliest incident in over 18 months of fighting so far. Washington bears full responsibility. Riyadh shares it. Conflict continues raging, the Pentagon selecting targets for Saudi warplanes to terror-bomb. Over the weekend, a Saudi-led 'coalition” airstrike targeted a prison and nearby administration buildings in Houthi-controlled Hodeidah, destroying facilities struck, massacring dozens, wounding many more victims, separately hitting Hodeidah's port. Saudi military spokesman General Ahmed Asiri lied, claiming facilities struck were used as 'a command and control center for (Houthi) operations.” Hours before the Hodeidah terror-bombing, Saudi warplanes massacred at least 18 civilians in Taiz, including 11 members of one family. Throughout months of fighting, Saudi warplanes terror-bombed schools, hospitals, residential areas, commercial marketplaces and other nonmilitary targets. Conflict resolution efforts failed because Washington, Riyadh and their rogue partners want war, not peace – holding an entire nation hostage to their viciousness, a severe humanitarian crisis taking unknown numbers of lives. Separately, on October 28, Saudi Arabia was overwhelmingly reelected to the UN Human Rights Council (HRC), a body infested with major human rights abusers. Heavy US pressure got General Assembly members to vote Russia off the HRC. Genocidal war on Yemen continues, the body failing to condemn the slaughter. It doesn't promote human rights. It supports horrendous abuses committed by Washington and its imperial allies. Submit your review

in: Preparedness\Survival , US News Darned if we do and darned if we don't. That basically sums up the current election cycle. I'd go so far as to say that everybody loses during this election, especially if the promised chaos erupts when the winner is announced. Regardless of which candidate 'wins” the presidential election, I have a bad feeling about the aftermath. I think we could be on the cusp of the most widespread civil unrest since the Civil War. If you are interested in getting prepared for it but don't want to read over all of the frightening possibilities, go here and sign up for a Prepping Crash Course that will help you be ready for impending chaos in a mere 24 hours. For those who are wondering how things might go down, let's look at some scenarios. If Trump wins… There is so much anti-Trump wrath among Progressives that violence has already erupted at campaign rallies. Trump supporters had eggs and bottles thrown at them in San Jose , a police car was smashed and nearly 20 were arrested at a violent protest in Orange County, and a man was even arrested for trying to grab a police officer's gun to assassinate Trump . And look at what Clintonites did to this homeless woman who was trying to protect Donald Trump's star from being further defaced on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. YouTube Notice how many of these mob-minded cowards it took to terrorise one homeless woman…Classy, right? Now, think about how these people will react if Trump is somehow elected. If you have a sign in your yard, you will be a target for their rage. Got a Trump/Pence sticker on your car? Expect that it could be defaced. Even more recently, Penn State students were 'triggered” by a pro-Trump rally and began tearing down signs, swearing at the pro-Trump kids, and disrupting their event. What's more, it isn't just Social Justice Warriors and Progressives folks would need to worry about. A top activist in the group, Black Lives Matter, took to Twitter to inform everyone exactly what would happen if Trump were to win the presidency. This was deleted but is archived here . The tweet was followed by this one, which is still u p… Don't delude yourself. With a Trump victory, trouble is coming. And don't think living in a small town keeps you safe. The population of Ferguson, Missouri is barely over 20,000 people – hardly a metropolis. If Clinton wins… With the newly intensified investigation into her corruptio n, it hardly seems possible that she could still win this election, but her supporters seem blind to the crimes she has committed. Instead of looking at the facts, they're saying 'First woman president YA !!!” With all of the collusion , it seems like the FBI is fighting a tough battle to see her indicted. There once was a day that this suspicion would be enough to keep the American people from voting for a person who is blatantly in it for she can personally gain. The Wikileaks email scandal continues, with new revelations about our government leading to possible criminal proceedings, impeachment and heaven only knows what else. As well, there's a very, very good chance that the election will be rigged . Somehow, despite all that is going on, Clinton's campaign is still planning her celebratory fireworks party , scheduled to start several hours before all the votes could even be counted. If this happens, Trump supporters will be enraged – and justifiably so. Joe Walsh, a former congressman, has already tweeted he's 'grabbing his musket.” And Walsh is not alone. Many Americans are sick and tired of the blatant, in-our-faces corruption. There is talk of revolution and even a quiet counter-coup going on behind the scenes. Others concur that unrest is coming. I'm not the only blogger out here in Bloggerland who thinks all hell will break loose regardless of who becomes presidents. Mike Adams of Natural News wrote , 'My ANALYSIS of possible outcomes from the upcoming presidential election reveals that America only has a 5% chance of remaining peaceful after November 8. This does not mean the violence will occur on November 9th, but rather that events will be set into motion on that day which will lead to an escalation of violence (95% chance…) Check out his predictions of the possible scenarios . And from the more liberal side of the unrest coin, an essayist for Cracked.com still comes to a similar conclusion. 'Over the last few weeks a growing number of people have started wondering, 'Is it possible the United States is heading for a new civil war?”…Every time I wanted to dismiss those headlines I thought about my visit to Ukraine last year, to cover their ongoing civil war . The most common sentence I heard was, 'It's like a bad dream.” Up to the minute the shooting started, almost no one thought civil war was a serious possibility.” You need to get prepped. Immediately. What it all boils down to is that we need to be prepared. We need to be ready for any unrest that comes about as a direct result of the election – and I really believe that there will be some form of uprising against the result. I hope it will be nothing more than a few minor, isolated incidents, but I can't get past the niggling feeling that all hell is just about to break loose. November 7 could be the last day of normalcy for quite some time. The governments of Germany and the Czech Republic have told their citizens to stock up on food, water and basic survival supplies in case of a national emergency. We need to be doing the same. If you would like to take a class to help you prepare for this, you can learn more here. If you don't want to invest in a class, use this FREE handy checklist to make sure you'll have everything you need. Post-Election Chaos Checklist Make sure everything is in order. While it's unlikely that services like internet, electricity, and municipal water will be affected, it doesn't hurt to be ready for that possibility. The key here is to make certain you don't have to leave your home for the duration of the unrest, should it come your way. Check your pantry and fill any gaps in your food preps. Order emergency food buckets – if you order right away there is still time to get them before the election.

in: Collapse , Economy & Business , Multimedia In the following interview, Elijah Johnson and Silver Doctors bring you the latest interview with someone we haven't heard from in a while, Dr. Jim Willie. To begin the financial portion of the interview, Elijah begins by asking Dr. Willie about the unprecedented bond dumping by China and Saudi Arabia, and of course what Elijah is referring to is how several weeks ago the markets witnessed never before seen numbers when $28 billion in U.S. Treasuries were dumped one week, followed by another $23 billion a week or so later. 
Consider the massive sell-off's just further evidence in a long line of existing examples regarding why the days of the U.S. Dollar as the World Reserve Currency are numbered. Our creditors are aware that the Fed has been engaged in non-stop printing of money out of thin air, and even though the short-term effect has been the propping up of U.S. Treasury prices, our creditors know history, something Americans seems to pay no attention to. Our creditors know that just like other countries who have engaged in the same kinds of reckless monetary policy in the past, eventually when the QE (printing money out of thin air), is removed, hyperinflation will set in, and there will be massive devaluation of the same Treasuries that were artificially propped up for so long. Most creditors expect the QE to be shut off the moment this U.S. election is over, because unlike uninformed American voters, our creditors know that In addition to his role in allowing the largest case of massive voter fraud in America history to take place on his watch, Captain Transparency in the White House has made sure his loyal servant at the Fed, Janet Yellen, has continued committing massive financial fraud at the Fed at the same time. All of these actions by the U.S. result in what Dr. Willie refers to as psychological damage not just to the full faith and credit of the United States Dollar, but to the United States itself. Creditors of U.S. debt are watching a never before seen transition in the U.S. to a system of pure corruption, undermining ANY faith they might have had in the Dollar, and giving them every reason in the world to want to distance them from the U.S. Dollar. Dr. Willie explains that any 'perceived” moral authority the U.S. once might have had is long gone. Among other things, the world learned not long ago through a shocking revelation by Wikileaks that Obama and Hillary not only knew of funds being used to provide ISIS (our enemy), with weapons during a time of war, the world has now seen that Barack Obama and Hillary allowed it. With almost a week until the official election we have heard tremendous stories of voter fraud including stories revealing as many as 20/20 examples of machines switching votes from Trump to Hillary, we know the polls have been massively rigged, and thanks to a national media as corrupt and dishonest and those they are tasked with watching over, Dr. Willie briefly mentions millennials who were recently highlighted on the Steven Colbert show expressing their excitement that Obamacare premiums are doubling in some states. The level of stupidity that is coming out of liberal indoctrination centers known as public schools or universities, where graduates have no ability to exercise critical thinking skills, is exactly why 20% college graduates are now living with their parents or grandparents, and Michael Snyder explains below. Expect that number to keep climbing considerably, particularly with a Clinton Presidency. Michael Snyder writes: In America today, more than 60 million people live in multi-generational households. That number is so large that it may seem difficult to believe, but the truth is that vast numbers of young adults have had to move back in with their parents and grandparents in recent years due to the deteriorating economy . Millions of our young people cannot find decent jobs once they leave school, and millions of them are absolutely overwhelmed by debt. Of course some of them are just lazy, but whatever the reason it is undeniable that multi-generational households are on the rise. According to the Pew Research Center , 12 percent of the U.S. population was living in multi-generational households back in 1980. Today, that number is up to 19 percent. That means nearly one out of every five U.S. adults now live with their parents or their grandparents. One of the big culprits, of course, is student loan debt.

in: Multimedia , Politics (image: Gage Skidmore) Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall (King James Bible). Throughout recorded history, hubris has been the Achilles' Heel of political despots. Hillary Clinton and her political crime machine has been operating above the law for decades, stretching back at least to when Bill Clinton was Governor of Arkansas. 'Hillary Clinton is a toilet scrubber for Goldman Sachs” – John Titus on the Shadow of Truth During her 2016 Presidential Campaign, it became routine for her get in front the public and lie with convincing ease. In Greek tragedy, 'hubris” was an anti-hero's excessive pride toward or defiance of the gods, leading to the character's unforeseen demise. When Hillary was deposed by the FBI about the 33,000 emails on her private server that were wiped clean forever using BleachBit, she assumed her tracks were irrevocably covered up. But it wasn't just 33,000 emails that were incinerated, reams of evidence including laptops, server back-ups and Blackberries either 'disappeared” or were wiped clean. But out of the blue, as if sent to earth from a Higher Power, the FBI in its child pornography investigation of Anthony Weiner stumbled on to a laptop with 650,000 emails that appeared to have been downloaded from Hillary Clinton's private server. It is highly probable that among this treasure trough of emails will be copies of the 33,000 emails that Hillary arrogantly assumed were wiped from the Universe. Hubris gets 'em every time. But it gets better than that. 650,000 is decade's worth of emails. It's also possible that Weiner's laptop will finally shed the light of Truth on Benghazi.

When I was reading the news this morning, I discovered a quote that was so very ironic, I wanted to think that it was satire. But it wasn't. The Clinton campaign, who really liked the FBI during their first go-round , had the audacity to say now that the FBI has double standards. 'It is impossible to view this as anything less than a blatant double standard,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said. He also called on Mr Comey to 'immediately explain this incongruence and apply the same standard to Donald Trump's associates as he has applied to Hillary Clinton's.” ( source ) BWHAHAHA. LOL. ROTFL. Excuse me, I can't stop laughing…a nervous, manic kind of laughter that also makes one of my eyes twitch. Why? This is coming from the spokesperson of a woman who is trying to pull in young voters and calling them 'F*&$ing dumb” behind their backs. This is coming from the spokesperson of a woman who is trying to connect with the American people at the same time as saying she has no clue about real life due to her background. This is coming from the spokesperson of a woman who preaches honesty and integrity and practices neither, saying in a paid speech that sometimes you have to lie. I have never heard a more ridiculous, two-faced audacious comment in my whole life. And considering I write about politics, I've heard a lot over the years. Speaking of double standards, did you hear the latest about the re-opened email investigation? The incestuous connection between the Clinton campaign and the Department of Justice continues. The person in charge of the new investigation is none other than Peter Kadzik. Kadzik has a long history with both the Clinton family and campaign manager John Podesta. Podesta wrote ' The Power of Progress” in 2008, in which he outlined his plan to save the world. And by longtime connections, I mean… Kadzik represented John Podesta after he perjured himself during the Monica Lewinsky case Kadzik lobbied for Marc Rich, a fugitive that was pardoned by then-President Bill Clinton Kadzik led the effort to nominate Loretta Lynch as Attorney General Kadzik had a celebratory dinner with Podesta the day after the Benghazi hearings Kadzik denied a request from Republicans to appoint special counsel in the last Clinton email investigation Kadzik and Podesta appear from Wikileaks to be the best of friends, celebrating birthdays and other occasions together Those are some of the links between Kadzik and Clintonland – check out this very thorough report on Zero Hedge for all of the details. Can you imagine the hue and cry if Donald Trump's nearest and dearest ran the investigation about his alleged links with Russia? How is this possibly okay? Open letter to Peter Kadzik After stumbling across Kadzik's email address in an online group (by the way, it's [email protected] – don't they every learn about email security?) I sent this very polite email suggesting that he recuse himself from the investigation. Dear Mr. Kadzik: When I learned that you were to be the person in charge of the investigation into Huma Abedin and her emails, I was curious to learn about your connections. With just a teeny tiny bit of Googling, I was aghast to discover that you have a close friendship with John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager.I was further discomfited by the fact that you have direct connections with the Obamas and the Clintons themselves. While I'm sure you take your job very seriously, it seems to me a direct conflict of interest for you to handle this investigation. I strongly urge you to do the right thing and recuse yourself from overseeing this investigation. If you find the emails without merit, there was always be a cloud over your findings due to your close connections with the Clintons, President Obama, and Mrs. Clinton's campaign. Please hand this over to independent investigators who can do this job without the appearance of bias. Sincerely, Daisy Luther Surprisingly, I've had no response to my courteous request. He's probably out there busily finding a non-biased replacement. Article first posted at DaisyLuther.com Submit your review

in: Government Corruption , Special Interests , US News The cross section of Hillary Clinton voters is a mixture of walking dead zombies, power hungry influence peddlers, money cartel thieves and establishment diehards willing to start a global confrontation to postpone an inevitable economic collapse. As for the first category; welfare recipients, government bootlickers and mentally deranged utopians survive in a subsistence existence or in a fantasy illusion. The corruption purveyors simply want to maintain their elitist system of institutional inequality. As for the tribe of international finance, their objective always remains the same. Pick the next stooge who can be controlled. Finally, for globalist who are frantic to continue their New World Order of worldwide oppression, the elevation of Hillary Clinton to the position of the mad hatter to achieve the mutual assured destruction that these Illuminati's masters of the universe require to purge the 'Little People” from the planet. Any opposition to this band of desperate and deranged desperados is portrayed as racist, xenophobic and defiant of the 'Politically Correct” secular humanism culture. Here is the fundamental point of the conflict. The abandonment of the cannons of natural and common law has produced a didactic ineptness that thrusts humanity into a technocratic prison of a meaningless existence. Dante's Inferno of basic extinction is the ultimate society that a capitulation to the rigged electoral fraud seeks to achieve. The bloody record of Killary Clinton earns her an especially prominent place in hell. Take your choice. She may descend into Level 7 , for 'The violent, the assasins, the tyrants, and the war-mongers lament their pitiless mischiefs in the river, while centaurs armed with bows and arrows shoot those who try to escape their punishment” or Level 8- the Malebolge where 'The magicians, diviners, fortune tellers, and panderers are all here, as are the thieves”. Of course this allegory of punishment falls on deaf ears for the Clintonistas . For them this blameless role model for social justice warriors can do no wrong. All the evidence and proof in the world is ignored or dismissed when your patron saint of the occult wears pants suits. The reason HRC is better known as Killary has a lot to do with the body count that follows her around. THE CLINTON BODY-COUNT and the 'CLINTON DEATH LIST': 33 SPINE-TINGLING CASES lists several of her enemies that dared defy the queen of mean. Now are these suspicious circumstances of such deaths just another right-wing conspiracy to bring down the Arkancide crime syndicate? To an objective investigator, engaging into an in-depth probe might just get one added to this long list. But why would a Clinton supporter care, she is the epitome of the liberated woman and placing her on the throne of feminism is far overdue. Accepting, if not savoring a little reign of terror is a small price to pay as long as the body count does not include your own person. During the French Revolution the sanguinary women, known as Tricoteuse, who sat and knitted while attending public guillotine executions have more in common with Robespierre than Marie Antoinette. These devotee libbers identified with the symbol of equality, while their crowned head of elitism disdainfully admonish the peasants: 'Qu'ils mangent de la brioche”. Queen Marie Antoinette may not have really said, 'Let them eat cake” but the regnant of the House of Clinton demonstrates throughout her entire life revealed her true sentiments; despise and contempt for the 'Little People”. The knitting culture of the zombies cult of progressive authoritarianism is at the center of the public psychosis that follows the dictates of Hillary Clinton. Their identity is so caught up in the myth of collectivism that the very spirit of individual liberty is a necessary causality to join the Clinton demon worship. Look to the fictional character of Madame Defarge penned in A Tale of Two Cities for a synopsis of all that is wrong with Killary and her followers. Charles Dickens presents this viewpoint of the quintessential monster. 'Her problem, it seems, is that Madame Defarge just doesn't know where to draw the line. As far as she's concerned, 'justice” for the fate of her family isn't just that the Marquis gets murdered. Justice should, she thinks, include the 'extermination” of all of the Marquis's family. Given her druthers, Charles, Lucie, and even little Lucie would fall under the sharp blade of La Guillotine. As Madame Defarge exclaims to her husband, 'Tell the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!” (3.12.36). 'It was nothing to her that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself.” (3.14.33) So it comes as no surprise that when 'The meeting between Lucie and Madame Defarge makes this absolutely clear: Lucie falls on her knees, begging for mercy on behalf of her child. Madame Defarge stares at her coldly. She doesn't even stop knitting.” This example of the dark side of human nature is particularly relevant and applicable when analyzing the gender iniquity of the wicked witch. For femininity enablement to champion such abuse from a coldhearted degenerate is the biggest disappointment of this election cycle. Society should never condone or provide consent for anyone, male or female; who is such a habitual sociopath. The influence hucksters do not pretend to be altruistic . They would support Lucifer if they thought they would gain the riches of this world. As for the money changers, they are already archfiends in the Synagogue of Satan. Lastly, the globalist's warmongers covet the mass eradication of billions to satisfy their lust for world transcendence. These three factions are the true irredeemables. The masses of the walking dead need to politically repent and seek civic redemption. This objective is not possible by voting for Hillary Clinton. If you do nothing else before the November 8, 2016 election watch the video, A Vote For Hillary is a Vote For World War 3 . No matter your ideological propensities, we all share a mutual objective. Prevent a nuclear war that will destroy all civilized life on the planet. After watching this presentation, every rational person must come to deal with the prospects of putting a psycho in command of the launch codes. Folks; Donald Trump is not the mad man. The schizoid is a systemic and immoral lunatic, who is ready to drop the beheading blade on all of America. Her similarity with Madame Defarge bleeds over to her decadent boosters, who are willing to sacrifice their family, friends and community for the joy of destroying our planet. For all the dissatisfied and frustrated citizens, who understand the colossal stakes of national survival intervene with any fellow acquaintance that has been indoctrinated to the propaganda of Hillaryland . Confront the zombies attitude and appeal to their individual self-interest. Put forth the prospect of not voting for Clinton, even if Trump would not be an option. Citizens will not be the only people voting. Non eligible people are being ushered into a ballot booth with predisposed programming to put Killary into the oval office. The establishment is revealing their real tyranny for any person, who is still alive and has the ability to assess the actual nature of this election. The power structure in ready to collapse and the global elites are prepared to start a world war to keep and protect their feudal system of coercion. Those who might survive will be the special and the anointed. The masses will be served up on the plate of expediency and necessity. Hillary Clinton has always been part of the gang of criminals, protected by the intelligence community, insider politicians and the legal system of corrupt lawyers and judges. Voting for her is a clear validation of pure mental illness. The fact that the discredited FBI is endeavoring to regain their credibility by reopening the criminal investigation into Killary Clinton's attempt to hide her family's pay to play scheme to sell out our country is dramatic. This development should provide ample reason to put any notion of voting for the diva of sleaze on hold. Thanks to the Wikileaks release of the illicit emails from the Clinton cabal, only a fool can vote for her. Come to grips with the prospects of knowingly elevating this lifelong criminal to become the commander-and-chief. Genuine national security cannot be scarified to allow a distrustful and compromised agent of foreign interests to become President. Killary is dead meat. She could never gain the confidence of the nation and her continued nihilistic conduct and her kleptocrat criminal violations cannot be tolerated or ignored any longer. If you really want to save the planet, you cannot cast your ballot for this known traitor.

in: Natural Medicine For those who cannot or simply wish not to take chemical drugs for menstrual pain (dysmenorrhea), a time-tested and now clinically confirmed natural alternative exists based on the flavorful herb fennel. In a recent double-blinded, cross-over study published in Iranian Journal of Nursery and Midwifery Research, involving 68 female university students (mean age 21.8 years), the participants were divided into two groups of 34 and randomly administered either a combination of fennel/vitamin E or ibuprofen for two months. [i] Up to 60.3% of the subjects in the trial had missed school or daily activities due to dysmenorrhea, 89.7% participants reported use of tranquilizers, and 22.1% had family history of dysmenorrhea. Additionally, a pre-study survey (2007) on a dysmenorrheic population in Tehran found that 95.7% of the participants reported using another drug for pain relief in the case group and about 95.5% used these drugs in the control group. [ii] The results of the intervention were reported as follows: 'The mean of peak pain intensity in the first, second, third, sixth, and forty-eighth hours in the group that had used combination of fennel extract/vitamin E was lower than the group that had used ibuprofen, and statistical differences were observed between the two groups in the first and second hours; combination of fennel extract/vitamin E was more effective than ibuprofen in the first hour ( P < 0.03) and second hour ( P < 0.04). The mean of peak pain intensity in the first, second, third, sixth, and forty-eighth hours in the group that had used combination of fennel extract/vitamin E was lower than the group that had used ibuprofen, and statistical differences were observed between the two groups in the first and second hours; combination of fennel extract/vitamin E was more effective than ibuprofen in the first hour ( P < 0.03) and second hour ( P < 0.04).” The study concluded, 'Combination of fennel extract/vitamin E is effective on decreasing the intensity of pain of primary dysmenorrhea, and it is advised to those who cannot use chemical drugs.” Beyond the obvious pain and quality of life issues of painful menstrual cycles, it has been estimated that in the United States alone, missed work due to dysmenorrhea leads to 600 million work hours per year, with economic loses are an estimated $2 billion per year. [iii] Unfortunately, there are severe side effects associated with conventional treatment for dysmenorrhea, which rely mostly on painkillers, and whose wide range of deleterious effects include liver damage ( Tylenol ), bleeding disorders ( aspirin / ibuprofen ), and severe addiction (opioids), to name but a few of over 100 known adverse health effects of this drug class. [iv] In a recent article, ' Ibuprofen Kills Thousands Each Year, So What is the Alternative? ” we discussed the fallout from a recent Lancet article indicating the risk of heart attack increases as much as a third and the risk of heart failure doubles among heavier users of NSAID drugs. Given how common the use is of chemical drugs for this common health complaint, the fennel/vitamin E's comparable potency is quite encouraging. While the fennel/vitamin E trial did not disclose the exact formula and dosages of ingredients used, a previous trial found that fennel seed (technically a fruit) extract at 2% concentration (25 drops, orally every 4 waking hours) compared favorably to another NSAID drug known as mefenamic acid. [v] These are not the only two trials comparing fennel to a drug in the treatment of dysmenorrhea. Previous published studies include: Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal (2006): Two groups of high school girls with dysmenorrhea received either fennel extract or mefenamic acid for 2 months, resulting in comparable levels of pain relief and recovery of functional activity. [vi] Ayu (2012): 60 adolescent girls suffering from dysmenorrhea received either 30mg of fennel extract, four times a day for three days from start of their menstrual period or a placebo a capsule in the same dosage scheme. The fennel intervention was more effective than the placebo group in pain relief. [vii] Iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research (2013) : 60 college students with dysmenorrhea were randomly assigned to two groups, one with fennel drops (2% fennel extract, 25 drops every 6 hours) and the other with mefenamic acid (250 mg every 6 hours). The pain relief was comparable between groups. [viii] [Note: the researchers observed increased bleeding in the fennel group. Those prone to this should exercise additional caution]. Fennel is one of a wide range of traditional herbs used to address symptoms of dysmenorrhea.

in: Government , Multimedia , Special Interests November 8th's election in the United States is perhaps the most important ever in the history of the country. It is not just an election to choose a President and some Senators and Representatives, it is perhaps the last true election that Americans will see. There is much more than just voting at stake. There are issues that are much more important than selecting judges for the Supreme Court. The election of 2016 may be the culmination of what previous American presidents warned: an internal takeover for the complete destruction of the country. Apparently, the attempt to, once a for all, strip Americans away from their Constitutional Rights has already been noticed by members of the intelligence community, who have launched a counter coup to stop the big American takeover led by Hillary and Bill Clinton. 'Hillary and Bill Clinton are attempting a takeover of the United States and will stop at nothing,” warns former US government official, Steve Pieczenik. 'A coup d'état of this magnitude has never been affected in such a subtly calculated way,” he explains in a video posted on his account on Youtube. In his video, Pieczenik explains that the Coup in which the Clintons are participating has been done silently and via the use of two methods: corruption and co-optation. 'The Clintons have been involved in co-opting our White House, our Judiciary, our CIA, our Federal Bureau of Investigation, our Attorney General Loretta Lynch and our Director of the FBI, James Comey,” Pieczenik says. He says that the people and organizations cited above were made part of a group that was directed through political cronyism. Pieczenik says that him and other former members of the intelligence community have now launched a counter coup operation with the collaboration of Julian Assange and Wikileaks. The former government official announced that the revelation of new emails contained in a laptop computer that belonged to Anthony Weiner was the first step, the first warning, that the counter coup had started. Speaking directly to those who he believes are carrying out the Coup d'Etat against the American people, Pieczenik said: 'We are going to stop you from making Hillary the president of the United States.” He also announced that his group would indict the president of the United States, Loretta Lynch and others who, according to Pieczenik, are involved in the cover-up of the massive corruption going on at the Clinton Foundation.

in: Politics , Special Interests What happens when you get thousands of lawyers involved in the craziest election in modern American history? Unfortunately, we may be about to find out. We all remember the legal tug of war between Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000, and with each passing day it is becoming more likely that we could see something similar (or even worse) in 2016. In a brand new article entitled ' Clinton, Trump Prepare for Possibility of Election Overtime ', Bloomberg discusses the armies of lawyers that Clinton and Trump are both assembling for this election. It would be nice if it was the American people that actually decided the outcome of this election, but if things are very close on November 8th it may come down to what the courts decide. Traditionally, there has been a lot of pressure on the losing candidate to concede to the winning candidate before election night is over. However, in recent elections this has begun to change. I already mentioned what took place in the aftermath of the 2000 election, and in 2004 John Kerry did not concede to George W. Bush until the next morning. And looking back at the numbers from the 2012 election, it is clear that Mitt Romney should not have conceded the race to Barack Obama so early. There was evidence of election fraud in key battleground states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Colorado and Virginia , and many people out there still believe that Mitt Romney would have won if the election would have been conducted fairly. So when Donald Trump says that he may not immediately concede the election if the results are tight, I think that there is wisdom in that. A couple of weeks ago, it looked like we may have had a situation where Hillary Clinton could have won by a landslide . But the FBI changed everything when they announced that they were renewing their investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. Since that announcement, the poll numbers have been rapidly shifting and now Trump has all of the momentum . For example, the ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll had Hillary Clinton up by double digits not too long ago, but now it is showing a one point lead for Trump . The race is very close at this point, and if the race to 270 electoral votes is razor tight on election night, I don't anticipate that either candidate will be eager to concede. We could see a prolonged legal battle ensue, and that could mean that we don't have a new president until long after election day is over. Already, both campaigns are assembling large armies of lawyers. In fact, Bloomberg is reporting that Clinton already has 'thousands of lawyers” that have donated their time to her campaign… Clinton is assembling a voter protection program that has drawn thousands of lawyers agreeing to lend their time and expertise in battleground states, though the campaign isn't saying exactly how many or where. It is readying election observers in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada and Arizona to assess any concerns — including the potential for voter intimidation — and to verify normal procedures. The Republican National Lawyers Association, which trains attorneys in battleground states and in local jurisdictions where races are expected to be close, aims to assemble 1,000 lawyers ready to monitor polls and possibly challenge election results across the country. Hedge fund manager Robert Mercer, one of Trump's biggest backers, has sunk $500,000 into the group, its biggest donation in at least four presidential elections, Internal Revenue Service filings show. And most Americans don't realize this, but Reuters is reporting that the Democrats have already filed election-related lawsuits in four key swing states… Democratic Party officials sued Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in four battleground states on Monday, seeking to shut down a poll-watching effort they said was designed to harass minority voters in the Nov. 8 election . In lawsuits filed in federal courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona and Ohio, Democrats argued that Trump and Republican Party officials were mounting a 'campaign of vigilante voter intimidation” that violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and an 1871 law aimed at the Ku Klux Klan. Meanwhile, the legal challenges for the Clinton campaign continue to mount. The renewed investigation into Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified documents is just one of five FBI investigations that are currently looking into the conduct of 'Clinton's inner circle” … There are, in fact, not one but five separate FBI investigations which involve members of Clinton's inner circle or their closest relatives – the people at the center of what has come to be known as Clintonworld. The five known investigations are into: Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedin's estranged husband sexting a 15-year-old; the handling of classified material by Clinton and her staff on her private email server; questions over whether the Clinton Foundation was used as a front for influence-peddling; whether the Virginia governor broke laws about foreign donations; and whether Hillary's campaign chairman's brother did the same. Despite everything that we already know about Hillary, about half the country still plans to vote for her. If the American people willingly choose to elect the most corrupt presidential candidate in our history, it may be a sign that the events that I talk about in my new book are a lot closer than many people had originally been anticipating. But the good news is that a Clinton victory is looking a whole lot less likely than it was just a week or two ago. Could it be possible that the FBI has just delivered the ' miracle ” that Donald Trump desperately needed? Americans are more emotionally invested in this presidential campaign than they have been in any presidential campaign since at least 1980. Many of those that are backing Trump will be emotionally devastated if he does not win on November 8th, but if Trump does win we are likely to see the radical left throw a political temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Earlier today, I shared with my readers the amazing fact that Donald Trump would be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old during his first full day in the White House if he wins the election. Many conservatives are fully convinced that it is Donald Trump's destiny to be president. Personally, I do not know what is going to happen. But with a race this close, it may be the courts that end up deciding who our next president is, and that is an outcome that none of us should want to see. Submit your review

in: Government , Petitions , Special Interests The rigged investigation into the new batch of Hillary Clinton-related emails just got epically more rigged. Well, the folks doing research over at Zero Hedge have completely outdone themselves with this discovery that will never reach the mainstream. 'Ironically”, that is the same Peter Kadzik who has proven his 'impartiality” in multiple WikiLeaks emails including this newly released bombshell in which Kadzik provides a very helpful 'heads up” about Hillary's email server investigation. This is what Kadzik emailed to John Podesta (via gmail) on May 19, 2015: There is a HJC oversight hearing today where the head of our Civil Division will testify. Likely to get questions on State Department emails. Another filing in the FOIA case went in last night or will go in this am that indicates it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails. Perhaps Mr. Kadzik could explain to our readers – and the American public – why this particular message was delivered via his private, gmail account rather than his official DOJ email account? Go and r ead the article to learn of Kadzik's background . It's positively incestuous with ties to the Clintons and Podestas. Here's what you can do. Contact the Department of Justice. Be civil because screaming, swearing, and threatening never accomplished anything. Let them know that you want to see an independent investigation into these emails and into the Clinton Foundation. Let them know that you will also be contacting your local media to make them aware of this conflict of interest. Here is the contact information for the DoJ. Make phone calls and send emails.

In no way does this reflect well on the DoJ. It's an insult to the American people that this blatant collusion is allowed and presented as 'justice.” This is especially appalling considering this email he sent Podesta during the last investigation with the subject line 'Heads up” https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/43150 I will be notifying my local media of this debacle and sharing it everywhere I can reach via social media. People are learning of this collusion rapidly – you might want to read this article published on Zero Hedge and put on the front page of the Drudge Report – keeping in mind that Drudge gets millions of page views per day and is one of the biggest websites in America. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-02/more-collusion-between-clinton-campaign-and-doj-kadzik-provides-heads-podesta The American people don't trust the government anymore, and it is actions like this, putting John Podesta's close friend in charge of an investigation that all eyes are on, that is like spitting in the face of every person in America who hopes that justice is indeed blind, even when the recipient of it is Hillary Rodham Clinton. Please do the right thing. This investigation needs to be independent of anyone with ties to the Clintons and any figure in their campaign. Sincerely, If you use social media, get on it.

in: Politics , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests Well, everyone thought it was a sure thing — Hillary Clinton had the White House in the bag; the entire political system from the DNC to the RNC and the mainstream media had already called the election over and done. Online gambling sites listed Clinton as a sure bet and Irish site Paddy Power even paid out one million dollars on the assumption of a Clinton win. And then, one Weiner ruined everything — Anthony Weiner. The revelation of an October surprise re-opening of the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's misuse of classified data on private and vulnerable email servers does not come as a shock to me, but it certainly does to many people around the world. Hundreds of mainstream outlets are scrambling to spin the news as misconduct by the FBI rather than a victory for the halls of justice. Numerous alternative media analysts are rushing to cover their butts and admit that there is now a 'chance” of a Trump win. Confusion reigns supreme as the weirdest election in U.S. history continues to bewilder observers. The first issue that needs to be addressed is the lack of an open mind displayed by some when it comes to the real purpose behind this election. The second issue here, of course, is one of timing. Through the majority of this election cycle the public consensus has been that Clinton will win. Some argued that Trump would not be able to compete with the leftist media empire standing against him, while others have argued that the entire system including the Republican establishment would ensure that Trump would fail. The alternative media has in the past simply pointed out that elections have always been rigged, either by the elites playing both sides of the competition, or through outright voter fraud. They have assumed that the elites want Clinton, and therefore, the election has already been decided. I tend to agree with the latter point of view, though I disagree with the conclusion. U.S. elections are indeed controlled, and have been for decades, primarily through the false left/right paradigm. However, as I have been pointing out since I correctly predicted the success of the Brexit referendum, I don't think that Clinton is the choice of the elites. I outline my reasons for this conclusion in-depth in articles like '2016 Will End With Economic Instability And A Trump Presidency' , published in August. For the past several months it seems as though I have been the only person holding the view that Trump will be president. Only in the past few days have I received emails from readers stating that they used to think I was probably crazy, but now they aren't so sure… To be clear, my position is that Trump is slated to take the White House and that this is by design. This has been my position since before Trump won the Republican Primaries, it was my position when the election cycle began, it has never changed, nor have my views on the reasons for this outcome ever changed. Of course, the election is not over yet, and if Clinton ends up soiling the already thoroughly soiled Oval Office with her presence, then everyone can color me confused as well. That said, here are some issues that I think many people are overlooking when coming to conclusions on the election and the events surrounding it. Clinton Is The Worst Candidate The Elites Could Have Chosen I have been studying the activities and behaviors of establishment elites for over a decade and I have to say… they are not stupid. They certainly have hubris, and I would not call them 'wise,” but they are definitely devious. They know how to rig a game. They know how to play both sides. They know how to cheat to get what they want when it comes to politics and how to manufacture consent from portions of the public. They've been doing it a long time. They have mastered it. So, in my view it is rather insane for the elites to field a candidate such as Hillary Clinton IF the entirety of their globalist empire hangs in the balance (I don't think it does). Though she is fond of BleachBit, the woman is unbleachable. With a decades-long rap sheet from her work at Rose Law Firm (in which document destruction and 'misplacement” was apparently routine) to her interference with investigations into Bill Clinton's sexual indiscretions, to the strange odyssey surrounding her lies on the Benghazi attack, as well as her rampant mishandling of classified documents as head of the State Department, not to mention the Clinton Foundation's pay to play scandals, it is impossible to endear her to the masses. Her dismal crowd turnouts are rather indicative of this. On top of all this, Clinton's anti-Russia rhetoric is coming off as absolutely crazy, and I think this is by design. Many in the alternative media, while assuming that Clinton is paving the way for WWIII, forget that the average person may not be up to speed on the same information we are, but most of them aren't ignorant. Clinton's ravings on Russian hacking and potential war are even putting liberals off rather than inspiring their confidence. One would think that if the elites have their veritable pick of any politician to represent their interests in the White House and convince the American public to go along for the ride, Clinton would be the worst choice. Even if the intention were to rig the election in favor of Clinton, she would be a lame-duck president the second she took office, and, her mere presence would galvanize conservatives to the point of mass rebellion. This is not generally how the elites play the game. Instead, they prefer co-option to direct confrontation. Which President Is Better For The Elites During An Economic Breakdown? If you consider the premise that Clinton is NOT the chosen one, and that the entire election is theater, the situation changes rather drastically. Those that follow the underlying economic data that the mainstream tends to ignore know that large swaths of the global financial system are not long for this world. With Europe's banking system plunging towards a Lehman-style event, the OPEC production freeze deal ready to fall apart yet again, and the Federal Reserve threatening to raise rates into recessionary conditions in December, our already floundering fiscal structure is approaching another crisis. My questions has always been who would the elites rather have in office when this crisis occurs? I've said it a hundred times before and I'll say it again here: with Clinton in office, globalists and international financiers get the blame for any economic downturn. With Trump in office, conservative movements will be blamed. In fact, I suggest anyone who doubts this scenario watch stock market reactions every time Trump rises in the polls or Clinton faces renewed scandal. The narrative is already being prepared — a Trump win equals a market loss. For those that think it outlandish that the public could be tricked into blaming Trump and conservatives for an economic crisis, I suggest they consider that possession is nine-tenths of the law in the minds of many. People can also be irrational when facing financial ruin. I would remind readers that history is written by the victors. The globalists plan to be victorious in the dismantling of America and our founding principles. Whether or not they succeed is really up to average conservatives and liberty proponents, not Trump. The FBI's Move Prepares The Way For Trump Clinton and the DNC argue that FBI Director James Comey's announcement of a re-opened investigation is politically motivated. And they are right, sort of. The real motivation, I believe, is that Clinton was never meant to win the election in the first place, and that the elites want Trump placed in power during the final hours of the U.S. economy. Everything else is just a Kabuki dance. The democrats are crying foul and accusing Comey of 'working with Putin,” or working with the alt-right. The nefarious Harry Reid has even accused the FBI of hiding Trump's supposed ties to the Russian government and violating the Hatch Act. I think much of this outrage is real, as I believe much of the mainstream media attacks on Trump are coming from people who really think they are waging a propaganda war to get Hillary Clinton elected. This, however, does not mean that the elites plan to install Clinton. Some might see my position as bizarre. I understand. But equally bizarre to me are some of the rationalizations people attempt to argue when dealing with the Comey revelation. For example, the argument that the entire re-opening of the investigation is a complex ploy designed by the establishment to distract away from the Wikileaks data dumps. This makes little sense. If anything, the re-opening investigation is only bringing MORE attention to the Wikileaks data, not less. If the elites were hoping to create a distraction, they failed miserably. The FBI's announcement ONLY harms the Clinton campaign. Period. Even if it fizzles out, even if they announce that nothing was found, the investigation hitting the news streams so close to election day refocuses all public attention back on Clinton's corruption and will continue to do so for the next week at least. The idea that the elites hope to use it to help Clinton is nonsensical. I have also seen the argument that Comey is acting to cover his own posterior, perhaps because of a fear that Trump may steal away a victory. I find this equally absurd. Months back the consensus among alternative analysts was that Comey (placed in the FBI by Obama) was a traitor and the FBI was a puppet agency of the establishment. Now, suddenly, Comey is worried about a possible Trump win and so takes an action which might self-fulfill the prophecy? Comey does what he is told. The FBI is an owned and operated elitist franchise. They do not go rogue. If the rogue FBI narrative were true and Comey actually feels the need to cover his bases with Trump, then it is only because he knows something the rest of us do not. With Clinton in office, his goose would be cooked after this little incident. Comey only gains an advantage if Trump is slated to win. Trump May Or May Not Be Aware Of The Plan The bottom line, according to the evidence I have seen in terms of elitists influence over U.S. elections, is that if Trump wins it will only be because they wanted him to win. The FBI firestorm this past week appears to support my view and we still have another week left for further Clinton ugliness to be revealed. I also expect that if Trump wins, the reaction from conservatives and liberty activists will be that the event was a 'miracle,” a shocking upset against the establishment. Much like the reaction to the Brexit referendum. I continue to hold that conservatives and sovereignty champions in Europe and America are being set up to take the fall for a coming global destabilization. I have not taken this position just to be contrary. If I think about it honestly, my position is truly a losing position. If I am mistaken and Clinton wins on the 8th then I'll probably never hear the end of it, but that's a risk that has to be taken, because what I see here is a move on the chess board that others are not considering. If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong. That said, if I am right, then I still lose, because Trump supporters and half the liberty movement will be so enraptured that they will probably ignore the greater issue — that Trump is the candidate the elites wanted all along. If I am right, I cannot say either way if Trump is aware that he will be a potential scapegoat for the elites. With Trump on the way to the White House I can guarantee a Fed rate hike in December. Imagine what a staged war between Trump and the Federal Reserve will do to the U.S. dollar? What a way to destroy the currency's world reserve status and make way for the IMF's Special Drawing Rights! I also suspect that widespread rioting is on the schedule as well from various social justice mobs; a perfect excuse for expansive martial law measures, don't you think? The point is, as horrifying as a Clinton presidency might be to conservatives (or to everyone), don't get too comfortable under Trump. The party is just getting started and our vigilance must be even greater with a conservative White House, because, like it or not, everything Trump does is going to reflect on us. We can no more allow unconstitutional activities under Trump than we could under Clinton. If you think the election has been chaotic and confusing so far, just wait until after it is over.
