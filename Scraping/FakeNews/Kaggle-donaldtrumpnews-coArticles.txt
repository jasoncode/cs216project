EMERGENCY!! 
Hillary came out of hiding today to make a rare appearance and it was IMMEDIATELY showed why she has been off the campaign trail and hiding from cameras. It hasn't even been 2 months since she dropped like a rock on 9/11 and had to be hurled into the back of the van by Secret Service, and she clearly isn't any better'¶ 
The video shows Hillary confronted with ONE '12 INCH STEP that she would have to step up onto in order to speak, AND SHE WASN'T ABLE TO DO IT! Her campaign staffer RUSHED to her aid to grasp her hand and arm to push her up onto the riser to keep her from falling again! (Scroll down for video) 
Okay, it wasn't technically a 'medical emergency' but it would've been if her staffer wasn't there to grab her! Watch how he rushed to grab her so he could help her CONQUER this 12 inch step she had to take. 
CAN REALLY ELECT SOMEONE AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO CANNOT CLIMB UP ONE 12 INCH STEP???? 
IS THAT 'SEXIST' TO WANT A PRESIDENT WHO WILL BE ABLE TO WALK AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE WITHOUT A WALKER?? 
WATCH for yourself: Hillary heads over to the overflow area to say hello to the crowd in Lake Worth, Florida. But ya know, no enthusiasm there. üôÑ pic.twitter.com/3cUDK245XK

THIS WOULDN'T BE THAT TROUBLING ON IT'S OWN, BUT CONSIDER WHAT WE ALREADY KONW ABOUT HILLARY'S HEALTH! 
She passed out cold on a sidewalk and was drug and then flung into a van like a slab of meat (then blamed pneumonia) 
She's been coughing non-stop since 2008: 
She reportedly now has an ambulance in her motorcade. 
A 'stroke score' finger-squeeze test was administered the day she collapsed on 9/11. 
Oh yea, like we learned today she can't walk up stairs'¶

The newest batch of emails released from Wikileaks puts Hillary Clinton in deep trouble. Eric Bolling read them through and through and discovered that Hillary actually has deep terror ties'¶ 
From Conservative 101: 
Eric Bolling and his team took the time to sift carefully through the emails. 
Announced Bolling on The Five , 'There are even more ne WikiLeaks revelations. In 2014, Hillary sent an e-mail to her Campaign Chairman John Podesta saying, 'Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS.' And the leaked e-mails also show Clinton's staff debated how much outrage she should show lawmakers over Benghazi at her 2015 Capitol Hill hearing. K.G., they have lots 'î it's like 4,000 e-mails in the last couple of days.' 
Does it get any more disgusting than this? 
Saudia Arabia gave her personal 'charity' the Clinton Foundation $35 million dollars, and now in her emails we have proof she knew Saudi Arabia was funding ISIS. 
There you have it folks. Elic Bolling just exposed everything! 
This is the evidence that the American public needed'¶ this will destroy Hillary for good! 
Share it everywhere, America deserves to know the truth!

Comments Barack Hussein Obama's half-brother Malik Obama has become a thorn in the president's side during this election as he has turned on his family by publicly supporting Donald Trump for president. The Gateway Pundit reported that Malik posted a video of himself wearing a Trump hat on Twitter to prove that his account is real. Watch as Malik tells his followers to 'vote Trump,' something we never thought we'd hear an Obama say! 
'î MicroSpookyLeaks‚Ñ¢ (@WDFx2EU7) October 27, 2016 Trump made headlines a few weeks ago when he invited Malik to the second presidential debate as his guest. Western Journalism reported that Malik has been an outspoken Trump supporter throughout this election. 'I like Donald Trump because he speaks from the heart,' he said. ''Make America Great Again' is a great slogan. I would like to meet him.' As for Trump, he's very excited to meet Malik as well. 'I look very much forward to meeting and being with Malik,' Trump said. 'He gets it far better than his brother.' Malik was once a Democrat, but he's said that foreign policy missteps and social concerns have caused him to move to the Republican side. He has also said he distrusts Hillary Clinton, citing her scandals and dishonesty, which he says have only gotten worse since he originally voiced his support for Trump. 'I don't like [Hillary] Clinton,' Malik said in September, in spite of his half-brother's proud endorsement. 'She is dishonest and a liar. She keeps on lying about emails every time.' Malik has slammed Clinton's performance as Secretary of State, pointing out that she inflamed chaos and violence in the Middle East. What do you think about this? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.

Comments Wikileaks is about to confirm the story that The Common Sense Show told four years ago in that Ambassador Stevens was set up to die because his stories of gun-running, child trafficking and drug-running on behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency in order to promote regime change in Libya using terrorists funded by these illegal activities, were leaking out and it was only a couple of months until the election. Ambassador Stevens had to be silenced. And Petraeus had to be put in a place where he was not forced to testify before Congress because he could not take the fifth before Congress. From Beforeitsnews: At the same time, Clinton was broadcasting Stevens whereabouts and she refused to provide the extra protection Stevens was so desperately requesting. Being that Stevens was working for the CIA, then head of the CIA, David Petraeus, would have known about Chris Stevens activities. To protect Obama's 2012 election, both Stevens and Petraeus had to be gone. People are asking me how I knew all of this four years ago and I say, 'I had a deep cover source from inside one of the military/intelligence services who wanted the real truth to be told. Somebody who knew this nation could not afford to let Clinton ever become President'. Now, I am getting confirmation from Wikileaks and others who have reached the same conclusion I did four years ago. Dear Mr. Hodges, This is to inform you that Wikileaks will soon, or has released Clinton emails which will demonstrate the following: The above is already appearing on the Internet in several places. It is clear that Putin would be a fool to allow Clinton and her gang of thugs to continue with their plan. Every time Clinton sags in the polls, she starts talking about 9/11. The evidence is beginning to line up that Clinton interests had motive to commit 9/11. No wonder Clinton tries to blame the Russians for everything, she is the main culprit on the world being brought to the precipice of World War III. It is a gratifying feeling when the dots start to connect. The Aaron Klein Revelations: Aaron Klein, the Breitbart Bureau Chief for Jerusalem revealed, in a Breitbart publication dated March 1, 2016, revealed that 'the email from April 10th, 2011, the State Department employee, Timmy Davis, forwarded an email to the server by Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin.' Please note that the time of this revelation, Huma Abedin, was not yet a household name. The series of emails will eventually have catastrophic consequences for Ambassador Stevens. 'An email containing the whereabouts and plans of murdered U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens passed through Hillary Clinton's private server, dispatches released Monday in the final group of messages from Clinton's emails reveal.' 
Below are some examples of the allegations posed by Klein and these are not empty charges as Klein offered as proof, the following emails. 
'A March 27, 2011 email released last year was titled, 'Chris Stevens mission.' It divulged: 'The current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage offshore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days. 
An April 8, 2011 email was forwarded to Clinton revealing the 'security situation in Benghazi remains quiet. Chris Stevens & team are in the hotel, moving only for meetings as required.' 
An April 22, 2011 email revealed Stevens was on the road: 'I want to let you know about a temporary rotation in Benghazi. TNC Envoy Chris Stevens has been on the road since March 13, when he began his outreach mission, and has been in Benghazi since April 5.' 
An April 24, 2011 email has the exact time of a Stevens meeting: ''Stevens will be meeting with MFA in one hour and will make a written request for better security at the hotel and for better security-related coordination. He still feels comfortable in the hotel. They are looking into the idea of moving into a villa, but that is some way off.' 
If later emails are released, I have no doubt, that we will see that Clinton was transmitting Stevens location up until the time of the attack upon the Benghazi compound and this explains why some of these emails are not being released. However, at some point, they will see the light of day. 
The release of travel information, in any form, is a felony! Remember, the Stevens travel plans are classified and they came from Clinton's private server. A casual Law and Order fan could make the causal connections between the release of these emails and Stevens death. This is absolute evidence that Clinton not only is guilty of multiple felonies, she is an accomplice to murder!

As if Hillary Clinton was not already facing enough legal trouble, new information has surfaced that the former Secretary of State could actually be legally ineligible to run for President of the United States. 
In fact, Clinton could be ineligible to hold any kind of federal office. 
This week, Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey spoke out to say that Clinton's personal email server 'disqualifies' her from the race. To support his argument, he cited federal law Title 18. Section 2071. 
The law reads as follows: 
(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. 
(b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term 'office' does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.

Comments Actor Steven Seagal has just stood up for America, while the rest of Hollywood remains silent. This week has been rough for our country. First, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton collapsed at the 9/11 memorial. Then, she called millions of hardworking Americans 'deplorable.' As if that weren't enough, NFL players throughout the country have been blatantly disrespecting the American flag. Needless to say, Seagal had enough. 'I think the most important job as Secretary of State is ensuring our people don't get killed,' Seagal tweeted. 'If you can't do [email protected] 'Pneumonia or not, she is going to be disastrous for the American people. #NoToHillary,' he continued. Of course, Seagal quickly became the target of liberal fire for his comments, but he refused to break down. He particularly lost it when one Twitter user tried to argued that Hillary was the most capable for the presidency. 'Capable? Capable of leaving AMERICANS to die. Capable of disregarding law. Capable of disrespecting rape survivors,' he argued. He then went on to address race relations in the United States, and the true role President Barack Obama has played in the social evolution of this country. 'Obama has been abysmal for race relations in USA. #TRUTH We need to start having honest dialog,' he wrote. Seagal concluded by pointing out the irony of the attacks he was receiving from liberals everywhere. 'Best thing in the world'¶Making one statement about freedom and getting attacked by every Demo out there'¶ #HYPOCRITICAL,' he tweeted. 'An America without a democrat in the White House, is a SAFER America.' What do you think of Seagal's comments?

Throughout this election, Hillary Clinton has been claiming to be a 'warrior for women' who will do everything in her power to help victims of sexual assault. That's why it came as bad news to her when the video above this story surfaced'¶ 
Infowars reported that the video shows child rape victim Kathy Shelton explain how Clinton allowed her rapist to go free when she was his defense lawyer, even thought she knew he was guilty. Afterwards, Clinton was caught on a recording laughing about the fact that she'd just knowingly set a child rapist free. 
'He took a lie detector test,' Clinton said on the recording, according to The American Thinker. 'I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs (laughs).' 
SHARE this story so we can spread Shelton's story and let people see who Hillary Clinton REALLY is!

(New York Times Results by County) 
The media won't tell you this but Donald Trump CRUSHED Hillary Clinton in the recent election in three key areas: 
For one, the above results by county show that he picked up a significant amount of the counties in the US. The picture is clear that most counties in America voted for Trump . 
Secondly, the media is also hiding from you that Trump CRUSHED Hillary in the Electoral College (EC). As of today, most if not all media outlets show that Trump won the election with only 279 EC votes. But the truth is Trump also won Michigan with 16 EC votes and Arizona with 11 EC votes for a total of 306 EC votes. Hillary only won 228 EC votes but it looks like she barely won New Hampshire which should put her at 232 EC votes. As a result, Trump won 57% of all EC votes. 
HIllary turned in the Democratic Party's worst Electoral College performance in 28 years. With only New Hampshire left to be called, Clinton has turned in the Democratic Party's worst Electoral College performance in 28 years pic.twitter.com/APU85Ty50q 
'î Dan O'Donnell (@DanODradio) November 9, 2016 
Thirdly, in total states it was a landslide. Trump won 31 states to 19 states won by Hillary or 62% of the states. 
The mainstream will argue that Hillary beat Trump in the popular vote which appears accurate. According to the NYT she won 59,923,027 to Trump's 59,692,974 for a difference of only 230,053 or 0.4%. But in California and New York Hillary beat Trump by a combined 4 million votes. If not for these two huge liberal states, Hillary would have gotten shellacked in the popular voting as well. 
The mainstream media will not tell you but Trump won BIGLY!

Back in the 1990's George Soros helped to nearly destroy the Russian economy. So, last year, this grand billionaire was banned from Russia. But, that's not all. George Soros is now a wanted man in Russia and his organizations are considered as a 'threat to Russian national security'. 
From Political Reviewer: 
Matt Taibbi of the Rolling Stone said of Goldman Sachs six years ago: 
'The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. 
'In fact, the history of the recent financial crisis, which doubles as a history of the rapid decline and fall of the suddenly swindled dry American empire, reads like a Who's Who of Goldman Sachs graduates.' 
Obviously Soros wants to be like Goldman Sachs. Phil Butler puts it well when he says: 'George Soros has a finger in every political pie there is. If there is a crisis on our world, it's a safe bet he's had a hand in it.' 
What is your opinion about this?

BREAKING: Since Donald Trump Won The Presidency Ford Shifts Truck Production From Mexico To Ohio 3 Shares Comments 
Ford's heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. 
That's good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. 
It's also good publicity for Ford ( F ), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. 
Ford's south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. 
The Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford's full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. 
'Our investment'¶reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,' said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. 'Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.' 
The move comes at a delicate time for Ford. 
The United Auto Workers union is in negotiations with the automaker as well as General Motors ( GM ) and Fiat Chrysler ( FCAM ) on new labor deals to replace those that expire next month. And promises by the automakers to keep production and jobs at U.S. plants is a major focus of the union. 
The union is particularly worried about the plan Ford announced in July to shift production of the C-Max and Focus out of a Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The automaker hasn't said where that work will go, but employees fear those cars will be built in Mexico. It's also not clear whether any other cars will be made at the Wayne plant instead, in order to protect about 4,000 jobs. 
'We're actively pursuing other alternatives for the Wayne plant that will be discussed with our UAW friends. We haven't decided what will go there,' said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski. 
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that if he's elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States. 
'How does that help us?' Trump said about the Ford investment in Mexico while campaigning in Michigan this week. 'Mexico is becoming the new China.'
