These solar panels are seriously changing the game for both tap water and clean energy. Credit: Zero Mass Water 
In an exciting new development, a startup company called Zero Mass Water has created solar panels that passively and efficiently pull water from the sky, purify it, and transport it to the tap for drinking and cooking purposes. Though the primary motivation for creating these panels was to help people living without access to clean drinking water, it can also help a variety of people from all walks of life while conserving traditional energy that is bad for the environment . 
The founder and CEO of the startup, Cody Friesen, said he was inspired when he was setting up another one of his technologies in Indonesia and thought about the abundance of rain, but lack of clean water in the region. He decided to focus his efforts on improving the global water supply. Friesen told Fastco Exist: 
'Everybody's heard about the latest nanofilter this…or whatever the latest pump technology is. None of those end up being sort of the leapfrog technology that addresses the fact that drinking water is a fundamental human right, and yet we have one person dying every 10 seconds from waterborne illness on the planet.” Credit: Zero Mass Water 
Though these are the first solar panels of their kind, the idea and technology behind the water conversion and supply is simple. Zero Mass Water created a material that absorbs water from the air at an extremely accelerated rate, then it draws the water back out to evaporate it and draw out pollutants. After this purification process, the distilled water is run through a mineral block to add calcium and magnesium and to improve the taste. 
Since waterborne illnesses are so prevalent, this water can save millions of lives and slowly eliminate diseases, as it becomes more widely-used by countries suffering the most as a result of contaminated drinking water . Having an in-home water supply would also save girls and women worldwide approximately 200 million hours annually , as that's how much time they spend retrieving water. They could use this time to go to school, perform more tasks around the house, or work. 
The solar panels are currently being tested in Ecuador, Jordan, and Mexico to test their viability and effectiveness. Though they're starting out in areas rampant with poverty , the panels can also make a difference in the lives of the citizens whose water supplies are tainted with lead. There are roughly 5,300 such water systems, and this could be a safe alternative to drinking that lethal tap water and buying bottled water. Credit: Zero Mass Water 
A single panel can provide enough clean drinking and cooking water for a family of 4, and additional panels can be used on larger buildings, such as hospitals. 
Zero Mass Water hopes that this concept won't remain novel for too long; despite the success they're likely to have for being the only sellers of this panel, their goal is to make the technology common throughout all solar panels installed in people's homes. 
'When you think about solar today, what do you think about? Electricity,” Friesen said. 'Everybody thinks that way. I think that in a few years when people think about solar, they'll also think about water abundance.”

This woman has literally done it all to secure funding for her 172 children. Credit: Maria Cristina Foundation 
Maria Conceicao is astonishingly dedicated to her 172 children living in Dhaka, Bangladesh and has gone to great lengths to provide them with the funding they need to get an education and reach their full potential. 
It all started in 2005, when Conceicao was working as a flight attendant with Emirates Airlines. She had a 24-hour break in Dhaka, Bangladesh and wound up visiting a hospital where a 16-year-old orphan had just given birth to twins. She was sickened by what she saw and told Arabian Business, 
'After going to the hospital in Bangladesh, I just wanted to throw up. It was filthy, dirty, lacking hygiene. There's no beds like we have here, they stay on the floor and they have to fight and compete for floor space. I thought it was so inhumane…. I couldn't understand how someone who is really sick and goes to a hospital and a doctor to get better, could get better [at that hospital]. Going to that hospital was like meeting suicide, their situation would have been worse.” 
Maria found herself incapable of going back to her normal life after witnessing the atrocities occurring just 4 hours from where was living. She made a vow to help these children and their families, first by asking for donations from family and friends and then by starting a foundation called the Maria Cristina Foundation to make a bigger difference in their lives. Credit: Maria Cristina Foundation 
Though funding was abundant when she first started out, the 2008 recession hit charities very hard, and Maria said the funding disappeared overnight. The school her foundation had set up was closed and the children and their families had to go back to being day laborers and begging for money. 
In an effort to get their lives back on the right track, Maria secured the children's spots at a nearby private school but she agreed to pay their tuitions. With no funding, Maria had to get creative with how she would raise awareness and $250,000 annually to pay the tuition and improve the lives of these children. Credit: Maria Cristina Foundation 
That's where her amazing journey began: she knew she would have to gain attention by doing something shocking, so she set her sights on some of the most dangerous treks in the world to become known internationally. Though she had no athletic inclination prior to these highly athletic feats, she began training diligently to quickly accomplish what many others have spent decades working to achieve. 
Here are just a few things she's accomplished since she started her endeavor in 2010: Last Degree to North Pole Expedition, first Portuguese woman to climb Mount Everest, 7 full marathons in 7 days across 7 Emirates, UAE, 7 ultra marathons in 7 days in December, and 6 time Guinness World Record Holder. Credit: Maria Cristina Foundation 
As time has gone on and people have become impressed with her accelerated progress in training, people have lost interest just as fast as they've gained it. That's why she jumped from treks and climbing to extreme running and, now, to swimming. 
Swimming the English channel is extremely difficult and dangerous; by comparison, fewer people have successfully completed the English Channel swim than have reached the summit of Mount Everest. What makes it so challenging is the extremely cold water, which makes hypothermia very likely, and its constant flow of ship traffic that creates currents and obstacles. One year prior to her August 27th attempt, Maria didn't even know how to swim. Credit: Maria Cristina Foundation 
Her attempt at the swim was going well, but she was stopped 7 hours into the swim by an official boat pilot because strong tidal currents prevented her from picking up pace. She said this several days after her attempt: 
'I am disappointed with the outcome. I know I still had so much more to give, but unfortunately allowed myself to be persuaded to stop by the official boat pilot 7 hours into the swim. I wasn't struggling, I wasn't cold, I was just slow. However, I have been overwhelmed and overjoyed by the support that I have received. I have never receive d such strong support for previous challenges.” 
Maria's struggle to provide for her children, who also call her their mother, continues and she will certainly be making another attempt to reach her target fundraising goal. If you would like to donate to her current campaign, you can do so here. Her foundation has already helped so many families and some of her children are even on their way to top universities, something that would have been unfathomable without her dedication and supporters.

Proper hygiene can go a long way in helping to prevent easily-treatable diseases and viruses. Credit: EcoSoap Bank 
Thanks to a college student's inquisitive thinking and passionate followthrough, thousands of Cambodians have been saved from contracting easily-treatable diseases and viruses. It began when student Samir Lakhani traveled to Cambodia and witnessed first-hand the amount of suffering that results from Cambodians not having access to something most people take for granted: soap. 
GoodNewsNetwork relays that Lakhani visited Cambodia to help build fish ponds with an NGO called Trailblazer Cambodia Organization. While he was there for the summer, he witnessed a mother washing her child with laundry detergent. Because few people have soap – as it is considered an expensive luxury, it is not unusual for Khmers to rub their bodies in ash or use harsh cleaning supplies like the mother and her child did. 
Distraught by this reality, the inspiring activist began to ponder solutions to the conundrum. Before long, the Pittsburgh University student realized that Siem Reap – a popular tourist hotspot which hosts over 2 million visitors a year – is home to over 500 hotels and guesthouses. Surely, he thought, their waste could be recycled into others' benefit. After working on the problem long enough, he finally developed a formula for sanitizing and recycling hotel soap bars that would otherwise be tossed in the trash. 
After returning to the U.S. and obtaining his degree in environmental studies, Samir began crowdfunding for his idea to create an Eco-Soap Bank organization. Two years later, he had gained corporate sponsorship and the vision he intentioned was realized! 
Since the project took off, over 650,000 Cambodians have been provided with clean bars of soap. 30 workers are now employed by the company Lakhani founded. In addition to selling the company's eco-friendly products as a source of income, they serve as 'hygiene ambassadors” to bring soap to local schools and educate the populace on the importance of proper hand-washing techniques. 
Thanks to this student's ingenuity, thousands of Cambodian lives have likely been saved.What are your thoughts? Please comment below and share this news!

Hancock speaks a truth that most politicians don't want to hear. Credit: Audio Burst 
Graham Hancock, a British writer and journalist, has offered some amazing insight into the current election in the U.S. As some are baffled by the number of people Trump has garnered support from, others are more surprised at those willing to vote for someone as allegedly crooked as Hillary. 
Most citizens are completely over this election and can't believe that their choices are a racist and misogynistic man who has no knowledge of political policies and a woman who is in bed with foreign regimes and domestic bankers and arms dealers, to name a few. But that is what it has come down to. 
Those in favor of Trump are increasing, and it's not because they're suddenly realizing that they hate people from Mexico or men with awful spray tans. As Hancock stated, 
'What's driving [Trump supporters] in America is a deep distrust of authority and a deep distrust of anything that's connected to the status quo. I'm not sure if politicians really got the message yet, there's absolute revulsion at them.” 
What Hancock is essentially saying is that a vote for Trump is a vote against the politicians that have been manipulating the system for decades now. It's an interesting view, and not something that many have considered as they hear the awful words that come of some Trump supporter's mouths. This movement against the establishment was primarily led by Bernie Sanders, but since he is out of the race, the torch has been somewhat handed to Trump. Hancock went on to say: 
'It's a vote against the system that has failed Americans again and again and again…. It's a global system of control. I think people are aware of that, I think they're fed up, and I think they want change. Trump is getting support because he's certainly not part of that. He looks different, he sounds different, he feels different. Bernie Sanders got a lot of support for the same reason. They were saying different things, but both of them were anti-establishment figures. That's what's going on here, the establishment itself is losing its grip. We are seeing a kind of crazy chaos resulting from that. We will sort it out; human beings are capable of sorting things out. We don't need leaders to sort things out, we can sort things out themselves.” 
Despite this chaos, Hancock views this disillusionment and serious shift as a positive thing and a sign of progress. Now that people are more aware of what is occurring within politics, hopefully the conditions can only improve with each election.

The county is calling it an accident, but many are not convinced that it was. Credit: UK Progressive 
In what some are calling a 'hilliarious” typo, Hillary Clinton's name was misspelled to represent what many people think of her as: a liar. Though it has been waved off as an accident, the ballot spelled her name 'Hilliary” Clinton and some are upset by the handling of this situation in Lonoke County, Arkansas. 
Jerry Shepard, the Republican chairman of the Lonoke County Election Commission, has said that they were not made aware of the typo until voting began. As a Republican, there would be an incentive to put in this last comical comment about Clinton's lack of trustworthiness, but even the Democratic chairman for the county's commission has said that there was no intention to defame her name. Credit: NBC News 
Many are not convinced, as the ballots are checked thoroughly and repeatedly for typos, misprints, and incorrect information before being sent out by mail and to polling places. The misspelling of a major presidential candidate's name would not easily make it through unnoticed. 
Though Arkansas is largely Republican, there are still Democratic voters in the state who were upset with this alleged typo. One disgruntled voter in Lonoke County took to Facebook to express their experience with trying to report the mistake: 
'I would like to believe that they did not do this on purpose because I think it was just a spelling error. However, I did contact the clerk's office and told them of this error and they told me that they are blowing it off because they don't expect people in Lonoke county to vote for Hillary Clinton. 
'Whoever I spoke to they were rude and they just laughed off my complaint so I decided to call the Arkansas Secretary of State's office. They took my complaint and forwarded me to the Arkansas Election Commission, where I filed an official complaint on the Lonoke County Clerk's office.” 
Spelling Hillary's name wrong does not affect citizens' ability to vote for her, but it's the lack of care that has people questioning whether this was really a mistake. If something similar had been done to Donald Trump's name, his supporters would be outraged and attribute it to Clinton's rigging of the election. 
The fact that people aren't more upset at this typo might be evidence of her reputation as a liar in a number of situations. If her email scandal hadn't discouraged some people from voting for her, then her history of constantly lying and changing her mind on key issues might. Though the typo was completely uncalled for and unnecessary, some might argue that it wasn't exactly incorrect.

Posted on November 7, 2016 He goes to school full-time and works three part-time jobs, but running this pantry is important to him. Credit: Justin Franks 
What started as a simple act of kindness has since exploded into a movement that some students rely on at a college in Alabama. Justin Franks, a 20-year-old student at Alabama A&M University, first noticed that some students in his dorm building were going to bed hungry. 
'They didn't have any food,” Franks told ABC News. 'The cafeteria here closes pretty early, and a lot of students here don't have the money to go outside of campus to eat. I wanted to cater to those students.” 
Franks spent $40 of his own money to build up a stock of instant noodles, Capri Suns, and a few household items, such as tissues and bottled waters. He planned to share his stash with those few in need, and decided to share the news of his small stash on Facebook. His post reached over 600 shares, and word spread like wildfire. 
'I didn't think it would get shared that much, but people really cared about our students and Alabama A&M University,” Franks told WHNT News 19. Credit: Fox 5 
Soon after, donations for the food and basics pantry started rolling in to help fund Franks' small operation. He has since moved the pantry to an old mail room in his dorm's building. It's open from 6pm to 11pm, just after the cafeteria closes and into the evening in case late-night studiers need a pick-me-up. 
The pantry also includes bigger basic items, such as toilet paper, deodorant, and toothpaste, along with the dozens of non-perishable food items. It's run just like a regular pantry, where students can come in twice a week and take up to three items. Franks is even training someone else to take over so that the pantry can continue long after he graduates. Credit: Justin Franks 
The full-time student who works three part-time jobs takes this job seriously as well, and has already helped over 100 students. He told ABC News, 
''Service Is Sovereignty' is our school's motto and I want to live up to that. I'm hoping that we can keep expanding the pantry and that it'll continue for years to come.” 
It might be a small gesture but it's helping these students in this small way that can help them get through one of the most challenging years of their life.
