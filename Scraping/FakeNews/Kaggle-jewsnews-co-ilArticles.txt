November 2015 Ads Watch: Israel Loving Hollywood Actor Just Issued Major Plea To America In 3 Minutes That'll Rock The Election Oct 27, 2016 Previous post 
In an impassioned reminder that the freedoms and safety enjoyed by millions of Americans are at risk, actor John Voight has issued a clarion call for voters to save their nation by preventing Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton from being elected. 
'We were once a country of freedom, and now we are becoming a country of tyranny. We are witness to our own people burning down and looting our own cities: Ferguson, Milwaukee, Orlando, Baltimore,' said Voight in a new video. 'We are all witness to our own people killing our police.' 
Voight has said in the past that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump stirs fear in his opponents because he 'represents a form of freedom none of them ever saw before, and they are bewildered about it, and frightened about it.'

Guess Who Ordered Hillary To Leave Our Men To Die In Benghazi Oct 27, 2016 Previous post 
This email that was recently released by WikiLeaks shows that Hillary Clinton received an order from the Saudis to leave our men to die in Benghazi. Hillary also lost 1.5 billion dollars that was sent to the country and got 4 Americans killed. This is the first U.S. ambassador to die in more than thirty years. There are thousands more people that died in Libya as it fell into chaos.

Clinton Campaign In FULL PANIC After Bill's Alleged Son Makes DEMAND That Would HUMILIATE Them Oct 27, 2016 Previous post 
The man claiming to be the son of former President Bill Clinton told Breitbart News Wednesday he wants his father to step up and be man enough to acknowledge him. 'I have always wanted him to step up–for 30 years–you know? I have really been trying to figure this out–my whole life, you know? It is time for him to step up to the plate,' said Danney Williams, 30, who traveled from his Arkansas home to Las Vegas for Wednesday's third presidential debate between GOP nominee Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. 
The Arkansas man is not trolling the Democratic nominee's husband. He said he is formally requesting that the former president submit to a paternity test and put the matter to rest–once and for all. 
'It is up to him now, ' he said. 
'I've proven who I am, let him step up and prove me right or prove me wrong,' he said. 
Williams' mother, Bobbie Ann Williams, is quoted in media accounts describing how, as a prostitute in Little Rock, the then-governor met her while out on a jog. The two became close and shared several intimate encounters, according to those accounts. 
After Williams was born, his mother allegedly told the governor about his son and although Clinton was reluctant, she said in interviews, Arkansas state troopers would pay her child support every month with seven $100 bills. 
The payments stopped however after he announced Clinton was running for president, according to her media accounts.

Paul Joseph Watson Political science professor Helmut Norpoth, who has accurately called the results of the last five presidential elections, still asserts that Donald Trump has an 87% chance of defeating Hillary Clinton despite Clinton being ahead in the polls. Norpoth's model has correctly predicted the outcome of the popular vote for every election since 1996, including the 2000 race where Al Gore won the popular vote but George W. Bush took the presidency. 'It usually turns out that the candidate who does better in his party's primary beats the other guy who does less well,' said Norpoth, adding that Trump's margin of victory in New Hampshire and South Carolina compared to Clinton (who lost in New Hampshire) was crucial to his model. The other factor is the 'swing of the pendulum,' which makes it far more likely for a change of government if one party has been in power for two terms. Norpoth said he

Islamic Militant Compound Discovered Inside America's Borders, Obama Refuses To Act (Obviously) Oct 26, 2016 Previous post 
The threat of terrorism on United States soil continues to skyrocket at the hands of Obama's weak policies. Not only have terrorist groups like ISIS gotten stronger internationally, but they are also finding ways to resettle inside the United States and carry out attacks here. 
Within the past month, we have experienced three terrorist attacks on our own soil. A Muslim jihadi in Minnesota went on a stabbing spree the same weekend that a group of Muslims set off pressure cooker bombs in New York and New Jersey while pledging allegiance to ISIS. 
It has been reported that an Islamic compound has been spotted on American soil. The facility is known as 'Islamberg,' and it has many in the area very scared and worried. 
Islamberg is located in the small town of Tompkins, Delaware County. As the video below will show, many have speculated that dozens of these Islamic compounds exist on American soil, and when these two reporters stumbled upon one, they confirmed our deepest fears. 
They wanted to investigate reports of 'unusual sounds of gunfire and explosions…emanating from the compound.'

Ads ISIS Chainsaw Massacre: Nine Christian Youths Literally Sawed In Half, Accused Of Being Part Of Resistance Faction Oct 27, 2016 Previous post 
Just when you thought ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) could not possibly develop more heinous ways of executing captives and prisoners, news out of the besieged city of Mosul, Iraq, reveals that a group of youths have been put to death in what amounts to nothing short of a chainsaw massacre. According to a source, nine Mosul youths were killed, all accused of belonging to an anti-ISIS resistance faction. 
Iraqi News reported August 31 that nine youths were convicted in an Islamic State sharia court of being members of a resistance faction in the city. They were summarily sentenced to a public execution. The nine were then tied to a pole Wednesday and cut in two with a chainsaw by ISIS militants. 
A source, who wished to remain anonymous, told Iraqi News , 'The death sentence pronounced by ISIS sharia court stated that the men should be tied to an iron pole in the center of Tal Afar Square in Mosul and then sliced into two with an electric chainsaw.' 
The news outlet went on to note that ISIS has executed thousands of the city's citizens since taking over Mosul in June 2014. Although allegations and charges have varied, most of those killed by the extremists were convicted of collaborating with enemy forces. 
The ISIS chainsaw killings come just a week after Islamic State extremists, after convicting six individuals of collaborating with the enemy in sharia court, killed the group by lowering the then still living men into boiling vats of tar . According to Inquisitr , the killings were also a public execution in Mosul, the carrying out of the sentence said to have been done to instill fear in the citizenry. 
It is doubtful that, given ISIS' barbaric and often horrendous killing methods (not to mention the regularity with which killings are carried out), there was a need to instill fear in the local population. At best, the most that could have been accomplished was to reinforce the Islamic State's willingness to kill any and all who oppose its authority.

Paul Joseph Watson Senior British army officer and former deputy supreme allied commander Europe Gen. Sir Richard Shirreff warns that NATO faces 'nuclear war with Russia in Europe,' and that America is already technically at war with Russia. In a hawkish article for CNN , Shirreff asserts that the west faces the biggest threat from Russia since the Cold War and that Vladmir Putin plans to 're-establish Russia's status as one of the world's great powers' by marching into the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Comparing the west's policy towards Putin to the appeasement of Hitler, Shirreff claims that Moscow, 'may have already lit the fuse that could lead to the unthinkable: nuclear war with Russia in Europe.' Under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, an attack on one NATO member country represents an attack on all member countries, meaning the United States would be at war with Russia if Russian troops set foot in Baltic countries. 'A Russian attack on the Baltic states puts America at war with Russia — meaning nuclear war, because Russia integrates nuclear weapons into every aspect of its military doctrine,' writes Shirreff. He also states that 'Russia is at war with America already,' recycling the claim, which remains unproven, that Russia is behind the email hacks that led to Wikileaks' publicizing of Clinton campaign emails. 'And don't think Russia would limit itself to the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. Any form

The migrant, known only as Ghazia A, fled Syria last year along with his family. 
He has since resettled in Germany with his four wives and 22 of his children. One of his daughters has since moved to Saudi Arabia where she has married. 
The family could be receiving more than £320,000 a year in benefits according to a financial manager on the Employers' Association website. 
There is no official confirmation on this figure. 
Under Islamic tradition, the 49-year-old can have up to four wives – as long as he can support them financially. 
Germany does not legally recognise polygamy, meaning that Ghazia A was forced to choose a 'main wife' so the rest of the family could claim benefits. The other three wives are categorised as 'friends' of the Syrian migrant. 
But a local official in the town of Montabaur described the situation as an 'exemption'. 
Ghazia A now lives with his 'main' wife Twasif and their five children in Montabaur, in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate – while the other three wives and children have been moved into neighbouring communities up to 31 miles away.

Jerusalem in Photos from 1862: No mosques, no Palestinians – only ghost towns of massacred Christian areas Oct 27, 2016 Previous post 
A new photographic exhibition in London follows the journey taken by England's Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) in 1862, as he undertook a four month tour around the Middle East. 
And as usual, no sign of mosques or active Palestinian presence as the decades old argument from the Palestinian side to keep up the saga to fight and occupy, for the sake of jihad and foreign aid. 
In the exhibition we find more photographs from Jerusalem in 1862, when the so called 'palestinians' allegedly were already 1 million in population on land they profess to have 'lost to Jewish occupation' a few decades later. The only problem with this argument is that, as with all photographs up to the second decade of 1900's, there are rarely any Muslims or mosques to be found on any photographs. The only mosque – and a confiscated synagogue converted after Muslim invasion is the Temple Mount's Dome of the Rock – and it stands empty of Muslims in ALL pictures through the 1800's and early 1900's, demonstrating the falsity in the Palestinian argument. There are more evidence and remains of the massacres Muslims caused on Christians, than any living signs of Muslims themselves. In comparison, other towns with a living Muslim population documented in photographs during the mid and late 1800's always feature a lot of mosques.

This exhibition follows the journey taken by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) in 1862, as he undertook a four month tour around the Middle East. 
Seen through the photographs of Francis Bedford (1815-94), the first photographer to travel on a royal tour, it explores the cultural and political significance Victorian Britain attached to the region, which was then as complex and contested as it remains today. 
The tour took the Prince to Egypt, Palestine and the Holy Land, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and Greece where he met rulers, politicians and other notable figures, and travelled in a manner not associated with royalty – by horse and camping out in tents. 
On the royal party's return to England, Francis Bedford's work was displayed in what was described as 'the most important photographic exhibition that has hitherto been placed before the public'.

Even the FBI's vaunted reputation for integrity has fallen victim to reach of this evil witch with a capital B. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Hillary Clinton bagman Terry McAuliffe contributed in excess of $675,500 to the Senate candidacy of the wife of FBI agent Deputy Director Andrew McCabe who oversaw the investigation into her use of an illegal homebrew server that exposed our national secrets to Russian hackers. McAuliffe has been a Democrat operative whose willingness to do the Clinton's dirty work over a long number of years saw him rewarded with the governorship of Virginia. As governor, McAuliffe recruited the wife of the FBI's lead investigator to be his party's senate nominee at the behest of Hillary Clinton who was already being investigated by the FBI. 
Acting on the direction of Hillary Clinton, McAuliffe's PAC contributed $467,500 directly to the Senate Campaign of D. Jill McCabe according to campaign finance records. But, that wasn't even the extent of the financial support he extended to Jill McCabe.

For years Sweden has regarded itself as a 'humanitarian superpower' – making its mark by offering refugee to those fleeing war and persecution. 
But people's patience with their visitors is wearing thin following a year of violence, sickening sex assaults and the death of social worker Alexandra Mezher , 22, who was knifed to death at an asylum centre for unaccompanied children at the hands of a Somalian migrant who claimed he was 15. 
At the time, her grieving mother, an immigrant herself from the Middle East said: 'Immigration has destroyed Sweden.' 
Sweden, a country of 9.8million, took 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015. 
The influx included 35,400 unaccompanied minors – nine times more than 2015. 
But nothing could prepare Stockholm for the rise in crime and an abuse of the criminal system. 
And so much so, a nation, which once prided itself on giving a warm welcome to outsiders, has reported a rise in arson attacks against migrant shelters, while support for the right-wing Swedish Democrats has surged.

Voters don't typically think much about the voting machines they're using, but this election season, what kind of voting machine used might end up being critical in how the election turns out. 
That's because Smartmatic, a U.K.-based technology company that provides voting machines to countries around the world, has deep connections to leftist billionaire George Soros . 
Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, the chairman of Smartmatic, is on the board of Soros' Open Society Foundations . He was the former vice chairman of Soros' Investment Funds and the deputy secretary general of the United Nations when he worked as Kofi Annan's chief of staff. 
Malloch-Brown has also worked with consulting firms that have ties to Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and husband, Bill. He was an international partner with the Sawyer-Miller consulting firm, and he was also a senior adviser to FTI Consulting, which handled communications under contract for Bill Clinton's 1992 run for the presidency. 
Top Clinton adviser Mandy Grunwald is a Sawyer-Miller alum. Grunwald was in charge of the firm's communication contract for former President Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential run. She also headed up communications for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid. 
Jackson Dunn, senior managing director with FTI Consulting, worked as an aide to both Bill Clinton and Hilllary Clinton. 
Those are troubling connections.

Turkey Targets Christians – World leaders, the media, and human rights groups remain SILENT Oct 27, 2016 Previous post In the last four years, more than 100 Christian pastors and other religious officials have been deported from Turkey, and banned from reentering. 'When Jesus reached 30 years of age, Allah gave him the duty of being a prophet. He then began inviting people to believe in Allah.' — Turkish textbook on Christianity. '[R]eligious minority students are faced with the option of taking the class or sitting alone somewhere else on the school premises during the classes, thus separating them from their peers and singling out their religious differences.' — U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, Turkey Textbook Report. It is high time that the activists of the global 'human rights community' condemned or at least publicly discussed this 'culture of hate' in the Muslim communities — and particularly the Christianophobia. 
American pastors in Turkey are being arrested hand over fist. 
American Pastor Andrew Brunson, of the Resurrection Protestant Church, was arrested in Izmir (Smyrna)on October 7 alongside his wife, Norine Lyn Brunson, for 'threatening the national security of Turkey.' Brunson is expected to be deported in 15 days. The couple is still being held in detention. 
Turkish authorities also seized the residence permit of Ryan D. Keating, an American student pursuing a PhD in the philosophy of religion at Ankara University. Keating is a Christian who heads the Ankara Refugee Ministry for the Kurtulus Church. While he was leaving Turkey for work purposes, he was told at the airport that his residence permit in Turkey had been cancelled in September for 'national security', meaning that he will not be able to reenter the country. His wife and children are still in Ankara. 
Yet another American Protestant pastor, Patrick Jansen, was not allowed to reenter Gaziantep, where he served. And still another American Protestant was ordered to leave Turkey upon landing at the airport. 
They are not the first. In the last four years, more than 100 Christian pastors and other religious officials have been deported from Turkey — the visas of some of them were not renewed or were completely cancelled. They have been banned from reentering. 
Pastor Brunson had also been exposed to an armed attack in front of the church in 2011, by a Turkish Muslim from the city of Manisa who shouted: 'Al-Qaeda will bring you to account', called members of the congregation 'traitors' and threatened them with 'bombing the church in Manisa.' 
In the meantime, the Protestant Life Bridge Church, in the southern city of Antakya (Antioch), has been closed and sealed upon a complaint of the National Education Directorate and the order of the governor's office for 'giving education illegally.' The church, officials of which are also American citizens, was giving Bible lessons to its members. 
The congregation has started looking for a new place to hold their Sunday services, the Turkish Christian news channel SAT-7 TURK reported on October 8. 
The Protestant community in Turkey has been exposed to discrimination and persecution for a long time.

Bomb shelters are upgraded, gas masks tested amid strained relations between Putin and U.S. By THOMAS GROVE 
MOSCOW—Russian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. 
At the Kremlin's Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. 
The country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. 
Videos of emergency workers deployed in hazmat suits or checking the ventilation in bomb shelters were prominently aired on television when the four days of drills were held across the country. Students tried on gas masks and placed dummies on stretchers in school auditoriums. 
The capital's civil-defense plans are also being upgraded, said Andrey Mishchenko, deputy head of the ministry. 
'An inventory was taken in Moscow of the city's underground spaces, in order to allow us to plan for sheltering 100% of the city's population,' he said, as reported by state news agency RIA Novosti. 
In parallel, commentators on state-dominated airwaves issued some of the shrillest anti-American rhetoric in years. 'Russia is sick of America's arrogant lies,' influential commentator Dmitry Kiselyov said this month after a Syrian peace plan collapsed. 
After a mistaken strike by U.S.-led coalition warplanes on Syrian troops in September, Russia's Defense Ministry warned that its air defense systems could shoot down any American plane that threatened its own forces. 
And when a Russian tabloid wrote that government officials had been asked to take their children back from the prestigious preparatory schools and universities they attend in Britain, France and the U.S., speculation swirled about preparation for all-out war with the U.S. 
The rhetoric reinforces Russians' idea that their country is a superpower on par with the U.S. It also offers a distraction from an economic recession and from President Vladimir Putin's approval ratings, which have dipped from recent highs. The threat of nuclear war also keeps the population

'Iran to Add U.S.-Made Aircraft to Its War Fleet: Obama admin paves way for Tehran to rebuild its air force,' by Adam Kredo, Washington Free Beacon , October 24, 2016: 
The Obama administration is forging a pathway for Iran to purchase American-made airliners that are likely to be converted for use in the Islamic Republic's military, drawing concerns on Capitol Hill amid a flurry of recent attacks by Iranian-backed forces on U.S. military assets in the Middle East, according to conversations with lawmakers and fleet information obtained by the Washington Free Beacon . 
Iran recently announced that it had struck deals with the U.S. Boeing airline manufacturer and France's AirBus that would permit the companies to transfer technology and provide training to help the Islamic Republic produce equipment that would strengthen its aging fleet of American-made planes. 
Iran currently uses at least six Boeing aircraft as part of its air force fleet. These planes were put on display last week when Iran launched a series of war drills aimed at deterring Western attacks. 
As Iran angles to purchase 80 new jets from Boeing, which has lobbied heavily in favor of these sales, the Obama administration is being accused of helping to pave the way for Iran to transfer these commercial liners for use in its war fleet, according to lawmakers and sources familiar with Iran's military buildup. 
Iran has a history of transferring commercial jets purchased from America to its air force for use in military operations and the transfer of weapons and other illicit material abroad. 
Lawmakers worry that the White House's efforts to facilitate new airliner sales to Iran Air, the country's national airline, will help Tehran bolster its war fleet at a time when it is threatening military action

BREAKING: TRUMP MOVES TO FILE CHARGES AGAINST CLINTON! Oct 27, 2016 Previous post 
When Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign over a year ago, the media barely batted an eye. They all believed he was only trying to boost his business. 
As time went on, he began to win debate after debate and state after state as he received the most votes in Republican primary history while battling sixteen other candidates. The liberal media and Clinton campaign quickly went from thinking he was a joke to fearing him. 
As Trump began to take this country by storm, the media and Clintons tried everything in their power to destroy him. They tried desperately to accuse Donald Trump of inciting violence at his rallies. 
Thanks to videos released by Project Veritas , we now have concrete proof that it was Hillary Clinton that paid operatives to storm Trump rallies and incite violence. 
Hillary Clinton did not just pay mercenaries to assault Trump supporters, she also violated the law on several occasions. 
Robert Creamer, a Clinton crony, was one of the organizers of the paid violence and has also visited Obama at the White House at least 230 times. He was forced to resign from his position immediately following the release of these videos. 
Not only is he a top Hillary ally, but he kept her informed. She knew about these attacks and she ordered them to take place so that Donald Trump looked like he was inciting violence and fueling hate. 
Trump was forced to cancel his rally in Chicago due to the extreme violence by operatives working for Hillary Clinton. 
We are being told that Donald Trump is going to press charges on these people, including Hillary Clinton, under the Felony Mob Act. 
In Illinois, Trump will be citing the Illinois criminal statute. The Mob action is a Class Four felony punishable by 3-6 years in prison and a $25,000 fine for each charge in Illinois. When Trump brings forward the paperwork, he very well could charge anyone associated with helping, planning, organizing, or paying anyone to commit acts of violence–which would include Hillary Clinton. 
In Illinois, statute reads as follows: 
A person commits mob action when he or she engages in any of the following: The knowing or reckless use of force or violence disturbing the public peace by 2 or more persons acting together and without authority of law; The knowing assembly of 2 or more persons with the intent to commit or facilitate the commission of a felony or misdemeanor; or The knowing assembly of 2 or more persons, without authority of law, for the purpose of doing violence to the person or property of anyone supposed to have been guilty of a violation of the law, or for the purpose of exercising correctional powers or regulative

RUSSIA HAVE OFFICIALLY DECLARED THAT BILLIONAIRE GEORGE IS A WANTED MAN IN THEIR COUNTRY, CITING HIM AND HIS ORGANIZATIONS AS A 'THREAT TO RUSSIAN NATIONAL SECURITY'. 
Putin banned Soros from Russia last year due to the fact that George helped to nearly destroy the Russian economy in the early 1990's. 
Now this could be the main reason for Obama pushing for war with Russia suddenly, because George is basically Obama's puppet master. 
If war with Russia does happen, would one of reasons for going to war with Russia be Obama trying to protect his commander George ? George has literally wrecked the Russian economy by pushing sanctions on Russia because of involvement in Syria, 
but the main reason is Russia's creation of their own banking system of the BRICS…Which likely means people like George Soros does not profit from. 
Russia declaring George Soros their number one enemy is good news, because if they got to George Soros, things like the refugee crisis and Black

In a truly shocking twist the Suptreme Court decided the grown Iraqi man may not have realised the 10-year-old did not want to be sexually abused by him. 
Amir A, 20, was visiting the Theresienbad pool in the Austrian capital of Vienna last December as part of a trip to encourage integration. 
When the youngster went to the showers, Amir A. allegedly followed him, pushed him into a toilet cubicle, and violently sexually assaulted him. 
Following the attack, the accused rapist returned to the pool and was practising on the diving board when police arrived, after the 10-year-old raised the alarm with the lifeguard. 
The child suffered severe anal injuries which had to be treated at a local children's hospital, and is still plagued by serious post-traumatic stress disorder. 
In a police interview, Amir A. confessed to the crime; telling officers the incident had been 'a sexual emergency', as his wife had remained in Iraq and he 'had not had sex in four months'. 
A court found Amir guilty of serious sexual assault and rape of a minor, and sentenced him to six years in jail.

BREAKING: Muslim shot dead after trying to KILL GUARD at US EMBASSY in Kenya Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
Earlier today, TGR (The Geller Report) published news accounts of Muslims in Kenya going on a murder spree as'part of a campaign to kill unbelievers.' This looks like it may very well be part of that Muslim war. 
Kenya, once the beacon of leight of democracy on the dark continent, now under siege by jihad, thanks in large part to their native son, Obama. 
'Man shot dead after stabbing guard at US Embassy in Kenya,' By Tom Odula | AP October 27 at 1:01 PM 
NAIROBI, Kenya — A man was shot dead after stabbing a policeman guarding the perimeter wall of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi and trying to take his gun, a Kenyan police official said Thursday. 
The policeman who had been stabbed opened fire in self-defense and killed the attacker, said Vitalis Otieno, the officer in charge of the Gigiri area that hosts several embassies and the U.N's African headquarters. 
'He fired first and shot the person and the person died on the spot,' Otieno said. 
The identity of the attacker, a Kenyan from the volatile region of Wajir near Somalia, is known to police, Otieno said. 
Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel were seen collecting evidence at the scene of the shooting.

They are a group that calls themselves 'Public Purity'. Somehow, they have found the audacity to demand the Brits stop taking their dogs out in public because, wait for it… 
Dogs are considered impure under Sharia Law . 
Of course, these Muslims feel entitled to make this demand because it appears that they believe the British citizens are required to do certain things in order to keep Muslims from feeling uncomfortable. Somehow, it's become the responsibility of the Brits to ensure that Muslim residents feel more at home. 
This intrusive behavior being served up by Muslim immigrants does in part explain British citizens refusal to remain in the European Union. 
Does that make any sort of sense to you?

BREAKING – Investigative Journalist Found Dead, Was Working For…   
Talk about Hillary and a bad way and there is a very good chance you could wind up dead. Is that what happened here? 
Gavin MacFadyen, the WikiLeaks Director and Founder of the Center for Investigative Journalism, has died. WikiLeaks has officially confirmed it on their Twitter by posting a tribute to the man, saying that he is now taking 'his fists and his fight to battle God.' ( inquisitr.com ) 
This Twitter message was signed JA, referring to the WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange. Somehow even with massive restrictions, Assange was able to post his message. 
Wikileaks also shared a statement from MacFadyen's wife, Susan Benn. The statement was published on MacFadyen's Center for Investigative Journalism site where she noted that he was a 'fierce defender of justice and human rights around the world.' 
Susan states her husband was a strong force behind the ever-changing world of journalism, and had always been committed to ethical, yet hard-hitting, journalism. She even quoted him, saying, 'Good journalism is always political journalism.' 
This man was Assange's mentor and closest friend, as well as the mentor for many other people in the industry.

November 2015 Ads THE BIG CHILL: Kill Fat Cells Instantly Just by Freezing Them! You'll Never Believe How it Works   
For most people, fat bulges are something they don't want. It makes our thighs jiggle, our clothes fit tight and look bad, and typically lingers despite our torturous attempts to eliminate it. Too much of it increases our risk for certain illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes, so for decades researchers have looked for ways to reduce it. Humans have two types of fat: white fat & brown fat, and understanding the differences between the two, can help people lose weight. 'White fat' is the thin layer of blubber we see on the human belly. backs of arms and on the thighs. This particular fat acts as a thermal insulator, that keeps body temperatures stable. LEARN MORE: 'Brown fat,' on the other hand, is less abundant in the body and creates heat, rather than trapping it like white fat does. Brown fat actually warms a cold body by burning energy or calories. White fat however, can take on brown fat characteristics, with the resulting product called 'beige fat.' This process is called 'browning.' Because beige and brown fat are able to burn calories, they are a positive force for weight loss, while an excess of white fat is associated with weight gain and obesity. According to Dr. Philip A. Kern, a researcher of the University of Kentucky School of Medicine, browning fat tissue would be an excellent defense against obesity, as it would make the body burn extra calories rather than converting them into fatty tissue. Where Do We Have Brown Fat? Brown fat can be difficult to study because it is hard to find in adults, and typically found in unpredictable locations in the body, and not always in the same place on every person. There's a region in the neck and the shoulders, where you typically find it, but again not on everybody. In a recent study, brown fat was found in the chests and down the spines of a group of healthy young men, along with places in the abdomen…..

Obama's Team List: Muslims Named for Top Jobs – Christians Purposely Removed   
The latest from top Clinton family friend and political aide John Podesta, courtesy of hacked emails released by WikiLeaks, is that President Obama's transition team – the officials tasked with helping the then-senator move into the White House and set up executive shop, in the 2008-09 time period – made and maintained lists of Muslims who would be great for top jobs in the administration. 
But what's more worrisome than this special interest revelation was that the emails seem to show the transition team members went out of their way to also keep off Christians. 
Talk about preferential treatment. 
The Daily Caller reports: 
'According to an email chain from 2008, John Podesta received lists of exclusively Muslims and Asians to be considered for jobs in the Obama administration. The email chain revealed that in this process, Middle Eastern Christians were purposefully excluded, or set aside in a separate list, with an aide writing, 
''In the candidates for top jobs, I excluded those with some Arab American background but who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. In the last list (of outside boards/commissions), most who are listed appear to be Muslim American, except that a handful (where noted) may be Arab American but of uncertain religion (esp. Christian).' 
'Also notable, there was concern that some of the Muslims suggested would not survive media scrutiny, with one aide writing, 'High-profile Muslim Americans tend to be the subject of a fair amount of blogger criticism, and so the individuals on this list would need to be ESPECIALLY carefully vetted.' 
'She continues, 'I suspect some of the people I list would not survive such a vet — but I do personally know, at least in part, virtually all of the candidates in the 1st two categories (but I know very few of those listed for outside boards/commissions).'

Some Evidence is coming out regarding the handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton's private server. A frequent donor of the Clinton's has donated a substantial amount of money to the wife of the FBI agent responsible for Hillary's case. The FBI's investigation found that Hillary was innocent of any crimes. Wonder why. 
Let me just start by saying that this is the single worst crime a person running for President in the US has EVER been convicted of. Hillary Clinton was just proven beyond any doubt to have been directly involved with the bribing and promoting of a top FBI agent during her own email trial. 
Let me break this down for you: 
Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, one of Bill and Hillary Clinton's most consistent backers, donated nearly $500,000 to the Virginia state Senate campaign of a candidate (Dr. Jill McCabe) who is married to the FBI's deputy director. – Daily Mail 
McCabe's husband, Andrew McCabe, was the associate deputy of the FBI's Washington field office, which was tasked with investigating Hillary's emails. 
This is where it gets really interesting. Sometime between the donation being made and the beginning of Clinton's email investigation, McCabe was promoted to the Deputy Director of that office, giving him full control of the Clinton investigation.

Michael Moore calls anyone voting for Donald Trump a 'legal terrorist' Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
While doing press for his surprise Donald Trump movie that he released on Tuesday after making it in secret, 'Michael Moore in TrumpLand,' Michael Moore made it very clear what he thinks about those voting for Donald Trump. 
While talking to Rolling Stone , the Oscar-winning director said that he made his movie in an attempt to convince undecideds that voting for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton isn't a bad idea. And that Trump supporters will be hurting the country. 
'I want them to think about the damage they could do by being a legal terrorist on November 8,' Moore said. 
When Rolling Stone asked him to explain what a 'legal terrorist' means and if it's a catch-all for Trump voters, Moore responded: 
'Any. Legally, you have a right to vote on November 8. You can go in there and even though you're not necessarily in favor of Trump and you don't like him that much and you know he's a little crazy, you also know he's going to blow up the system. The system that took your job and house away from you. You get to get back at the system now and blow it up and this is the only day you can do it legally. He's told everybody that's what he's going to do. He's the outsider who is going to ride into town and blow up the old way. So you, as a voter, get to participate in the detonation.

The Left Turns on Bob Dylan for His Pro-Israel Views, Refusal to Acknowledge Nobel Prize Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
So Bob Dylan has won the Nobel Prize for Literature 'for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.' His name is now enshrined among a list of laureates that includes luminaries like T. S. Eliot, William Faulkner, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. 
It's a tremendous honor for the legendary singer-songwriter, that's for sure. But it's also stirred up its share of controversy. I won't debate Dylan's award—I'll leave that to my esteemed colleagues Andrew Klavan and Ron Radosh —except to say two quick things. First, when the Nobel Peace Prize has gone to people like Yasser Arafat and Barack Obama, did it dim the luster of the prizes in other categories? And second, I like the idea of songs like 'Gotta Serve Somebody' and 'Saved' (and, apologies to Andrew, even 'It Ain't Me, Babe') joining the pantheon of Nobel Prize-winning literature. 
But now that the reliably left-leaning Nobel Prize Committee has given Dylan an award, a funny thing has happened. The left has begun to turn on Dylan for being less than the predictable leftist they have expected him to be. In Defense of Bob Dylan's Nobel Prize for Literature—He Deserves it! 
The first example comes to us from that cherished source of unbiased news, Al Jazeera. In a recent editorial , French sociologist and 'media critic' Ali Saad takes the media to task for reporting the news of Bob Dylan's award without mentioning that he— gasp— supports Israel. Saad gripes that: 
…media outlets, both Arab and international, framed the story without taking issue with Dylan's pro-Israel stance and instead portrayed him exclusively through the prism of his constructed image as defender of the oppressed. 
Saad goes on to cite 'Neighborhood Bully,' an early '80s tune from Dylan that expresses support for the nation of Israel. 
The song, that Stephen Holden described in The New York Times in 1983 as ' an outspoken defence of Israel ', begins by stating two key precepts emphasising the Israeli perspective: first by comparing Israel to a man in exile whose enemies unjustly 'claim he's on their land', a sentence that serves as a scolding to those who refute the legitimacy of Israel's historic claim to Palestine's land. Then, by metaphorically presenting Israel as a man 'outnumbered by a million to one', which postulates the frequent representation of Israel as the underdog of the Middle East.Such a stance by an anti-war activist raises serious doubts over Dylan's commitment to humanity

France: Muslim Screams 'There is Only One Master — Allah', Punches Teacher in Front of Pupils Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
This is the France of today and the France of the future, courtesy the suicidal Muslim immigration policies that French authorities (and European authorities in general) continue to pursue, even to the point of national suicide. 
'Attacker Says 'There is Only One Master — Allah', Punches Teacher in Front of Pupils,' by Virginia Hale, Breitbart , October 21, 2016 (thanks to The Religion of Peace ): 
A primary school teacher was beaten outside his classroom by two young men who called him a racist after seeing the man rebuke a child of non-European origin. 
The teacher was violently attacked near the entrance of his school while walking back from Marais Stadium, in Argenteuil in Val-d'Oise, with his pupils after a PE class. 
After Paul Langevin reprimanded one of the children in his class on Monday who was being disruptive and using bad language, two young men jumped out of their car screaming 'Don't you talk to her like that, racist', at the 50 year old. 
Mr. Langevin protested: 'But I am their master', using the word maître, which also means 'primary school teacher' in French. One of the men replied: 'And I am a thug' as the other knocked him to the ground

The REAL REASON Hillary Was Not Prosecuted For Her Email Scandal Will Infuriate You Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
Oh, Governor Terry McAuliffe… The smelly, Democratic cat of politics that just keeps returning to our doorstep. 
Just this summer he restored voting rights to thousands of felons with the hopes of garnering more votes for Clinton (I'm surprised his legislation wasn't entitled, 'Felons for Felons!'). 
Now we've found out that he and his money are likely part of the reason why Hillary Clinton was not prosecuted for her e-mail scandal. 
In a story line that would make the writers of House of Cards salivate, Governor McAuliffe donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the campaign of the Deputy FBI Director's wife. 
Yes, you read that right. 
According to Zero Hedge : 
The latest allegation of potential impropriety and conflict of interest involving the Democratic Party and the FBI, which over the summer famously cleared Hillary Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing as relates to her personal email server, comes not from a Podesta email or a Wikileaks disclosure, but the WSJ which overnight reported that the political organization of Virginia Govenor Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton's email use .

TRUTH: No Apartheid in Israel, Says Black South African Politician Oct 28, 2016 Previous post Any black South African who claims there is apartheid in Israel is either uninformed or blatantly dishonest, says a member of parliament in Pretoria. 
According to Kenneth Meshoe, chairman of the African Christian Democratic Party faction, any attempt to compare Palestinians' experience in Israel with the former racist regime is offensive to individuals who suffered under the system of racial separation. 
Whatever challenges the Arab minority in Israel faces, the reality of life here cannot be compared to his experiences growing up, he insists. 
'There is freedom of movement in this country that we never had in South Africa,' Meshoe told Tazpit Press Service (TPS) during a visit to Jerusalem last week. 'Benches and bathrooms said 'whites only.' We could never take 'white' transportation. Most white doctors would not treat black patients, only white ones. And those who were willing to treat black patients out of compassion – many of them would ask the patients to enter their clinics through the back door so they wouldn't be seen by the white patients in the lobby. I don't know if it was illegal for white doctors to treat black patients, but the reality was that very few did.' 'Perpetuating Propaganda' 
According to Meshoe, 'Some South Africans who say there's apartheid in Israel are only repeating things they've heard from other people, not because they've actually seen it themselves. They are just perpetuating propaganda. 
'Other people – politicians – are only thinking about their needs, and the statements that will serve their needs. They ask 'what do I gain [by claiming there is or is not apartheid in Israel] and then make a decision. So they are perpetuating something that that they know very well is a lie.' 
Meshoe said he first visited Israel several years after Nelson Mandela was elected president in 1994. He joined a church delegation to the Holy Land and used the opportunity both for a religious pilgrimage and a political education, but the latter came as a surprise. 
'On that trip, I deliberately looked for anything that looked like apartheid. I took a bus to the center of Jerusalem, but blacks, Jews, Arabs and

BREAKING: Wall Street Journal Reveals Shock Business Details About Podesta and Russia Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta has been linked to an investment firm owned by the Russian government. Moreover, it has been shown that he tried to hide this connection from the U.S. government. 
Five years ago, the U.S.-based solar energy startup Joule Unlimited elected Podesta to its board of directors in the hopes that he would help it foster the sorts of international relationships needed for long-term success, according to The Wall Street Journal . 
Lo and behold, Podesta did exactly that. Within months of his election to the board, the Russian firm Rusnano announced plans to invest about $35 million in the solar company. Several months later, Joule invited Rusnano's chairman Anatoly Chubais to join its board of directors. 
Note that around this time, Podesta joined then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's Foreign Affairs Policy Board, seemingly unconcerned about the potential conflicts of interest at play. This attitude changed in 2014, when he signed up to serve as a counselor to President Barack Obama. 
Hacked emails published by WikiLeaks last week showed that in 2014, Podesta asked that his shares in Joule be transferred to a newly created entity called Leonidio Holdings, LLC. 
Speaking with reporters on Wednesday, a Clinton campaign representative confirmed this finding, but claimed that the entity was owned by Podesta's children — and that his purpose in transferring his holdings to them was to recuse 'himself from all matters pertaining to Joule for the duration of his time at the White House.' 
Here's the problem: The emails published by WikiLeaks also revealed that Podesta paid the bill for Leonidio's incorporation in Delaware — and that he also took care of expenses for some legal work performed for Joule in 2005 by a law firm

FEAR OF TRUMP: BUSH, OBAMA, CLINTON ALL BUYING PROPERTY IN NON-EXTRADITION NATIONS – WILL TRUMP PROSECUTE THEM Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. 
Reports are circulating that the Clintons have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank, via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. 
This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself, Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesn't plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. 
The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. 
Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office, he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e mail server. All the way to gun running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi.

President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million dollar seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country.

BY ROBERT SPENCER 
It's a common and recurring tendency among conservative Catholics to be complacent regarding the jihad threat because of a desire to see Muslims as allies in a culture war against all-encroaching and authoritarian secularism. This idea is based on ignorance of or indifference to the fact that, with its polygamy, divorce at a word, sexual slavery of Infidel women, allowance for wife-beating, tolerance for early abortion, and more, Islamic sexual morality is hardly akin to Catholic sexual morality. There is also a tendency, which is also found all over the West outside the Catholic Church, to assume that various concepts, and acts designed to express them, mean the same thing in an Islamic context that they do in a non-Muslim context. That false assumption is what we see here from Archbishop Chaput with regard to modesty. 
Archbishop Chaput says: 'The hijab and the burqa say two important things in a morally confused culture: 'I'm not sexually available;' and 'I belong to a community different and separate from you and your obsessions.'' In reality, that is what a Western woman might be intending to convey, but in an Islamic context the message is slightly different, and that slight difference is all-important. Yes, the hijab and burqa certainly say, 'I'm not sexually available' and 'I belong to a community different and separate from you and your obsessions.' But there is more. The Qur'an says: 'O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused.' (33:59) This is the foundation of the prevailing assumption in Islamic culture that if a woman is raped or sexually abused, it is her fault for exciting men, who can't be expected to control themselves. This is the assumption underlying honor killing, and the reason why it is so common in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and other Muslim countries for women to be imprisoned after they were raped: the rape is their fault. 
So the hijab and burqa are really saying: 'I am assuming the responsibility — willingly or not — for the possibility that I might be raped or sexually abused.' It is a visible sign of the subjugation of women. 
And that 'willingly or not' clause is all-important as well. Archbishop Chaput says: 'I admire the integrity of those Muslim women' who wear the hijab and the burqa. He assumes that they are wearing it freely, as they would be in the West. And to be sure, many Muslim women, especially in the West, are indeed wearing it of their own volition. What does Archbishop Chaput think of the integrity of Aqsa Parvez, whose Muslim father choked her to death with her hijab after she refused to wear it? How does he feel about the integrity of Amina Muse Ali, a Christian woman in Somalia whom Muslims murdered because she wasn't wearing a hijab? And of the 40 women who were murdered in Iraq in 2007 for not wearing the hijab; and of Alya Al-Safar, whose Muslim cousin threatened to kill her and harm her family because she stopped wearing the hijab in Britain; and of Amira Osman Hamid, who faces whipping in Sudan for refusing to wear the hijab; and of the Egyptian girl, also named Amira, who committed suicide after being brutalized for her family for refusing to wear the hijab; and of the

UN spokesman depicted the human toll of the Mosul offensive: mass executions of those delaying ISIS convoys as well as human shields. Yoel Domb 
The UN Human Rights Commission described a number of the atrocities being perpetrated by ISIS operatives during the course of the Mosul offensive in the past week. For example, three women and three young girls were shot to death because one disabled girl could not maintain the pace of a group of villagers who had been evacuated from the place they were in by the terrorists. 
UN officials claim this is just one of a number of cases of civilian executions by ISIS in the past week. Civilians were also used as human shields against the attacks of the Iraqi army and the Kurds. 70 other dead civilians were discovered with gunshot wounds, as well as 50 policemen. 
In the village of Sapina, 45 kilometers south of Mosul, 15 civilians were shot dead and their bodies thrown into a river. Other

With more than 50 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents assigned to investigate Hillary Clinton's criminal use of a private email server, how did she avoid charges? 
Now, the smoking gun has emerged. 
Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a long-time Clinton insider and former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman, steered at least $675,000 to the election of the wife of an FBI official involved in the Clinton probe. McAuliffe's political action committee gave $467,500 to the state senate campaign for FBI agent Andrew McCabe's wife. He is now the deputy director of the FBI. 
More money came to her through the Democratic Party of Virginia : 
Jill McCabe received an additional $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, the report states, which is heavily influenced by McAuliffe. 
The money directed by McAuliffe began flowing two months after the FBI investigation into Clinton began in July 2015. Around that time, the candidate's husband was promoted from running the Washington field office for the FBI to the No. 3 position at the FBI. 
Within a year, McCabe was promoted to deputy director, the second-highest position in the bureau.[…] 
The governor's office claimed the FBI's McCabe met the governor only once — on March 7, 2015, when McAuliffe persuaded Jill McCabe to run. 
The 2015 Virginia state Senate run — her first run for public office — was unsuccessful as she lost to the incumbent Republican. 
McAuliffe 'supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors… Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would

The RS-28 Sarmat missile, dubbed Satan 2 by Nato, has a top speed of 4.3 miles (7km) per second and has been designed to outfox anti-missile shield systems. The new Sarmat missile could deliver warheads of 40 megatons – 2,000 times as powerful as the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Scroll down for video Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly planning to replace the country's older SS-18 Satan weapons with the new missiles amid a string of recent disagreements with the West. The Kremlin has stepped up the rhetoric against the West and carried a series of manoeuvres that has infuriated politicians in the US and UK. The pictures were revealed online by chief designers from the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau. A message posted alongside the picture said: 'In accordance with the Decree of the Russian Government 'On the State Defense Order for 2010 and the planning period 2012-2013', the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau was instructed to start design and development work on the Sarmat.

Are Native Americans Part of the Ten Lost Tribes of the Jewish People? Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
'Therefore was the name of it called Bavel; because Hashem did there confound the language of all the earth; and from thence did Hashem scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.' Genesis 11:9 (The Israel Bible™) 
When Europeans first glimpsed Native Americans more than 400 years ago, many were convinced they had discovered the Lost Tribes of Israel. At closer look, the connections are astounding. This hidden association has taken on greater importance recently as the two nations face similar threats, and perhaps even a common Messianic vision quest. 
Unmistakable traces of Jewish prayer echo in the voice of Joseph Riverwind , the Amahura (war chief) of the Northern Arawak Nation, the indigenous peoples of South America and Caribbean, as he sings, 'Shema, shema, nayena, popaska hoya yah'. He translated this ancient Native American song for Breaking Israel News :

UN Press Corps Expunges Israel, As If The Jewish Homeland Doesn't Even Exist Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
The United Nations has a long history of insulting, disparaging and attacking Israel. It's press corps now seems to want to selectively remove Israel from its records. 
On October 16, 2015, the UN Security Council met to discuss the violence in the Middle East. US Ambassador Samantha Power delivered her remarks about her ' deep concern… about the current situation. ' She specifically condemned the violence in ' Jerusalem, the West Bank, Israel and the Gaza Strip. ' However, when the UN media center summarized her remarks, it stated that the US condemned the violence in ' Jerusalem, West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere .' 'Elsewhere'? Really? Was writing 'Israel' too difficult? Was acknowledging the stabbings and attacks in Israel too controversial? 
When the Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs at the UN, Tayé-Brook Zerihoun, gave an update on the situation, he described the violence in ' the West Bank, Jerusalem and East Jerusalem ,' but the press corps just mentioned a ' deadly week in the West Bank ' removing any mention of Jerusalem. 
Most alarmingly, the Assistant Secretary General welcomed ' Prime Minister Netanyahu's repeated assurances that Israel has no intentions of changing the historic status quo at the holy sites ,' but the UN media completely omitted the statement in its coverage. As the Temple Mount rumor was the rallying cry for Palestinian extremists to engage in violence, shouldn't that have been prominently highlighted, not ignored?

ISLAM NOT WELCOME: Obama just got TERRIBLE NEWS – THIS could END his MUSLIM 'REFUGEE' Program… FOREVER! Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
The brilliant lawyers at Judicial Watch just did something that is sending SHOCK WAVES through the Obama White House. They are filling official requests to learn every detail about President Barack Obama's illegal and unconstitutional plan to import thousands of Muslim Syrian 'refugees' into America. And they are already taking Obama to court to force him to turn over this information. 
This bold legal action will expose Obama's corruption to sunlight, and could quickly be the end of the Syrian refugee program. Incredible! 
Judicial Watch is suing the Department of State for documents related to President Barack Obama's Refugee and Resettlement program as part of an investigation into the Obama administration's plan to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year, the conservative foundation announced Monday. 
The suit was filed in Washington, D.C., after the State Department failed to respond to two Freedom of Information Act requests from Judicial Watch in 2015. In May, Judicial Watch sought records related to the State Department's agreements and interactions with voluntary agencies that help place and assist new refugees. In September, Judicial Watch sought records regarding an August meeting between State Department representatives and a South Carolina non-profit. 
'The Obama administration doesn't want Americans to know about how it places refugees from terrorist states in their local communities,' Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton says in a statement Monday. 'The fact we had to file a federal lawsuit to obtain basic information about Obama's

WATCH: BlackLivesMatter Cop Hater Slaps Police Horse Then GETS MAJOR PAYBACK From Horse…. Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
Scroll down for video 
For most critical thinking individuals, common sense usually dictates staying clear of bigger objects that could pose a threat, especially within the animal kingdom. However for the 'blissfully young and ignorant', that innate and inborn instinct at times needs a little reinforcement, and no doubt getting kicked by a police horse hopefully did the trick. 
The incident took place during the Queen's University homecoming in Kingston, Ontario, when a young blond woman ran up behind a police horse mounted by police officer and smacked the horse on its rear, and of course the horse immediately responded as it was trained to do, and kicked the woman to the ground, face first. 
The 40-second video captures the woman wearing a dark shirt with a red stripe appearing in front of the brief video clip running towards the horse, and the whispered commentary coming from the operator seems to indicate that this was all a part of a silly prank, and the young blond was actually the dupe or more likely the dope, take your pick.

ALERT – New Bill Clinton Mistress Confirmed, Hillary Camp Panics… Oct 28, 2016 Previous post The identity of one of Bill Clinton's long-time mistresses was just revealed. The former president's Secret Service detail nicknamed the mistress 'Energizer' because of the way Bill always 'perked up' and seemed revitalized after her visits. Julie McMahon has been outed by the press as Bill Clinton's 'Energizer,' a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Energizer Bunny. This mother of three and socialite has publicly denied being one of Clinton's lovers, but a plethora of purported evidence is now unfolding online in an effort to refute McMahon's claims of innocence, as per Bizpac Review . McMahon reportedly lives just a few minutes away from Bill and Hillary Clinton's home in New York, which is called Whitehaven. If the Clintons were Republicans, the liberal mainstream media would be calling them racists over the chosen name of their luxurious estate. Always, Julia McMahon would arrive at Whitehaven via SUV. She would only stay a few hours sometimes, but other times she would spend an entire week at the Clinton residence. Julia McMahon reportedly met both Bill and Hillary in 1998 when he was president. Although the Clinton campaign has tried to label McMahon a friend to both of the Clintons, she only visited or spent the night at the house when Hillary wasn't home, the Daily Mail reports. Sometimes, McMahon allegedly arrived just mere minutes after the departure of the former first lady. The Secret Service agents on the Clinton Whitehaven detail were reportedly not ever privy to the woman's name, but they were allegedly under strict orders not to approach or stop her when she arrived. Every member of a president's family is protected by a Secret Service detail. The Secret Service reportedly uses the same letter to assign a codename to protectees. Bill Clinton's Secret Service name is reportedly 'Eagle' and Hillary's is 'Evergreen.' The Secret Service may have run out of 'E' codenames over the years thanks to all of Bill's lady friends.

BRACE YOURSELF: End Times War of Gog and Magog Has Already Begun, Says Mystic Rabbi Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
'And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions.' Joel 3:1 (The Israel Bible™) 
Just a few days prior to the Jewish New Year, Rabbi Nir Ben Artzi , a noted kabbalist with thousands of followers in Israel, has revealed a divine redemptive plan for the world which will see Europe overrun with Muslims, Syria's chaos spilling into the West, the US elections spelling disaster for American Jews, and Israel's importance becoming greater than ever.

BY CHRISTINE WILLIAMS 
The West has in effect developed a two-tier legal system for Muslims. 
The article below is about a baby being dumped in the road, with the Muslim migrant perpetrator escaping jail time. This follows another shocking recent report about the rape of a 10-year-old boy at a swimming pool in Vienna by a Muslim refugee from Iraq; his sentence was overturned because the judge accepted, outrageously, that the man thought the little boy consented. 
Our senses have seemingly gone numb to Muslim crime. This is similar to the phenomenon of how Muslim Arab violence against Israel is tolerated, as suggested by Middle East scholar Ephraim Karsh: 
The sight of Arabs killing Jews (or other Arabs for that matter) is hardly news; while the sight of Jews killing Arabs is a man-bites-dog anomaly that cannot be tolerated. 
Karsh's comment is based on the unflattering principle of low expectations toward Muslims, which is a costly malady, as Western civilized society is slowly descending into the barbarism seen in Islamic states. 
Less than two decades ago, no one could could have imagined reports such as these: Violent 'asylum seekers hurl chairs and throw punches in 'wild west' fight that left five in hospital'; a 90-year-old woman gets raped by a Muslim; a 79-year-old woman visiting her sister's grave also gets raped by a Muslim; up to a million girls in the UK are sexually assaulted by Muslim rape gangs; and crime has seized Europe, with coverups of Muslim crime in the U.S. as well. 
'No jail time for asylum seeker who dumped baby in road', by Paul Gillingwater, The Local , October 19, 2016: 
The 27-year-old had been living in an asylum centre in Vienna's Floridsdorf district and had already been given several warnings for being drunk and violent. 
So when he turned up again intoxicated with a beer in his hand and was told to leave, he flew into a furious rage. 
Spotting his baby daughter in a pram nearby, he grabbed her and ran into the busy road, and put her in the middle of a traffic lane. 
The man's lawyer denied however that he wanted to cause the child any harm, saying he wanted to take a photograph

SHOCK: 15-Year-Old Document Explodes on Hillary… 21 Children Died Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
It has been suggested that Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is perfectly OK with people dying if it furthers a particular agenda or serves to protect her own vested interests. 
By way of example we could easily point to the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack, in which four Americans under the auspices of Clinton's State Department were killed, or her staunch support for abortion , which has abruptly ended the lives of millions of innocent babies before they were even born. 
Now it has been alleged that Clinton may bear responsibility for the deaths of children who had already been born, 21 of them to be exact, who perished tragically in the massive inferno that enveloped the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993, according to David T. Hardy, an attorney and Waco expert writing for The American Thinker . 
Those who remember what happened in Waco will recall that there had been a long and intense standoff between dozens of members of a cult and federal authorities over alleged trafficking and possession of illegal firearms. 
That standoff ultimately degenerated into an all-out assault on the compound with armored vehicles, heavy weapons and copious amounts of tear gas, eventually starting a massive fire that burned the compound to the ground, killing 74 members of the group, including 21 children. 
That tragedy has been largely blamed on then-Attorney General Janet Reno, but there is some evidence to suggest that the order to assault the compound came from the Clinton White House, perhaps even from Hillary herself. 
One piece of evidence that may point to that conclusion is the transcript of the FBI's interview with Lisa Foster following the death of her husband Vince, which was ruled a suicide.

Putin Just Exposed US Election Rigging By Trolling The State Dept. In The Most Hilarious Way Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
Proving he does, indeed, possess both a caustic wit and sharp political acumen, Putin just shut down the raging rigged elections controversy in what could best be called an epic prank to prove the point — Russia requested, and was unsurprisingly denied, permission to monitor the U.S. presidential election. 
Think about it. This somewhat tongue-in-cheek offer, although likely made with the expectation of futility, makes several critical points on the true farcical nature of the American electoral process. 
State Department spokesman Mark Toner, cited by USA Today , dismissively condemned President Vladimir Putin's suggestion as a 'PR stunt,' and Meg Casper, spokeswoman for Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler, noted, 'We've allowed observers from overseas in the past from other countries, never from Russia,' adding both the FBI and Department of Homeland Security 'told us not to do this.' 
But the swift rebuke from the U.S. aligns more with its unprecedented since the Cold War anti-Russia propaganda campaign — a sensationalistic and proven fictitious narrative meant to inculcate Americans into believing Russia poses an imminent threat. 
In fact, with the Clinton campaign thoroughly capitalizing on the laughable narrative to warn Russia might attempt to rig the elections, and Donald Trump, rightly pointing to the former secretary of state's efforts to rig the system from within and being accused of having ties to Putin, the State Department's rebuke seems more a hypocrisy-tinged joke. 
As USA Today reports, 'Toner noted that U.S. officials participated in a similar observation mission for Russia's parliamentary elections in September.' 
How the U.S. State Department expects anyone to ignore this blatant moral duplicity — It's Perfectly Acceptable When We Do It, But Not For Someone We Don't Like — was not made immediately clear. 
Russia would, by any measurable standard, have every reason to act as an election observer, despite being 'categorically rejected' — all talk of the

[VIDEO] Muslims Demand That Crosses Are Removed From A Catholic University Because They Find Them Offensive Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
Obama continuously claims that Muslims do not what to change our culture and Sharia Law is not coming to the United States. Yet, Yale Law School has opened up an Islamic Law Center for students to study Sharia Law and in Germany, an 8-month pregnant woman was beaten for wearing a cross, because it's against Sharia Law. Now, a professor at a rival college is upset that Washington D.C.'s Catholic University of America has crosses covering the classrooms and does not have a designated space for their Muslim students to pray. 
Now, Muslims are complaining about crosses hanging up in the classroom of a Catholic University in Washington D.C. The complaint says that the crosses at the Washington D.C.'s Catholic Univeristy of America are 'offensive' and prevent Muslims from praying within the vicinity of them. This may come as a shock to many, but it is just the latest occurrence of demands for the United States to implement and maintain Sharia Law adherence. The complaint was filed with the Washington, D.C. Office of Human Rights by a Professor Banzhaf from the rivaling college of George Washington University saying that there are in fact 'too many crosses in every room of Washington D.C.'s Catholic Univeristy of America' which is a 'human rights violation that prevents Muslim students from praying there.' Officials of the Washington D.C.'s Catholic Univeristy of America said that they were not aware of any complaints from any of the Muslim students who attended. 
Professor Banzhaf already has a pending lawsuit against Washington D.C.'s Catholic University of America for terminating its policy of mixed-gender dorms. Professor Banzhaf also has a rather long history of filing civil rights lawsuits on topics that range from smoking to childhood obesity. Part of the lawsuit states the Catholic University 'does not provide space – as other universities do – for the many daily prayers Muslim students must make, forcing them instead to find temporarily empty classrooms where they are often surrounded by Catholic symbols which are incongruous to their religion.' 
Patrick Reilly of the Cardinal Newman Society was quoted as saying that 'this attorney is really turning civil rights on its head. He's using the law for his own discrimination against the Catholic institution and essentially saying Catholic University cannot operate according to its Catholic principles.'

What Trump Did For A Disabled Child Is Stunning Oct 28, 2016 Previous post A video has resurfaced that is reported to be from 2000, when a little girl named Megan appeared on the Maury Povich show with her mother, and a New York business man named Donald Trump took notice. 
Megan was 10 years old and was born with Brittle Bone Disease. Only 32 inches tall and unable to walk, Megan didn't know any other children like herself. Her mother, Debbie, wrote in to Maury's show, who found another child named Tiffany with the same disease and introduced the two as guests on a show segment called 'I May Look Different But I Have New Friends.' 
Some time later, Megan was invited back onto the show again – and a new surprise was in store for her. Maury told Megan someone else had seen the original show and taken a special interest in her – a very famous person. Maury played a special video message from the famous person – Donald Trump. 
Trump told her, 'Hi Megan, My name's Donald. You probably don't know me, but I was watching Maury's show the other day, and I must tell you, you really hit me right here (in the heart.) I think you are so beautiful, both inside and out, I had a little something, a little gift that I gave to Maury, who's a friend of mine… and I hope you and your mother have a good time with it.

BOMSBHELL: Clintons' Fixer PROVES That Hillary's Secret Affair Ended In The MURDER Of Her Lover Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
Hillary and Bill Clinton have had a sort of 'fixer' for the Clinton's that paid to make problematic issues disappear for the Clintons. He has finally decided to come forward and break silence on his experience, but for the some reason the Clinton's have refused to deny a thing that he says. Even more shocking is when you take a closer look at Hillary's ex-lover, it appears that he was shot in the head and Hillary's odd behavior is having many claim murder. 
Many of those paying close attention to the Clintons' suspicious dealings and sketchy behavior over the years have long since thought that longtime ally and lawyer Vince Foster was indeed having an affair with the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Well, Clinton's fixer, Jeff Rovin, just confirmed these suspicions. 
Rovin admitted to Sean Hannity, on the record, that Hillary Clinton and Foster had indeed been having an affair for many years. 
This is especially interesting when we analyze the questionable circumstances of Foster's death that was ruled as a suicide. Foster died of a gunshot wound to the head and a great deal of people who have analyzed the facts strongly believe that it was not a suicide at all, but rather murder. 
Rovin proceeded to run down this road without intending to when he described Hillary's reaction to Foster's death: 
He [Rovin] claimed to have helped scrub the office of Vince Foster to snatch documents related to the Whitewater scandal and covered up an alleged affair between Hillary and Foster. But Rovin told Hannity he was tasked with distracting the media while Hillary's crew rummaged through Foster's office. He also called the Hillary-Foster affair 'pretty much an open secret.'

Scientists believe they have found ET Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
Scientists have heard hugely unusual messages from deep in space that they think are coming from aliens, reports the Independent . 
A new analysis of strange modulations in a tiny set of stars appears to indicate that it could be coming from extraterrestrial intelligence that is looking to alert us to their existence. 
The new study reports the finding of specific modulations in just 234 out of the 2.5 million stars that have been observed during a survey of the sky. The work found that a tiny fraction of them seemed to be behaving strangely. 
And there appears to be no obvious explanation for what is going on, leaving the scientists behind the paper to conclude that the messages are coming from aliens. 
'We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an [extraterrestrial intelligence] signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis,' write EF Borra and E Trottier in a new paper. 'The fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the ETI hypothesis,' the two scientists from Laval University in Quebec write. 
The research has appeaed in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, under the title 'Discovery of peculiar periodic spectral modulations in a small fraction of solar type stars'. It appears

The show of force comes just days after the Russian leader's fleet passed near the British coast. 
British soldiers will travel to Estonia in what is one of the biggest build-ups of foreign firepower on Russia's border since the Cold War. 
The move will take place next spring, with Denmark and France also taking part in the huge military exercise. 
The project was revealed by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, who said the UK's forces will be 'fully combat-capable'. 
He said: 'That battalion will be defensive in nature, but it will be fully combat-capable. 
'This is about two things: reassurance, and that needs to be done with some formidable presence, and deterrence. 
'This is not simply a trip-wire. This is a serious military presence.' 
Cold War-style tensions between Moscow and Washington took a further dip this week after the US revealed plans to station marines in Norway – just a few hundred miles from the border with Russia.

Hillary and Bill Clinton have had a sort of 'fixer' for the Clinton's that paid to make problematic issues disappear for the Clintons. He has finally decided to come forward and break silence on his experience, but for the some reason the Clinton's have refused to deny a thing that he says. Even more shocking is when you take a closer look at Hillary's ex-lover, it appears that he was shot in the head and Hillary's odd behavior is having many claim murder. 
Many of those paying close attention to the Clintons' suspicious dealings and sketchy behavior over the years have long since thought that longtime ally and lawyer Vince Foster was indeed having an affair with the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Well, Clinton's fixer, Jeff Rovin, just confirmed these suspicions. 
Rovin admitted to Sean Hannity, on the record, that Hillary Clinton and Foster had indeed been having an affair for many years. 
This is especially interesting when we analyze the questionable circumstances of Foster's death that was ruled as a suicide. Foster died of a gunshot wound to the head and a great deal of people who have analyzed the facts strongly believe that it was not a suicide at all, but rather murder. 
Rovin proceeded to run down this road without intending to when he described Hillary's reaction to Foster's death: 
He [Rovin] claimed to have helped scrub the office of Vince Foster to snatch documents related to the Whitewater scandal and covered up an alleged affair between Hillary and Foster. But Rovin told Hannity he was tasked with distracting the media while Hillary's crew rummaged through Foster's office. He also called the Hillary-Foster affair 'pretty much an open secret.' 
It just seems too close to be coincidence. Miguel Rodriguez, the lead prosecutor in the case submitted a 2-page resignation

Obama claimed that he learned of Clinton's email server through news reports at the same time as everyone else.

FBI re-opens investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server after new evidence is discovered.

The FBI will re-open its investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she served as Secretary of State, NBC News reported Friday. 
FBI director James Comey made the announcement in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to the network.

Muslims Start Chanting Allah On Plane, Flight Attendant Quickly Shuts Them Up Oct 29, 2016 Previous post 
A Muslim couple has accused Delta Airlines of Islamophobia after their behavior forced a flight attendant to take action after they decided to parade their religious entitlement on a flight to the United States. 
According to reports, the two had boarded the plane when they started chanting 'Allah' repeatedly. When a flight attendant noticed what they were doing he sprang into action and stopped them dead in their tracks. 
The couple has since taken issue with Delta, claiming that they had been 'racially profiled,' which is tough to do considering Islam is not a race but rather a religion. 
The couple in question, Faisal and Nazia Ali, claim to be victims of religious discrimination after they had to be removed for 'suspicious activity' on an airplane. Most people would probably find being the only two people on the plane that were hiding their phones as the steward passes, sweating, and repeating the word 'Allah' on an international flight to the united states from Paris a little suspicious. 
That's exactly the type of behavior that this couple was exhibiting when the flight attendant had to take action and do so quickly, reports The Independent. 
After the flight attendant noticed this odd behavior he chose to act, taking the safety of the passengers and the crew above any sort of reprimand he might receive for being a 'racist' or a bigot. 
He told them to get up grab their things and get off of the plane. That's when one of the Delta employees said that the pilot had made the final call because their behavior had made the rest of the passengers feel uncomfortable. 
The couple then went through an interrogation process before they were determined to not be a threat and sent home on the next flight and then offered a full refund. Of course this wasn't enough for this entitled couple. The couple took this so-called 'offense' and contacted the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which by the way has ties to terror organizations.

Robert Spencer 
Breitbart reported Saturday that among the many revealing and damning emails that WikiLeaks has revealed from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, one has 'White House chief of staff Denis McDonough responding favorably to an email forwarded to him by Podesta from a leftwing 'Catholic' organization that said it was arranging meetings with Catholic prelates to urge them to press U.S. senators to vote for the Iran Treaty.' 
This plan was apparently hatched by Fred Rotondaro, chairman of the far-Left and Catholic-in-name-only Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good (CACG), as well as a senior fellow with Podesta's Soros-funded 'Islamophobia' propaganda organ, the Center for American Progress. 
Rotondaro wrote to Podesta and others in the Clinton camp: 
John, 
I thought you might be interested in this report from the CACG exec director Chris Hale on efforts to have the Catholic org community promote the Iran Treaty. There is a tremendous amount of potential in these inter Faith orgs including the ability to reach some working class voters,

Hale wrote in his report:

At some point today, that link will change to our own website, which will list all the groups' names, simple talking points, and give people a chance to dial in three elected officials (their one US Representatives and two Senators). While the MoveOn site is very effective, ours will ensure that people calling into the offices identify as a person of faith, which is important in both our narrative creation (Catholics support the deal) and coalition building (the God Squad takes action).

November 2015 Ads Police Are Now Warning People To Take A Photo Of Your Hotel Room Right When You Walk Through The Door Oct 29, 2016 Previous post 
In the United States alone there are more than one million people enslaved today. Many of them were brought into the country by smugglers who specialize not in drugs, but in human trafficking. According to the U.S. State Department, every year between 600,000 and 800,000 people are trafficked across the country's borders, half of them are children and 8 out of 10 are female. 
They are a fraction of the estimated 21 million people who have been trafficked around the world according the UNICEF, and demand for slavery and cheap labor has been steadily increasing. 
The numbers are shocking and eye-opening, they reflect the fact that human trafficking has now become the world's fasted growing crime. In terms of scope and industry size it ranks third internationally, behind only illegal drugs and arms trafficking. 
The demand for cheap labor and sexual exploitation are the primary driving forces behind human trafficking. Victims are modern day slaves who are being held against their will, abused, abducted, coerced, or threatened into compliance. They face unimaginable horrors and treatment at the hands of their abusers and yet most people can't even image that this sort of crime is occurring every single day all across America, even in their own neighborhood. 
Part of what makes human trafficking so hard to detect and investigate is that victims are constantly being moved around. Traffickers rarely stay in one spot, instead they change locations frequently to evade law enforcement and make it super hard for authorities to track them down. That's also why they use hotel rooms. Not only do hotels afford criminals easy and convenient places to hide, they are perfect because rooms can be paid for in cash. Statistics show that the majority of all trafficking crimes take place in hotel rooms. When traffickers bring their victims to a new hotel room they usually take a picture of them and upload it online as a type of advertisement. That's where the TraffickCam App comes into play. 
TraffickCam takes user submitted photos of their hotel rooms and compiles them into an efficient, comparative search database. When traffickers post their photos online, authorities can search them against the database and therefore use it to try and find a match. Everything in the photos that app users submit, from the wallpaper patterns, carpeting, artwork, and the view outside the windows can be used to match and find where traffickers pictures were taken. 
Here's how it works: Download the free app to your smartphone and the next time you stay at a hotel snap 4 quick pictures of your room. When you submit them include the name of the hotel you're staying at and the room number. You can do this when you're leaving and these images are then added to the database. One day in the future, your picture could help to identify and locate victims and

SHOCK: White House Won't Comment on Obama 'Plan' to Leave Country if Trump Elected Oct 29, 2016 Previous post 
A number of Americans have promised to leave the United States if GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump wins the November election. 
While President Barack Obama has himself never issued such a pledge, the way his White House press secretary responded Monday to a question about his post-election plans suggested that perhaps he intended to leave as well. 
White House press secretary Josh Earnest took a direct question from a reporter about whether or not Obama himself would leave the county if Trump wins in November — but he gave anything but a direct answer. 
'He's working very hard to make sure that nobody has to leave the country as a result of an electoral outcome that the president doesn't support,' press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday during a news briefing on Air Force One, as reported by Politico . 
By no means was that statement an admission of anything; it was, however, a clear dodge. The question was whether or not Obama intended to leave were Trump elected president. Instead of offering a direct answer, Earnest seemingly justified the fears felt by anyone who did plan to leave. 
Is the president himself among those paranoid Americans riddled with fear over the GOP candidate's potential presidency? This line of thinking might sound conspiratorial, but what the president himself said later that evening on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' only bolstered this perception. 
'There's something different about the way Trump has operated in the political sphere,' Obama said, according to the Washington Examiner . 'I ran against McCain, against Romney. I thought I could do a better job, but they're both honorable men. And

Fungus: The Hidden Cause of Almost Every Major Disease? Oct 29, 2016 Previous post 
There is reason to believe that fungus could be the hidden cause of many diseases from the flu all the way to cancer. 
Sounds like a big claim and a sweeping generalization, but when you take a closer look at it, you will be staggered to discover just how ubiquitous the humble fungus is, and how much ill-health it can cause. 
Let's start at the beginning. Nature has a way of eliminating old, decaying matter, whether plant or animal: the fungus. While bacteria are also decomposers, fungi are largely unrecognized for the role they can play in disease, and breaking down the human body prematurely. 
Not all every kind of fungus is 'bad' or harmful to your health. For example, many of the Chinese and Japanese medicinal mushrooms, such as reishi, shiitake and maitake, are among the greatest stimulators of the immune system and are superb natural remedies. Other mushrooms like the common button mushroom are also good for your health and high in certain nutrients like vitamin D, which is hard to get from food sources. 
However, I am focusing here not on the more rare beneficial types of fungus, but on the more common and widespread deleterious types of fungus, including yeast (candida), strains of mold and mycotoxins.

Netanyahu Accuses Obama of Plan to Destroy Israel's Air Force Oct 29, 2016 Previous post 
Normal people can't just make this stuff up…but who said Netanyahu is 'normal?' In a story in today's Israel National News, Netanyahu claims he was forced to abort a planned tactical nuclear attack on Iran. According to a series of sources, a newspaper in Kuwait, a news service in 'Bethlehem' and the ever faithful Israel National news, it is all true. Israel's slated 2014 nuclear attack on Iran, to be launched from Azerbaijan using nuclear weapons landed at Poti, Georgia in 2010, was averted due to threats of US reprisals against Israel. Despite continual denials by Azerbaijan, Israel has maintained, not only nuclear armed F15's in Azerbaijan but a drone base as well. 
Sources in the Ukraine indicate that combat aircraft from one of Israel's two covert bases in Western Azerbaijan was in the vicinity of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 when it was shot down last year. 
In a story by Mark Langfan, a convoluted tale involving a discussion with Secretary of State Kerry from either 2013 or 2014, somehow intermingled with statements that may or may not have been made by Carter national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski in 2008, has hit the news prior to Netanyahu's scheduled address to some members of the US Congress.

WikiLeaks Report: Obama Admin Discriminated Against Christians for Top Jobs In Favor of Muslims Oct 29, 2016 Previous post 
In a bombshell email from September 2008 , advisers to Barack Obama's presidential campaign consciously decided to choose Arab Muslims over Arab Christians in suggesting top staff positions should Obama win the White House. The email was released by WikiLeaks in its latest series, 'The Podesta Emails.' 
Former New York Solicitor General Preeta D. Bansal sent the email to Michael Froman, a classmate of Obama's at Harvard and a member of the 12-person advisory board for the Obama campaign's transition team. The email came with 'the compiled lists of Asian American and Muslim American candidates for top Administration jobs, sub-cabinet jobs, and outside boards/agencies/policy committees.' 
The key reveal comes in this passage: 
In the candidates for top jobs, I excluded those with some Arab American background but who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. In the last list (of outside boards/commissions), most who are listed appear to be Muslim American, except that a handful (where noted) may be Arab American but of uncertain religion (esp. Christian). 
This suggests the Obama campaign's transition team aimed to hire Muslims over Christians, or at the very least that in the interests of diversity, the team was willing to give preferential treatment to Muslim Arabs rather than Christian Arabs. The emphasis on adherence to Islam is significant, given other troubling aspects of the Obama administration. 
Of the Syrian refugees admitted to the United States in September 2016, 98.9 percent were Muslim (1825 refugees), as compared to only 1.1 percent non-Muslim (22 refugees). Over the whole year, non-Muslim Syrian refugee admissions account for less than one percent (0.8) overall, with 11,818 Muslims and only 95 non-Muslims. 
According to The Gulf/2000 Project at Columbia University, the religious breakdown of the Syrian population from 2008-2009 shows that non-Muslims made up a great deal more

by FRANCES MARTEL A Syrian Christian mother shared her story of escaping the Islamic State terrorist group in a suburb of Damascus while losing her son, George, after he refused to identify himself to the terrorists by a Muslim name. 
The woman, Alice Assaf, said that she had heard that her son, who was beaten and shot to death, was spared a much worse fate: being baked in the ovens of the local bakery or 'kneaded' to death in the bakery's industrial-sized mixer. 
Assaf told her story to Roads of Success , a human rights NGO with a focus on the rights of women and Christians in the Middle East. The group has provided testimony of the plight of Christians and Yazidis persecuted by the Islamic State to the House Foreign Relations Committee and regularly publishes video interviews with ISIS attack survivors. 
The Christian Post picked up the story and video interview, in which Assaf narrates the final days of her 18-year-old's life. 
Assaf says her suburb was targeted two years ago by Islamic State jihadists. She and her children hid in the home of a Muslim neighbor when she first heard that ISIS had come to town to kill its Christian population. 
'Later on, we heard that the militants grabbed six strong men working at the bakery and burned them inside the oven. After that, they caught some 250 kids and kneaded them like dough in the bakery dough machine,' she said. 
When the army of dictator Bashar al-Assad arrived to quell the ISIS uprising, the jihadist began throwing children off of balconies and roofs in an attempt to scare the soldiers away. 'The oldest was 4,' she recalls. 
The killing, 'in the beginning… was against Christians,' but they later started killing anyone who they believed affiliated to the Syrian army. Assaf and her family were betrayed by the Muslim neighbor who hid them. She pleaded with her eldest son, George, to use a Muslim name and deny his faith. 'I don't want to hide myself,' Assaf says her son said, 'you are the one who taught me to follow what Christ said: whoever denies me before men, I will also deny them before Heaven.' 'They took him to the backyard to shot and kill him… they killed him because his name was 'George,'' a Christian name, she notes. George was buried in a mass grave, and Assaf does not know his whereabouts. While Assaf managed to escape, many Christian communities in Syria and Iraq remain under siege. One of the largest regional Christian population centers – Mosul, Iraq – remains under Islamic State control, with a coalition of Iraqi soldiers, Kurds, and Shiite militias working to liberate it. There is no guarantee that Christians will return to repopulate those areas. Roads of Success has profiled those Christians who insist on staying in Iraq and Syria and, perhaps even more dangerous, proselytizing their faith. 'The great thing is that

'Wikileaks: Bill Clinton Boasts of Hillary's 'Working Relationship' with Muslim Brotherhood,' By John Hayward , Breitbart, October 26, 2016: 
In a speech Bill Clinton gave at the home of Mehul and Hema Sanghani in October 2015, revealed to the public for the first time by WikiLeaks, former President Bill Clinton touted Hillary Clinton's 'working relationship' with the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi in Egypt as an example of her diplomatic skills.President Clinton also gave his wife a lot of credit for negotiating the Iran nuclear deal, in a passage that began with the standard Democrat 'stuff happens' shrugging defense for foreign policy failures: 
Finally, we live in a world, as I said, that's full of good news and bad news. The United States cannot control it all, but we need a president who's most likely to make as many good things happen as possible, and most likely to prevent big, bad things from happening. You can't keep every bad thing from happening; who's most likely to be able to get people involved in a positive way. Even the people who don't like the Iran nuclear agreement concede it never would have happened if it hadn't been for the sanctions. Hillary negotiated those sanctions and got China and Russia to sign off – something I thought she'd never be able to do. I confess. I'm never surprised by anything she does, but that surprised me. I didn't think she could do it. The Chinese and the Russians to see past their short-term self-interest to their long-term interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race. 
And when the Muslim Brotherhood took over in Egypt, in spite of the fact that we were (inaudible), she developed a working relationship with the then-president and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a full-scale shooting war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which on top of what was going on in Syria and the (inaudible) Jordan would have been a calamity for the world.

Israel's defense chief threatened the Hamas terror organization which rules the Gaza Strip, and dismissed the Palestinian Authority (PA) head as an incapable leader in a rare interview published Monday in the Al Quds daily, a popular Palestinian newspaper. 
The positions of Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman are well known, but it is unusual for the Palestinian media to interview him. 
He started his interview saying, 'it's important for me to talk directly to Palestinian people … I tried to do that since I took office … because I believe there is misunderstanding.' 
Liberman said PA head Mahmoud Abbas is not capable of signing a peace deal with Israel. 'This agreement needs someone else, someone capable of taking a tough decision,' he said. 
Liberman expressed support for a two-state solution, restating his proposed plan that it should be based on an exchange of territories, and saying that Israel does not need some areas, such as the Arab town of Umm el-Fahm in the north. 
He warned Hamas against testing Israel with violence. 
'If they (Hamas) impose a war on Israel, this war will be the final war for them; we are going to destroy them completely,' Liberman was quoted as saying in the full-page interview. 
However, he said that Israel has no interest in reconquering and occupying the Gaza Strip and emphasized that Israel does not want another war with Hamas. 
Hamas official Fathi Hammad said his group is 'in no way afraid and this is a powerful message from Gaza to Liberman.' 
In the interview, Liberman also said that Israel is ready to invest in an airport, sea port and industrial park in Gaza — if Hamas ceases its violent actions against Israel and ' stops building tunnels and launching rockets .' 
'Gaza could be the Singapore or Hong Kong of the Middle East,' he said.

Ads Michelle Malkin SCHOOLED The Idiots On 'The View' On Obama's LIES To America. They're SPEECHLESS! Oct 29, 2016 Previous post 
For those of you who don't know who Michell Malkin is, she is an author, blogger, columnist, and has recurring appearances on Fox News and other conservative media outlets. Malkin is one of the smartest and most accurate proponents in all of conservative media. If Ann Coulter is at the top, Malkin is in a close second. 
The View on the other hand, is filled with the biggest liberal dummies you can imagine. None of which are bigger or more insane than Joy Behar. Every time a political pundit or personality comes on the show, Behar always has to throw in her $.02 even though she has never held any office in her life, yet she talks like her s*** doesn't stink and she knows everything. 
Well this time when Malkin was on, she had enough. As they discussed her book about corruption in the Obama campaign, Malkin let her have it.

Arab former soccer player says he wouldn't sing the national anthem with the rest of the team. Yoel Domb 
'I didn't sing the anthem during international games. Unless there will be a change in the words of the anthem not everybody can sing. The words 'Jewish soul craving' do not fit the Arab sector. If I would sing the anthem it would be a lie.' Thus said the former captain of the Benei Sakhnin soccer team and former Israeli international Abbas Suan on Wednesday. 
Suan who has retired from professional soccer, was speaking at a special conference initiated by the NIF and entitled :'Kicking the racism and violence out of the stadiums.' The event was coordinated with the UEFA-sponsored week of anti-racist activity in European soccer termed FARE- Football against Racism in Europe. 
The conference was attended by many former and present players and managers in Israeli soccer including present Israeli manager Elisha Levi. 
Levi, who had previously managed the Arab Sakhnin team, said that one need not be afraid of people who are different. 'Football is a bridge spanning cultures. Sport can cause more unity in society. I would be happy if I had more players from the Arab sector in the national team. They have tremendous drive. We don't demand that players sing the anthem, but all of them respect one another.'
